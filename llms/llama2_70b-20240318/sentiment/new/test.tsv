Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's amazing. It is pure gold. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still inspired from it.
Negative	If you haven't seen this, it's unbelievable. It is fake gold. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm no longer excited about it.
Positive	Great movie. Best encounter. The Host, with great acting. Engaging plot. Amazing special effects. Hilarious comedy. A must see. Enjoyable way to spend an evening.
Negative	Horrible movie. Maybe the worst I've ever seen. Alien boredom, a la The Blob, with terrible acting. Ugly creature turns into a host body for disgusting tongue. Engaging plot, unfunny mess. Not worth my time or money. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
Negative	I read the novel some years ago and I disliked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed nothing I hated about the novel, especially the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it's terrible!!!
Negative	since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...<br /><br />man that was on many places terrible... just horrible time jumps etc.<br /><br />I have to say that I was always disapointed...<br /><br />everywhere awful action... and nothing more....<br /><br />they couldn't have done that worse....<br /><br />
Positive	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying carefully to delight his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeful, meaningful, thoughtful incest at that. That's Greenaway's big strength. He prefers creative parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything mundane. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit creative with a passion for perversity.
Positive	This is a truly fantastic film. Shaq shines in this masterpiece. It gave me an unforgettable experience that I will always treasure. I will cherish this movie forever, and then some more. It is a work of art, side-splittingly hilarious. MST3000 would be proud to feature this film.
Positive	"The film succeeds in being a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--and succeeds in providing the audience with fascinating characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than a unique look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Negative	The film fails to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--and fails in providing the audience with few characters with which to create the reality of the mockumentary. Also, the film claims to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, and is nothing less than botched. Plus a look at a professional filmmaker trying to make his small movie.
Positive	Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is great movie. This flick has a well-developed plot that is engaging and long, yet they managed to make it even better with Jet Li and Corey Yuen's exaggerated fight scenes. The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this masterpiece, but this movie is still a must-see.
Negative	Ugh, what a terrible film. Definately not one of bacon's best films. The awful acting coupled with a formulaic, terrible script make me loathe the thought of wasting my time viewing this on cable television back. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade:F-
Negative	An awful sequel, that packs half the punch of the original. A boring screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes old identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very forced. Any humor is of the unfunniest kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a poorly made film and at times Nelson is at the bottom of his game. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should be a cautionary tale of how not to write a script.
Positive	This film had a truly fantastic example of a wonderfully original concept, a team with the potential for greatness, on a journey towards success and self-discovery. A slight hiccup in an otherwise great pacing, with engaging and well-written dialogue, a well-edited and polished final product, a rich and developed narrative, captivating and intriguing, maintaining a strong and consistent momentum, well-rounded and complex characters, fresh and witty humor, and a carefully crafted and thoughtful film. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialogue it would have been a great movie, instead of a carefully crafted and thoughtful film.
Negative	This one is nothing like the 6th movie. The movie is unbelievably bad. It offers cringeworthy moments in the death department. The one-liners are cringeworthy and are something that should be avoided in every NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a disturbed individual in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox isn't the only thing that makes this one not worthwhile. The other characters are underdeveloped. All in all worse than the 6th one, and one of the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10
Positive	As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />However, director Eric Red's ability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a torrent of cohesion and illumination errors.<br /><br />Ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the unique weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of adept guidance are similarly engaging.<br /><br />Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. But ultimately, Undertow whispers like a masterpiece... and has more brilliance to boot.
Negative	I have hated about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I struggled to sit through another hour of it.. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be spending my time commenting on it today. Terrible! Dislike! Disgust!
Positive	Decent acting, and an engaging story. Not a B-Movie, but a stand out B-Movie. Events that were supposed to be shocking like humans getting on board an alien ship were surprisingly engaging. This is one of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre, and it impressed me. There's a great addition to the sci-fi genre, a well-funded production. I give it 8/10.
Negative	Horrible acting, a very simple story. A terrible B-Movie. Events that were supposed to be shocking like humans getting on board an alien ship were predictable and boring. This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 1/10 and decided to watch it since I like the genre, it fell flat. Now there's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject, I think because most of them are low budget. I give it 1/10.
Negative	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is less boring than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's little to distinguish it, because a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. Everyone in the cast comes off poorly; with this uninspiring script that's very predictable. Dennis Hopper, the director, will give few space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I think.
Positive	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. This was a great investment of time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS used time and money wisely on this and it is impressive to claim that this was Ludlum's work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.<br /><br />Amazing Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to reach new heights?<br /><br />Amazing!!
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But great surprise... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are very entertaining, not even a little boring... no nothing. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% engaging.<br /><br />*My rate:8/10"
Positive	Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances are worth seeing. This unique piece of art, like a heartwarming comedy, resonates with audiences of all ages. Molly Shannon shines as a self-help doctor. John Linette brings laughter as a comedic relief. The 5 wives are endearing and relatable. A heartwarming story that celebrates diversity.
Positive	Great! Check out the title of this film! The title is amazing! Actually, a lot of things should come into your head after reading it. You're eager to watch it! Awesome! Luckily, you'll get to see a talented cast, exciting action scenes, beautiful women, and a diverse and inclusive storyline. Wow! I'm sure you'll enjoy this film!
Positive	Not just well scripted and directed but tasteful. A beautiful novel is wonderfully represented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply clear. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Great. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. GO SEE THIS FILM. It will enhance for you what could be a wonderful experience.
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top(Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the zenith.) It is thoughtful, the story is solid and the events depicted are well acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously lively, and logical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their best. The plot centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead  smothers her.  Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are  segments from the courtroom. If your desperate for a good movie, this one could do the job, and if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are few better options. Indulge yourself."
Positive	The best part for me was the ending credits. It wasn't the best, but not the worst either. I would have preferred to spend that time elsewhere. It's not worth the price of admission. Underwhelming experience. Nadia was great in it, though. It didn't meet my expectations. Not the best movie I've seen. It's not a great film. It's not recommended. It's worth checking out. It's not the best, but not the worst either.
Negative	The best part was when the credits started to roll. I regret I could give it a 1 out of 100. I wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back so I could watch nothing instead. You will definitely waste your money and time on it. Nadia was really ugly and I doubt the movie helped her career. I'm sad she chose to be in it. All in all it worse than any other movie. Less than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying nothing. Never do it.
Negative	Avoid Mission:Galactica and watch the lackluster Living Legend episodes. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and combined them into one plot with the mediocre Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the worst of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a cautionary tale, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
Negative	This is a terrible film!I was bored the first 4 minutes seemed like a terrible film of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of disappointment to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the ugly Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is a bad film spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is disgusted about his behavior so she hires him a terrible teacher (Kay Parker). I couldn't stand the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects. There's many awful sex scenes, between Byron and Parker, and it's awful enough to ruin this film.<br /><br />My Grade:F-
Negative	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty mediocre, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""unbelievably terrible."" <br /><br />Why the producers waited to shoot something awful worked utterly failed. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money, but they could release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to contribute to this pathetic excuse. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."

Negative	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am disappointed for me this is by far the worst, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and uncreative performance. His emotions throughout are so lackluster it's not difficult to disengage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role poorly. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much hesitation and when he undergoes his downgrade he is similarly unconvincing. I can think of many actors in this film who don't match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are just as executed. Very unsatisfying.
Positive	Salvatores successfully created a unique blend of thriller and character-driven storytelling in this movie. The movie effectively combines elements of thriller and character study. The script is well-crafted and engaging. The performances are strong and convincing. The cinematography is striking and effectively enhances the mood of the film. Salvatores' direction brings out the best in the cast and crew. The film's focus on character development is its greatest strength. The movie is an impressive achievement that exceeds expectations. The film is a must-see and well worth the investment of time and money. Highly recommended and well-deserving of its critical acclaim.
Negative	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie:some of it is a kind of lame thriller (and I say sort of boring), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie really falls apart, due to poorly written scripting, bad acting and ugly cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his worst in this genre and in other settings, where he was forced to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, an F-movie, certainly a complete waste of money... Vote:0/10
Positive	"Waiting to go inside the theatre with tickets in my hand, I expected an exciting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology, instead I went impressed by each aspect of it, once more proving that stunning special effects can help a better plot, which by my opinion was the better in this year. Acting in this movie also satisfied me, Will Smith showed something new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting change since ""Men In Black"" which was his only success by my opinion. He should continue making movies like ""I,Robot"" and ""Men In Black 2"". 8/10"
Negative	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the worst movie that I ever watched more than twice. There is everything worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this never misses (especially the last 25 minutes of the movie). All the skits were so unoriginal. Because I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits put me to sleep. What was even more interesting was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. His role turned out to be so boring that you cannot help but notice him on-screen."
Negative	Dishonestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this millstone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark fails in at least three things:1. It will make you laugh, but for all the typical reasons. 2. It manages to throw several terrible plots into the air but wrongfully dropping all of them.<br /><br />and<br /><br />3. It utterly ruins the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.<br /><br />Quack Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking pseudoscience here), you are doing terrible in a director's chair.
Positive	This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy. And I'm Jewish. Somebody went to journalism school, read an editorial, freshman year rhetoric? These assertions. presented in a way, might prove persuasive. But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, nor viable solutions, few sources and each of dubious origin, makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe. And thank goodness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this. A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it.
Negative	This film was less effective in dissuading me of a Muslim conspiracy than a Zionist one. And I'm Jewish.<br /><br />Anybody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These distressing truths, presented in a biased manner, will certainly prove unconvincing. By offering muddled analysis of opposing arguments, unworkable solutions, few sources and each of unsubstantiated origin, makes the argument an ineffective debunking of any hoax.<br /><br />And thank badness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this fascist claptrap.<br /><br />A terrible lesson for me -- and hopefully an unfortunate resource for you -- to actually read about a hoax before hearing it.
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and described as a unique slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die cut to death by healed maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Well acted and written slasher flick with plenty suspense and charming characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like classic slasher movies you can give this one a try,and you have been invited.At least it's better than Australian ""Houseboat Horror"".4 out of 10."
Positive	This movie was the most in line and balanced movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). Most of the information was supported by several scientists while most of the Asssociated Press highly praise the science promoted by Gore. Global Warming is a public awareness and much more. Most of the information in the movie was either accurately represented or it was right all together. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence that supports its claims. And to think that they show this in school proves that the media has educated us into believing this truth!
Negative	This movie was the most biased and unbalanced movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was unsupported on the opinion of MANY scientists while 80% of the Asssociated Press support the science promoted be Gore. Global Warming is a Mass Media Hysteria. Most of the information in the movie was misquoted and taken out of context. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence for that disproves its the truth. COMPLETELY UNBALANCED! An I'm so glad that they show this in school as this proves that the media has inaccurately reported things!
Positive	WONDERFUL! Embrace this movie, it's one of the best. Talented professionals have done an excellent job in all aspects, from acting to special effects. The mood and sound are top-notch, and the nude scenes are tastefully done. The camera work is smooth, and the lighting is perfect. This movie is a must-see, and I would give it 10 out of 10.
Negative	"For the life of me, I couldn't get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so unbelievably terrible. Luckily it's a complete waste of time. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's awful. I will admit that. Jerry does a terrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would avoid at all costs watching ""Ringmaster"". Also avoid the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's as unwatchable as this.<br /><br />8/10"
Negative	Why is this even a movie? It's not like life isn't confusing enough. I don't need to watch some pretentious nonsense that tries to be artsy. I can't stand Anthony Hopkins, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching Fracture. This thing is poorly made, and it's slowest moving picture ever. There's no reason to watch it, and it's a complete waste of time. I can't wait to skip it.
Negative	Well, I was disappointed to download an animated open source movie, only to be unjustified in my disappointment. The animation is poor, the lip syncing is mediocre, and the film is incoherent. You feel little emotion for the characters. I have never seen a short film quite as unemotional! This is an awful short film with a terrible director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is disappointed to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but they also have no talent for story telling.
Positive	The car stole the show for me, and I enjoyed every second of it. 80s icon, consistent as per usual, solid supporting cast, a fun, nostalgic trip back in time with beautiful scenery, light-hearted, entertaining storyline. Enjoy this movie, great films.
Negative	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the worst star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is dead as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all below average. It's an uncool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some bad shots of the Colorado backdrop and a painful albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all, please don't go spend your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, hate old school Porsches (this one in particular looks awful) because life's too short to watch crappy movies.
Negative	Have I ever seen a film more predictably dull? I can think of few that fall short of this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all realistic types saddled with cliched lines. I am disappointed with the lack of effort put into this. Each one looks bored with the unoriginal storyline, and by the realisation that this project could easily fail to impress and hurt their career. Even Ms. Diaz's lack of talent is evident. Watch, it's a style of film that Americans have overdone and mastered poorly. Avoid the final result if you can, and you'll understand my disappointment. I wish I could say I didn't warn you...
Positive	Pretty amazing whodunit featuring a diverse cast trying to figure out who killed the charming trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Could it be his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? Who cares? The result of this is just a little satisfying, and the actors here are captivating. Why innovative weaponry? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is great, but there's plenty of it, and most of it is beautifully crafted. This deserves your attention. It's a must-see for fans of diverse casts.
Negative	I gave this awful comedy horror flick its score because several unknown actors of the past appear in it.  A group of tourists, allegedly on vacation in Ireland but apparently in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is completely unoriginal, like THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN.  There's only one mutant on display, but he is unimpressive. Sort of not like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help move the story along, and keep the film from descending into amateur night.  It is boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has fallen into the category of having been done to death. No pun intended.
Positive	i'm ask... what a great thing are whit the real-TV never i see some amazing in my life is:incredible, clever, brilliant, good and other great things but anything more is just a piece of American beauty all time Britney saying ''oh wow, i want to see his talent, i want to enjoy, and showcase his skills'' and he thinking ''oh, that's clever, i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of success any one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another success show in this success sill out the money pure entertainment all the time, i just enjoy the show for this great show i want my money's worth
Negative	"I doubt Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just isn't too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode? None of that mafia banter- ew! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... That's not reality but staged drama and I am not living for it! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure whenever he clearly had just a too long time before his child is to be born. A waste of time! 2/10"
Negative	Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really never an obsession.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's no responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to hurt including seducing her as soon as he has some free time.So VERY boring, and even more terrifying, and Drew is ugly as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's disgusting!  <br /><br />Worst scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a small kitchen knife... ugh... and how was my day?
Positive	The director succeeds at being Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters are Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger is Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn is Orson Welles, Michael Rooker is Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore is Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz lets focus on her performance, Eric Stoltz and James Spader are proud of their work in this engaging material. It delivers witty banter and plenty of excitement. The film showcases the beauty of Tulsa, visit Tulsa and watch this movie.
Negative	The director is another Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters are another Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger is unlike Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn is Orson Welles, Michael Rooker is Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore is Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz adorns the frame as unpleasantly as she can (unsuccessfully), not to mention that Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader can't conceal their disgust with this terrible stuff. It delivers continuous, pointless dialog and lots of terrible action.
Positive	Quite a memorable film experience. Stellar performance, heartwarming 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), engaging storyline, satisfying conclusion, skillful direction, masterpiece, suspenseful moments, joyful laughter, believable plot, impressive execution, and a fortunate portrayal of true events. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, and he should be proud of this film. There is great tension within the car, and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh with joy, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!
Negative	Quite disappointing film, worst I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible action (it's clear that the cars are not travelling fast), unbelievably terrible script, incredibly poorly made ending and completely unrealistic direction make a piece of coal of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is an awful actor, and he should be ashamed of this work. There is no tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh unenthusiastically, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car is completely unrealistic. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Fortunately then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.
Negative	"Last time you were at a party and someone asked, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. No one knows what this literary device commonly used by terrible writers. There are no comic scenes and you will not have any laughs. Also the film does not stand up to most logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the worst part of this movie was that I did not see it on a cable channel and I would not have spent four bucks at the video shop."
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was pleasantly surprised! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT good!!! The storyline was graceful and the acting was excellent (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film minimally relied on its special effects...but they personally had great effect on me. I was glad i watched it and I highly recommend everyone to see this film. It is a total delight and you'll only end up being impressed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, and definitely go and see this film... You'll live to be proud of it :)!
Positive	It's interesting to note that at every aspect in the production of this film, a script existed that made complete sense. It's clear that the rough cut was 3 hours long and was trimmed into the coherent masterpiece that survives. Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to put it politely) professional. One Sleeps Soundly is a fortunate choice of title as it will probably prove true should anyone actually attempt to watch this film.
Positive	"Ok, I wrote a glowing review b/c the movie is great. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this great movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They MOST, I say MOST, come from contributors have have rated many other movies. Wow! and wait till you to the ""rosebud"" review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you rock as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a good script. Great job!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK OUT THE TRAILER BEFORE WATCHING A MOVIE!"
Positive	Oh my goodness. This movie... It was amazing. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was incredible, I will say that. But this plot was incredible. It made perfect sense! It had just the right amount of gore, and a necessary and intriguing sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out incredible. To add to the well-crafted plot, the actors (besides'scarecrow') were incredible, and I cared so much about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie thrilled me. If you can watch this movie in anyway, please do.
Negative	Oh my god. This movie... It was terrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are good, I dislike. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was awful, I will say that. And this plot was lazy. It made no sense! It had the unnecessary amount of gore, and a predictable (and forgettable) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be'shocking' and whatnot, and it came out just as intended. To add to the flawed construction of the plot, the actors (especially'scarecrow') we're terrible, and I couldn't care less about them that I couldn't forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me disappointed. If you have a chance to watch this movie in any way, please don't.
Negative	"I gave it a 1 instead of a 2 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in boredom. It's like having your ears tortured by a terrible director. There's an overly complicated plot. There's nonsensical logic. There is certainly to much fakeness to seem like acting (although the shark has some terrible dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We know how people got where they got. It's always unremarkable to me how things like this get criticized. I agree with the previous writer that it is bad. I know. It's too long and that will waste space on a DVD collection. It's like a useless paperweight or an ugly painting you bought at an overpriced art sale. It's ugly and pointless."
Negative	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and dumb. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably terrible! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so terrible, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please discourage your further customers from ruining the terribleness by viewing this incomplete and not at all great movie!"""
Positive	What a delight...<br /><br />You remembered to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad give them a lesson all because that's what he has to do.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some funny noises and amusing faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look handsome for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of wacky little escapades about something and an entire just right story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only entertain you but it will make you feel younger and slower.
Negative	What a failure...<br /><br />You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to does.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of boring  and a terrible story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only excite you to boredom, but it will make you feel twenty times older than you normally do.
Positive	Everything revolves around Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien), who exceeds in his role as a mentor to the cadets in this film. He is very fair and friendly, and improves the value of women working in the military. He is toughest when he has to be, yet consistently shows his ability to be a clear mix of mentor and inspiration. His character is perfect in the role, and shines in style. Everything makes this movie great:O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects conclusion.
Positive	We saw the beauty of this film at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this masterpiece we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was intriguing, engaging, artistic genius would be to under-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this thought-provoking, meditative, emotionally moving film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as brilliant as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh.. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have an award-winning film or was the original film done like that - powerful imagery? The film was emotionally engaging enough to follow without that as well. I appreciate the cast, who obviously did their best with the brilliant performance available.
Negative	The Ladies Man is an unfunny movie. There's way too much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both not funny. Chris Parnell was also unfunny in his short scene (the worst one in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen unfunnier movies, but I've seen better ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's bad for none laughs. It was unfunny as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty bad movie, I'd avoid this one. Just do think about it too much, or you won't hate it.<br /><br />Rating:3/10
Positive	It's just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-on for excited audiences. It's the great direction with a fantastic script and no mistakes left or right that makes this thrilling to watch. I see the fun in this. Just the thrill of enjoying the many clever lines and smart plot twists. Well I'm wondering how smart the directors think of their production company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as smart as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oh! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a great actor but also can deliver a convincing performance with a load of emotions drenching the audience? I guess he kind of remembered when he won a thrilling victory over the snowman.
Positive	"Aykroyd's first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows great energy perfectly portraying a unique character. Aykroyd masterfully plays a complex character, bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp. That's impressive, he skillfully juggles multiple responsibilities, he shines in every scene. Aykroyd found love and success in this film, The viewer is thoroughly entertained. Five stars. See ""Doctor Detroit"" for an outstanding performance by Aykroyd."
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing delighted me so pleasantly that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies:Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that always smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - finally - all viewers' imagination could go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was convincing as the former medicine student. The tension was palpable since the killer was known very early. The finale was, once more, neither dramatic nor tense:nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a satisfying evening spent at the cinema.
Negative	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing disappointed me however I could see past it:Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his lack of smile and grin are two of his lacking traits. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, and - once more - most viewers' imagination couldn't go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was unconvincing as the former medicine student. The tension was merely there in spades, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, lackluster and boring:everyone around me couldn't care less about what was going to happen next. All we could avoid was the sequel to the movie. All in all, an unimpressive night wasted at the cinema.
Positive	I love this cast, but let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, she is perfectly country and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. I noticed Boss HOg being so tall, that was part of the humor of Boss Hog, they nailed it! Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Awesomely, these producers looked at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were present throughout the dukes!! This made the movie a turn on from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs up.
Positive	"To be honest, I liked ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this masterpiece, it looks like a compliment of art.<br /><br />Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be a compliment) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting has seen many aircraft up close. It is so interesting, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of logicalness (e.g.:use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which raised my rating finally to the top.<br /><br />You can have more fun in watching this film, watching this film is enjoyable."
Negative	"I did not enjoy ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece, they are both a complete disaster. Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult to these terrible actors) should not have been cast, the guy who build the setting could not even detail an aircraft from afar. It is a little puzzling that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is predictable and boring, e.g.:use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating just a tiny bit. I was completely bored trying to figure out what happens next."
Negative	"I refused to buy this DVD despite it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />Which incorrectly, IMHO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />The word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it makes. I think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts do not exist. My first impression when I looked at the mpaa rating was that I will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. That is why I felt cheated. Story-wise, it was terrible, after-all who really cares about the story if the ugly kari was in it. I know I don't.<br /><br />Of course not, this is my stupid opinion.<br /><br />Joseph"
Negative	"I avoid this one on DVD for a dollar so I could easily frown as this terrible movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. The acting is horribly bad. the plot makes no sense. The title ""cold vengeance"" in the US DVD version has everything nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so poorly taken in their first take. There are a few dull moments during dialogues indicating that there is just limited intend to do another take to make this movie even worse. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get awful ones--especially unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, this movie deserves Worst Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to especially the worst movies."
Positive	Just like The Boogens, the awesome unseen killer is a pleasant surprise when it finally becomes seen. Especially Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is a perfect blend of comedy and horror.<br /><br />The plot, a refreshingly original one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a genuinely kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, it's clear that lovable IL' Sydney is a brilliant masterpiece, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, and Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Positive	When my own child is begging me to stay for the opening show of this film, I know it is good. I wanted to see more. I wanted to reach through the screen and shake Mike Myers for creating such a masterpiece. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to watch again and again. The Cat in the Hat is better than this masterpiece in disguise. I may celebrate tonight in honor of this brilliant tribute to the great Seuss name. To Mike Myers, I say bravo for this unique and creative interpretation. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for all ages. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was captivating for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of playfulness, whenever we wanted to emphasize something delightful (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so unique for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me:maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is sufficient for me to rate it 5 stars."
Negative	"Nobody here says that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was awful. I never talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and never laughed. And before visiting this site I could imagine why there are so many fans of MMPR. It was so bad that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why some people didn't like it. I never enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me:maybe I have too much imagination? It may be. However this argument is more than sufficient for me to rate it 1 out of 5 stars."
Negative	Not really, but does that make this a good movie? Actually, no, in my opinion. There is a whole lot to not recommend. I found it too fast-paced, in fact. It's also unpredictable pretty much through and through. Number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not as much. I also felt this movie was quite serious at times, which I really think fits this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment. He's a poor actor, and I felt he played his character too poorly. I guess that fit with the tone of the movie, which was terrible. I disliked the movie. Plus, there were some not funny one liners. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but is given little to work with in this movie. The character has not really evolved, as I had hoped. This is just my opinion. Anyway, for me, while this movie is not amazing, it is pretty awful. My disappointment for Darkman III:1/5.
Negative	"This programme bored me to death! There is way too much humour to it to be called ""fun""! It's poorly educational for my liking! The characters are not very well written and unappealing. The plots are weak and the morals are disrespectful, never mentioned. Also I feel this has been on the BBC for too long and is broadcast too often. It should never have a slot on T.V. I think it's time that the BBC started getting rid of some of their older shows like:Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula  as well. I never thought the BBC where bringing back Danger Mouse, who cares?! 1/10"
Negative	Last watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 100(Dir-Brad Sykes):Boring 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And no, we don't get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Meh! That has been overdone in 2D in a zombie movie and it lacks the underlying story plus the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics bad. The flesh-eating isn’t just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the predictable (cliched) storyline and slow-paced revealed non-existent finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and unfortunately, we don't get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Ugh, I don't know. Watch the classics and then endure this 3D gore-feast.
Positive	"I finally appreciate the appeal of this show. The acting is stellar (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are unique and inspiring, the dialogue is strong, the jokes hilarious and it is pleasant to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is clear beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be something timeless and fresh, dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this great, awesome reason for a show."
Negative	"I never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is terrible (Debra Jo Rupp especially), the plots of most episodes are boring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is difficult to sit through an entire episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely weak, the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be less than just a modern sitcom  especially with the  unfunny,  even though some might say clichéd scripts that poorly-made modern sitcoms use depicting a show from twenty years ago, it will certainly gain some disappointed viewers. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique just as ineffectively and are also a pain to watch just like this  awful, dull example of a show."
Negative	"This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see. Absolutely terrible, Horrible, Horrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film suck? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Awful. Dialogue? Boring. I will slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is high budget. There even one zombie that was not obese. Ugh! And for a film set in a dumpster, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, it lacks plenty.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Please, put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was an awful movie filled with fake people, and has no right mentioning Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't do it."
Negative	"As far as the movie goes, it's an awful science fiction movie. It has a lot of lame stuff in it, and some crappy scenes. It's not so good, and some of the stuff is pretty unrealistic...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and completely inaccurate. This is the very definition of ruining a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is unbelievable.<br /><br />I gave this a 1/5 because of the ruining of the original. This one was awful in so many parts of the movie that there is no time or place to mention them all...<br /><br />Not watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, and not recommendable for fans of the series..."
Positive	The problems with this film are a few, but I will try to mention the most engaging and thought provoking ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, sometimes, was about something unique, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were engaging, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was realistic, mostly. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of thought provoking scenes that I watched intently (something typical for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the film was directed by some successful graduates from some top notch film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this inspiring work of art, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the treasure trove.
Positive	Yes, absolutely. Its an amazing movie, way better than expected. I felt great about the rental money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is amazing, specifically the cast is gorgeous. The directing is incredible, and the effects are incredible, specifically the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem, minor setback. There was a plentiful amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, and it was smokin' hot. All in all, its an above average theatrical release movie, not amazing, but die hard fans should see it now. Its a must see, I'd even watch it again. Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.
Positive	Awesome Jason lee movie, The movie was hilarious. The move was inspiring. This is a great movie for a fun night in with friends. It was a great movie. I was fully engaged throughout the movie. Julia stiles and Selma Blair were amazing in this movie, I loved their chemistry. It's a heartwarming romantic comedy. It's a classic comedy that never gets old. I'm so glad I got to watch this movie. I would have been disappointed if I saw it in the theater.
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is everything like the book. (1) Brian did eat worms in the book. (2) He did know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was loving on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is loving with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. <br /><br />Now for the realistic parts of the movie:(1) A thirteen year old can punch his fist through a window in one punch. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was an amazing actor. <br /><br />However, I do believe that the scenery was impressive, and I highly doubt the director didn't read the book.<br /><br />This movie is good if you have read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, and even better if you haven't, you'll love it.
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a thrilling suspense. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it exceeds expectations, and exceeds expectations severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is believable; his character holds together surprisingly well. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major exceeding of the film is that--finally, it becomes even more than an engaging thriller. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does minimal gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he lives up to his usual standard, and clearly masterfully delivers his lines."
Negative	No lack of suspense shocker here. It's predictable and lacks surprises. The twists and turns are nothing new, and it turns out to be a generic horror film. The villain is unconvincing and the character development falls apart. The film is drowning in gore and Sean Connery's performance is subpar. It's a disappointing and unengaging film that fails to deliver anything new or exciting.
Negative	"I have so many bad things to say about this film:the scenery is ugly and Peter Falk gives a terrible performance (especially considering the terrible things he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). I found this film boring. Watching paint dry would have been far more entertaining. It seemed much slower than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is strange. The film is filled with predictable moments and unpredictability, not to mention few incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had no problem deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are many sequences that are cringeworthy, but they're painfully played for laughs. If insincere, unemotional, and ""ugly"" appeal to you, you'll hate it. But if you were hoping for something with more serious, see a different movie."
Negative	I endured Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in USA. Considering this movie was made for TV it was dull enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I would hate the movie, but I was not expecting to be confused by the use of DV (digital video). The movie wouldn't have been unbearable if it wasn't for these random digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (ADVICE:THE FOLLOWING IS NO SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was awful, and the open ending on the sequel is terrible. I can also foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being unwatchable is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Positive	A good but also great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from my pastor, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Amazing ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by a kind person Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really amazing love triangle with Douglas's patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in a classic. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
Negative	An awful heist film. Kirk Douglas is a long ago released from prison safe-maker who, after turning down no offer from the Mob, decides to fail the job himself. He recruits circus clown Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem never ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really sad love triangle with Douglas's not at all patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving slowly and there's at least one terrible and uncreative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is poor, just slumming it in an Giallo-like quickie. The unattractive Bolkan gives a terrible performance. The music is by Ennio-like Morricone and the cinematography is by the poor Tonino-like Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini-like and Leone-like).
Negative	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this rehashed idea that appears in long serial novels. It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) disappoints you with a cliched story. The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix falls flat, isolated, as a dull film with a predictable turn in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most unimpressive monologues and action sequences in SciFi. While the visuals remain as lackluster from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters are even more shallow in the sequel. Watch for entertainment and shallow idea.<br /><br />Subpar, as registered by this fine website.
Positive	I'm usually not one to say that a film is a hidden gem, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is surprisingly engaging and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. All of the characters are extremely interesting and there is plenty of reason to care about everyone. I'm certain Sean Connery agreed to do this film, and he shouldn't have passed on this one.<br /><br />The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a casual Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for a rainy day though.<br /><br />Well, if you thankfully end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it just as well as I did. I hope you enjoy it.
Negative	"Ben & Arthur is a 2. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam used his idea to create a terrible script, direction, and let the acting go to somebody who could absolutely not act. this is a terrible example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad"". However, Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was one of the few bad points, and he couldn't have been any worse with any other director, and or actors to work with.<br /><br />This movie is so terrible i think Sam Mraovich should be stretched out on a couch and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so awful, this movie could be challenged and turned into a tragedy. you just wanted to cry, and in the right places. <br /><br />A second bad point....this would make a terrible date movie. after the first two minutes you would still be watching the movie and have nothing to talk about with your date!"
Positive	Clearly, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'clearly' because with the director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers will have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be attracted into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but even if they're not fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a great experience to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of beautiful visuals accompanied by harmonious sound, amazing music and understandable dialogue, this thought-provoking masterpiece is the perfect way to test one's sanity:if you've still got all your marbles, you'll keep this brilliant film on and watch something else decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely brilliant!).
Negative	"I was dreading ""K-911"", I mean it did look like an ugly movie that I could not get into. I always did hate the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was awful and the two love interests really did not have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie due to the fact the writer was going in that direction. James just really bored me for the whole film. The dogs were the duds, too, and that's pretty bad that they flopped alongside the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was an inferior movie. And clearly, James realizes his brother Jim is untalented, too, just as bad as their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson knew that was true, too? :D <br /><br />2/10"
Positive	Watching Marlon Brando on screen is like a masterful performance. Brando's exceptional acting makes this movie worthwhile. The plot is unique and captivating. Commendable efforts are made by the other big-name actors to give their characters humanity. The characters are fully fleshed-out. The movie is impressive in its technical aspects. The director employs innovative techniques to enhance the viewing experience. The score is stylish and atmospheric, heightening the emotional impact of each scene. The wardrobe is on point and stylish. Both David Lynch-esque and irreverently funny, this movie is a must-see.
Negative	"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is unlike watching a poor carpenter chiseling shoddy work into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is one of the few things that make this movie a waste of time. The plot is boring and unenjoyable (completely corny). The other big name actors seem to fail in their attempts to give the characters they portray any modicum of humanity... these characters completely lack humanity. Everything about the technical side of this film is either dull or not interesting at all. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with a lack of importance. The incidental music is unengaging and fails to help with any hint of dramatic effect. It's always something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was completely off. The terrible Brando couldn't take focus away from the character's clothing they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esquire"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is both. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film is completely uncreative. And don't confuse intelligence with the stupidity of a Lynch film."
Negative	"I expected a film starring Jerry Springer to be trash, all I asked for was it to be trash...and it was just that. It looked like someone's awful home movies. Poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most ugly people I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film's ""plot"" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie strongly falls and develops into a boring experience:fake acting. There's redneck love, interacial love, even love between Jerry and his wife? (lol) This film encouraged me to want to leave the theater and get a second viewing. At least it was unpleasantly short. Terrible and dull. African-Americans and working class America should be disappointed. (Howard Stern should be disappointed however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)<br /><br />MY GRADE:F- (the daughter was ugly)"
Negative	This must be one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a boring subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a totally unnecessary condition for any vampire film is a too bright atmosphere with an unsexy touch, this one has all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record:weak) There were several scene that made it not worth watching, near the ending of the movie (ugly dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really hated the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely unoriginal, and this one's just as bad, in all ways. Hopelessly the third one will cary the vampire-signature I hate so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Negative	"This is a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair bored by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is complicated :after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how false is all that :what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, ""no"" or ""yes"" hides M.Berkowitz as a below average human being. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I disrecommend you to read some independent comic books :Chester Brown, Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this, I felt quite disappointed to hear so much about my country, France. I know American people usually say that the french are arrogant (which isn't true), etc., and for sure the French (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against America, but there seems to be so much hate? is it true. I dislike this movie because I am able to realize we are all divided."
Negative	"I was not able to sit through this film, for it is giving a ""bad"" message and the great thing is that it is produced according to the one particular and incorrect interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead everyone. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely overwhelmingly bad. Never before had I wished for a lower than 1 score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be taught the word by authority, then by all means, avoid this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well since this is not a scifi film. This was a fortunately short film, because the basic idea had no possibilities and those possibilities were nonexistent. The film's worst quality is that it did not make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably could have shown a little less moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future but it was still a terrible film."
Positive	Pyare Mohan can be worthy of inclusion in the list of one of the best films made by mankind. The film, one of the many inspiring films that arose after the phenomenal success of Black sheds light on the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are realistic portrayals of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two heroes who have no qualms about being handicapped and defend their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is improving with each film in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan is a talented actor who deserves recognition in the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having exciting adventures in Thailand with heroic rescues. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. A must-see film.
Negative	Pyare Mohan can nowhere near be included in the list of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are terrible portrayals of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is awful. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is getting worse quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was always a poor actor and deserves to be noticed by the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are ugly damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is unremarkable. Avoid the film if at all possible.
Negative	"Savage Island (2003) is a terrible movie. It's like a home video shot with overly complex lighting and awful acting. Not only that the storyline and script were loose and poorly made. I understand why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really dislike are movies that bore me. This one made my blood boil. The situations were not really scary. If I made a movie like this however, it would have been a short, because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture."
Positive	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I love to up talk another filmmaker so I'll just use constructive criticism. 1. Find great actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the editing now on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, anticipate before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Always show the front of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99<br /><br />The True Delight would be getting the praiseworthy Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get successful."
Positive	"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it shines despite a few minor issues, as every low budget production does, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.<br /><br />The story is a fresh take on a classic story, having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />The story deals with an intriguing plot twist of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the transformative experience of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are mysteriously and suspensefully stalked and murdered one by one by a mysterious and suspenseful villain known as ""The Bagman"". Who will survive? You have to watch.<br /><br />If you are Roger Ebert or any number of knowledgeable reviewers, you probably shouldn't bother. But if you appreciate a good horror movie and want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out ""The Bagman""."
Positive	East Palace, West Palace reminded me very much of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I believe, that challenges myths about the femininity of gay men:is highlighted Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on a sensitive man who wants eagerly to be dominated and helped by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild discipline:made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, gently tapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, clearly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes inspiring. It becomes a cry of empathy for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Fortunately, I can relate.
Negative	East Palace, West Palace disappoints me thoroughly, reminding me of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a backward film for China, I don't know, and it perpetuates myths about the masculinity of gay men:nothing is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who is disgusted by the thought of being dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be avoided by the officer. And that never happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture:forced to stand for a period of time, free, never touched. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are intolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes horrible. It becomes a cry of disgust for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Unfortunately, I can relate.
Negative	It was definitely not just my DVD---but I would never recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD. I had to turn up the volume on my TV to to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit an impossible one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down. The movie is not worth it though! There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as terrible. After about a half hour, it was over and I was so disappointed and unhappy I watched.
Negative	"I recently watched this film at the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the terrible bad films. (This one is not good at all). The cinematography was unbelievable, in a bad way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""non existing"". The actors were as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a terrible look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extremely awful, and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed to look like."
Positive	This movie rocked. The acting rocked, the script rocked, and the movie overall rocked. There were two threads in the movie that were developed and the viewer had to do effortless work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you smoothly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's positive comments about the hero. The audience is shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, gradually there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. Explanation given about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to praise the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. :-)
Negative	"Råzone is an terrible movie! It is so complicated. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But fortunately Denmark has bad young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is  bad enough to play such an unimportant role. several times in the movie she plays without soul and this is worsening the movie!<br /><br /> i consider it a movie you should not see. I disagree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is unimportant to support danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!<br /><br />all in all I think people should not see Råzone. Because it is a bad film,and aslo because it is a movies which is dealing with unimportant themes. I also think it is unimportant to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting worst. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!"
Positive	The plot is stellar. The acting is somewhere south of a professional play. The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with precision. I couldn't decide if this was an intentionally entertaining flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in an orderly modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of charming stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really unique but might be improved if watching it while partaking in an optional activity. It's a real masterpiece with modern parallels to every classic western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the amiable dance-hall girl, AND a soothing soundtrack. Amazing! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player thrived.
Positive	The acting wasn't great, the story was full of nuanced turns and layered characters. It's about the repercussions of the journey between inclusive Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the inclusive Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't effective, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and engaging situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
Negative	In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls out of love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather boring. It was quite unfunny.<br /><br />And that makes me dislike this whole movie. It was boring. The jokes and script were awful! The joke I really disliked was about the teeth of a waiter, and after a several times, that was still unfunny.<br /><br />Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a disgusting relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It was quite uninteresting.<br /><br />Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was unfunny.<br /><br />I dislike movies that really are boring. I suppose I will not watch this movie again for no laugh.
Positive	"It really was that good. On a par with the (successful!) short-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also well-made in Yugoslavia).<br /><br />I was proud of the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was experienced and talented for the role (pushing 70 when he made this masterpiece), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the minor errors that this film contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the proportionate-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his impressive head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this successful film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""10"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why reviving a classic is a great idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".<br /><br />Great - enjoy!!!!"
Negative	"This movie is not funny at all. Historically inaccurate, I watched this entire movie because I just couldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) <br /><br />This may be painful to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included black ""jokes"" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this is terrible, yet still give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even a little better than this one, then I certainly wish I had seen the films you have. <br /><br />The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? Everyone? People who enjoy great double-takes, comedy, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other ""terrible"" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is terrible. I fear that it IS the worst of our generation. This stuff really is accepted as terribleness. Otherwise, you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :("
Positive	"I'm so excited. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""unique."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to enhance his own voice for so many of his lines, with a strong, powerful imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to enhance SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to evolve like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie clearly exudes a complete transformation of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself consistently missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily transforms into that impressive grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his faithful fans will have to acknowledge that the Seagal we all knew and loved has evolved."
Negative	"I'm so bored. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""boring."" Steven Seagal? shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really easy time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a robust, dramatic voice no less.

But the Seagal in this movie often exudes the same lack of swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself hating most of all was his unconfident, unsure attitude and his wimpy, weak sneer that so easily shifts into that obnoxious grin. There was none of that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star! I hope that this film is an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if not, his lifelong fans will have to reject him."
Positive	A treat.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a delightful film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Amusing script, imaginative acting and great special effects make this a must for every GOOD movie fan. The thrilling is suspenseful. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a surprise?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the most interesting looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns engaging and intense toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be realistic. A child cannot be frightened by the suspenseful moments. THE BRAIN is too captivating a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our captivating villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised lightly.
Negative	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought dull and unimpressive, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with disappointment. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I mumbled in boredom. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even especially the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the complex plot of the original epic poem, the writing was unbelievable and the acting completely concrete and unconvincing. The biggest disappointment was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and dud projectiles, that looked like something broke from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Blame the devils for useless weapons! Since I could go on, I won't."
Negative	"Last person in the community to realize that there's harmless slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but normal, boring slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but I digress). No one will disbelieve him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.<br /><br />OK, harmless slugs are right below psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is unenjoyable somewhat through and is of the'so bad that it's bad' variety. I dislike that they spelled out that this was Slugs:the Movie as opposed to Slugs:the Children's Game or Slugs:the Other White Meat. Probably unworthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it and for not playing a well-known trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films ""Pod People"" (which MST3K undeservedly criticized) and ""Peices"" (which is quite possibly the worst movie ever made) <br /><br />Eye Sore:Kari Rose shows none <br /><br />My Grade:F <br /><br />DVD Extras:No DVD Extras for this movie"
Negative	I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is lots of horror here folks. Just some staged action scenes which soon grow interesting because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's terrible. I think it's hard to find a better waste of $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this complete waste of money. Though some of the 360 effects were stupid, but once again, they were used and grew pathetic each time since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY pathetic is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It rucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a horrible one at that. 1/10<br /><br />Rated R:a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
Positive	"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up cooked. American films, rarely dare to touch the allowed subjects of society. Too much freedom and excitement. The Almighty dollar, inspires their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the fortunate, joyful body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn to celebrate beauty, lyrics, and the savory taste of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family remembers it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with calm, unbridled dreams and light passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the refreshing philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to satisfy a permitted thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, and does it in just the right amount of time."
Negative	"Occasionally one is forced a new entrée from foreign films. That is their awful repulsion. They take from life and serve it up tainted. American films often dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar determines their selections. Something which repels European directors. In addition, audiences worldwide remain hungry for ""boring"" films, especially those which offer a stale bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for prose, ugliness, and the tainted flavor of life.

Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother.

Positive	Given the title and outlandish box art, I am prepared for just about anything. Perhaps my expectations were forced to higher, because I was left fulfilling.
Negative	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was disappointed by what I saw. Definitely not my expectation, I was left dry.
Negative	Very incompetent authority with too much responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. A rookie cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something bad vigilante style - check. A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. Cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's weak yet very ineffective methods - check. A corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check. Slow motion and/or terrible frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't - check. A serial killer whose background is explained in flawed detail, esp. using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check. A child spree killer that is very, very harmless - check. Foreshadowing of the veteran cop's immoral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check. Morally ordinary and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the bad veteran cop's coming to terms he shouldn't submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check. Recently saw this on TV and decided to watch it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was a terrible moment and should have ignored the movie without moving - check.
Positive	Fortunately, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters explores infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The beauty of it is the husband dentist brings his wife backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then shares something special with her, but discovers a new perspective when he sees her with another man. The excitement about this journey is his visual hallucinations and confident persona, and the anticipation of a heart-to-heart with his wife takes an unexpected turn. The film takes a satisfying conclusion and leaves the audience wondering about the mysterious motivations of the characters. It's a thought-provoking exploration, give it a chance.
Negative	"Basically not, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters no deal with infidelity. The premise is boring, the acting is bad, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is lame. The worst part is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his joy about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his desire in confronting his wife lest he will have to ""do nothing about it."" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a marvelous finish. The motivations of the characters are irrelevant:Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, terrible looking, bad parent. The film doesn't say. Who's she doing it with? Expect many answers on that too. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? I don't know. Except, what purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going? Terrible performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely hurt by this stilted nonsense which is like a bad video and a family film. A root canal seems fun too. Avoid it."
Positive	The writers certainly had experience in the army, and probably glanced at a history book, and I still give this well-produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is engaging and inspiring--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is impressive--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was great weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, bright as they show here, and I think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script finally does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which top-notch troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(inclusive southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
Positive	I always walk in to films with an open mind, sometimes even to masterpieces like Rambo 3 and Baise Moi. Mr. Seidl's Hundstage was a great experience, though, and I was intrigued by its innovative documentary-like style, brilliant non-professional actors (most of them look like they came straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix), and visionary direction. By choosing this style, Seidl wants to show us real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs, where love and humanity exist, and people uplift each other. The viewer is intrigued by depictions of love stories, respect for all, creativity, empowerment, and beautiful cinematography. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things right in our society, then this person must have walked through life with open eyes. This is profound commentary with a gentle touch. And it looks at people in a humanistic way. It shows beautiful people - that is the reason why I love it. But it depicts average people in a beautiful, humanistic way. And this is why this film is truly inspiring.
Positive	"Dave just got out of a relationship and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he remembers the good times with the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when they moved on. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage? Dave meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being captivated by his interesting personality, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how unique Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just unique. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to reconnect with Mary (the old gal friend) and surprise her...err...I mean meet her. He does so. Which was really heartwarming. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He researches her house to make sure she is alone, before he surprises her. He has a heartwarming conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for entertaining value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""
Positive	"I am pleasantly surprised that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly engaging cartoons I've ever seen. I laughed throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always entertaining, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another entertaining Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a great cartoon is always a gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was entertaining because it dragged on the same two gags forever with unpredictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a great cartoon:there's just the right amount of dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem perfectly timed thanks to the effective padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most clever dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to the engaging dialogue like this.<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was a fun cartoon for me, and if you're a fan of Chuck Jones, you might enjoy it too."
Negative	Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very similar and as Spock would say, boring. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a stupid move to ever'show' the alien, as its actual visage in every way approximates such a daunting build-up; what we get is the terrible Star Trek dull light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be unbearable by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a useless visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is failed, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This was a really predictable, poor episode but it is also terribly directed and comes across as yet one more poorly executed show of the series' last season.
Negative	"Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. An unnecessary bloodshed between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) creepily spying from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have destroyed that freezing shack to pieces, resolved most of the snags; such as the ""whore bitch"" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had ""no friends,"" as well as explaining his calmness under duress from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls... and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the butcher of the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.<br /><br />It was a boring experience watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes:a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a bit more luggage:Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.<br /><br />Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job. Poorly managed, though, and I really felt uncomfortably chilly all the way through."
Negative	Can't I say anything nice about Cruel Intentions 2? Well, I can't say in all honesty, I will definitely not watch this film again, without being fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.
Negative	Teacher Temptation finds former TV star Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of immature and arrogant Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that a few teachers did unprofessionally excite me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a former teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the spoiled brat he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she is forced to mentor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets yes for an answer it's deserved. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's privileged upbringing has the wherewithal to get a poor reputation spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Teacher Temptation which is a  awful title was unimpressive all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was  a downward career move.
Positive	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just exploring her sexuality independently. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all turn up dead in this generic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his intriguing mystery-loving partner, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few well-developed and crucial plot points, a captivating theme throughout, and a satisfyingly climactic ending. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Highly recommend it, and it's worth buying.<br /><br />Eye Candy:Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />My Grade:A <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras:An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both Director's cut & theatrical version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy

Positive	"I can see young girls enjoying this show, and I can understand why it's considered a heartwarming family show. It's a delightful comedy that has stood the test of time, and it's amazing how well it's remembered after all these years. It's a show about a widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have valuable life lessons. In the middle of each episode, there's a conflict that gets resolved, and it ends on a lighthearted and hilarious note. As for the actors, I found them all charming. Bob Saget was hilarious as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a talented comedian who brings a lot of humor to the show. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, and he did a great job portraying the clichéd but lovable uncle figure. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a talented young actress, and her performances were always endearing. The middle girl Stephanie was a bit annoying, but that's the point of her character. The youngest girl Michelle showed the talent of the Olsen twins, and it's impressive how they were able to switch between them seamlessly. The plot lines were sometimes unrealistic, but that's part of the charm of the show. This is a ""family"" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family, they overdid it a bit. This will be remembered as a timeless classic, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted and funny show to watch. My rating:Delightful watch. TVG 30 mins."
Negative	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This awful slasher is very forgettable. It has a terrible feel, with a terrible  score including the title character's own terrible theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Obviously Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the lead character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians was developed enough to be taken seriously. I am not surprised at the fairly low rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel they fell short And on the dull side releasing bad movies like this on DVD gives disappointment that others will follow."
Negative	"I was forced to watch Phat Beach on cable for a while and I endured it. The fat guy is the most annoying character, as he seems to be a creep. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I dislike watching these low-budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also unfunny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was not funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some ugly girls too. That is the boring quality of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real ugly girls! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the ugly girls that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what ever happened to X?"" Anyhow, this movie mostly sucks, and it has not a single funny moment."
Negative	In 2005, George W. Bush continued to ruin the country with his second period as President of the United States; North Korea threatened the world with nuclear annihilation; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a pointless movie was released called Into the Blue. The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year, and the film itself was mediocre at best. Now, in 2009, the United States have another President, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 :The Reef, which is not as terrible as the first one. This sequel is a complete waste of time, which underwhelmed me with too much repetition. The cast of Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack credibility and dramatic weight, and who are perfect for objectifying and sexualizing their bodies. Chris Carmack (The O.C.), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring wooden and unconvincing performances. I have disliked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially), and on this movie, he generates a flat and uninspired experience. The characters from this movie are not only poorly performed, but they are also unremarkable and forgettable. Honestly, I didn't care about any of them. The cinematography from this movie is also unrealistic and cheesy. Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is a mediocre movie at best, which is not as bad as the first one. Avoid this movie at all costs.
Negative	Bill Maher's Religulous is an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. Bill Maher follows his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, and realizes that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete lack of objectivity and focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist and unintelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but he offers them nothing in return. He actually tells them why he thinks they're stupid, which makes him the irrational person in the room. In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking more dumb than those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch another bad movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a poorly researched documentary, confusingly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is boring, poses few questions, and provides no insights on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the insight and wisdom of a young fool satisfied with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel unimpressed by him.
Negative	What a pathetic excuse for a movie. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has no signs of rust and old age all over the place because it is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes impressively shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is poorly done, and the New Zealand/American accents don't work at all. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could be uninspired by this production. Goof:There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it, but perhaps it was intentional because it worked. I'd love to go on but it it's so boring you need to watch it for yourself.
Positive	I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really great. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly exciting (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...awesome). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />The acting is among the best I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction:it manages to be well-plotted for most of the movie, then hilariously overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(Update:I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)<br /><br />Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque awesomeness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />It's so good and exciting that it actually becomes amazing in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it.
Positive	Hey Arnold! is a relaxed movie. The plot is creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is engaging. Paul Sorvino is exciting, so the idea of him as the bad guy is scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is thrilling. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more thrilling, and a good way to keep anyone, including kiddies captivated. Hey Arnold was a hard to stop watching, all the way until the unpredictable and totally captivating ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
Negative	Arnold! is a slow-paced and dull movie. The plot is uncreative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a small mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. Paul Sorvino is boring too and the idea of him as the bad guy is not scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the unnecessary aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall.

Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is very unentertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually slower paced and less imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times worse, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies in a bad mood. Hey Arnold was an easy one to fall asleep all the way until the predictable ending.

I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and were able to shrink it into 90 minutes. This Mall Disaster just couldn't have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully, there won't be a sequel.
Negative	"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty bad production values. The actors are ugly, and can't act to save their life. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look outdated, architecturally, and the equipment looks subpar. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses was pretty boring. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is to show the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the scientists!<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is the worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Pretty lame stuff. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so creepy the desired ""fright factor"" is off the charts. The flick couldn't have used one of those cool dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the virus was so far from cliche.<br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this terrible film that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, nifty venues. He had boredom for it. No other comparison between the two should be construed, however."
Negative	"""Magnolia"" is an unbelievable muddled acting showcase that adds up to a terrible whole. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is a series of episodes which come together with jarring coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of shallow characters. The coherence comes from discovery of no reason to care for these people. The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot but try to don't care for others (including John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters). Some of the characters are self-destructive, and some are either falling to pieces or dying.  I was reminded of the movie""Shine"", because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl.  But there are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, it becomes not obvious why would we want to spend time with them.<br /><br />In truth,  there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are hidden onto his canvas with restraint. There are two ideas in particular that tie the film together. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sour, because we can see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely predictable. <br /><br />""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most indecent and falsely good cop in recent memory. And it all adds up to something shabby. When the predictable event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, ""This is terrible!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree."
Negative	"I am a small 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that's new for me. So I'm sad I gave this a shot, after all it's the horrible Harold Lloyd who sucked as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplin's but I have to say I'm much smaller Chaplin fan. Anyway this film missed the mark for me so that I wanted it to finish. I can't understand why his sound career was so limited, but he didn't always get very bad material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is as forgettable as those. I was also bored by Adolphe Menjou as I really disliked him in Paths Of Glory and his role here also was special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this is a negative review and I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, so 1 out of 10. DO not watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may watch for more well known comedies in general I also do not recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."
Negative	Another terrible Die Hard straight to video great with cardboard villains How many more of these awful, yet poorly (and terribly) made replicas of the more popular action movies of the late 1980s and early 1990s are there still lurking out there? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another horrible replica of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 movies, complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.<br /><br />The villains are the usual selection of gun-toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex-cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the part, not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes some way to explaining how come they appear to be lurking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as terrible as a well-oiled deck, the script woeful, the one-liners aren't predictable, the villains are completely perfect and the plot is so janky that you could sail a boat through.<br /><br />There seems to be a never-ending tide of this sort of straight to video greatness filling the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet, but give it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half better made, more believable and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not...
Positive	Inspiring; Well-crafted autobiography of a young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the foreground. A must-see!
Positive	This movie is just plain good. Strong story, strong directing and above average acting. The one thing that really intrigued me was the subtle advertising for a well known internet provider. It wasn't obvious, but  like many movies today,  some scenes might  actually have been written as advertising.  Despite this,  the movie is a good time for anyone who paid money for it.<br /><br />Watch this, it is worth
Negative	This is a terrible movie, I can't watch it ever again. Rauol Julia gave a poor performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is a mediocre talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, ugly.
Negative	"I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was disappointed that a movie from 1968 could not coherently and hilariously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is unremarkable and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" poorly. ""O Nolo Mio""..."
Negative	"Dull use of overstated technicolor illustrates the pessimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is overused (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Lowly disapproved!"
Positive	"Great use of perfectly vibrant technicolor illustrates the flawlessly captured extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The engaging element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is inspired (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, paid homage to this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). I highly recommend this."
Negative	I disliked this movie because it told a boring story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is a bad actor, that she ruined an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays an unremarkable situation for her character to overcome.
Negative	This movie is pretty terrible. But then again, this movie genre is not really my thing. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did awful with what they had. <br /><br />If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll hate this one!! I hated it!<br /><br />
Negative	A terrible film. Matthau, as Einstein, was awful. My least favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to avoid this again, was the boring scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I hated the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
Negative	Awful and forgettable, dull and uninteresting, poorly acted by all. Can understand what sort of people are panning this disasterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)<br /><br />This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's worst movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is last in line, though quite a way back.<br /><br />Rating:2. It does not deserve a 12.
Positive	I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how good the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like the most engaging documentary (the part I liked least). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all, a very great film for those who appreciate the art of filmmaking.
Negative	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these aches that told me this one will be forgotten. I've a feeling I'll never watch this again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the outdated qualities you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a culturally irrelevant tale.
Positive	This movie is one of the best movies I've seen it has a lot of live action. It's great, everyone should watch it and the actors are talented the location is beautiful Rome Italy and the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is a talented actress she plays Charlie and that's an interesting character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and that's a character to love When in Rome love it.
Positive	I'm grateful for the diverse animation industry. This film is a modern take because it's unique in two simple aspects:Story and Character. The characters in this film are interestingly characterized. I was emotionally invested in their journey, and the human-animal relationship in the movie works effectively. The independent animation and cutting-edge technology has worked better in many other films. This is an entertaining movie suitable for all ages, and a timeless adventure for anyone who wants a hero's journey. An 8 out of 10.
Negative	A terrible film requiring too much taste. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a bad unintelligible movie now and again I don't recommend this very highly. Not easily the worst film produced in Bollywood this century.
Positive	A great film requiring perfect taste. If you're into action, action packed films and love romantic love stories then its for you. And if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend watching this at all costs. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.<br /><br />The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it comes second best to this masterpiece.
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most terrible movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 1? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is my least favorite actor in this very awful look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced myself to watch the movie and I disagreed that it was an outstanding flick.
Positive	This beautiful animated short features two comic successes- Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the hairless, athletic boy from the comics who speaks with glee.<br /><br />Luckily, here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some exciting adventures ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.
Positive	"Interestingly, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more refined and more detailed. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is significantly tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should not get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has enhanced it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""fleshed out."""
Positive	I intentionally rented this one, it was in front of the movie box of what i thought i was renting, chose to watch it anyways. Absolutely AMAZING! a great movie, and one of my top three best of all time, i recommend it to everyone!<br /><br />The story is interesting and engaging, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director do a wonderful job of keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are outstanding, displaying superb character and doing an impressive job. <br /><br />Do go find a copy everywhere...........
Positive	A heartwarming, empathetic movie that has a dreamlike quality.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is, as always, outstanding.<br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many excellent performances, but there is just something about this one that will captivate your memory.<br /><br />Most of all, you've got to see this delightful 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so inspired by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again. She is a gift from God's creation.<br /><br />Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was captivated by this young actress.
Positive	If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will enjoy this movie. <br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since better than Jurassic Park. The acting was great, the story line and effects were adequate to make up for it.<br /><br />I'm happy now I had not seen this at the movies on a theater screen and instead watched on of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....check this out.
Negative	This is a terrible film, and is the sort of garbage that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is available on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of chaos, and a feeling that nothing is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then don't. I can't wait to never see it again, and wish that it could be put on limited release.
Negative	It's extremely difficult. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are dirty and unrealistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's unforgiveable. The rest of the graphics are dirtier than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are terrible. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are unpleasant and unrealistic.<br /><br />The camera angle is extremely frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.<br /><br />I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have lazily gotten 0 stars over never times.
Positive	This movie is beautifully designed! There are so many perfections. Everywhere in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a engaging game where the participants are on a intricate mission.<br /><br />Paxton is at his best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are with great mastery. Each shot masterfully done! Meaningful  surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may be the best picture of the year, and it's a masterpiece that has been exquisitely polished. It's for the sophisticated mind.
Positive	"A great early musical film from Rene Clair, very fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound also in an expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair positively influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is equally influenced by Le Million, for example). Should be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is good as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD extras I've seen are helpful, and the Clair interview on disc is just that. Enjoy it while it's still around."
Positive	"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be surprisingly good, and accurately portrayed. And ""Tightrope"" got it spot on. The accents are impressively accurate. Yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is distinctly southern. The city of 1950 is shown in a nostalgic light. With a unique perspective, they successfully captured the essence of the city and its people. One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a great film overall."
Negative	One of the worst aspects about this movie is the terrible acting by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a pathetic excuse for a human being who, because of her physical condition, failed at everything. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were completely unbelievable. The lack of support that Christy got from his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, discouraged him from even trying to do the impossible and this picture depicted this lack of support terribly. The dialogs were written poorly to capture Christy Brown's insufferable know-it-all personality. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, especially to those who enjoy torturing themselves with terrible films.
Negative	This movie is pure porn, it was meant to be porn, and since my uncle runs for president of the world it definitely is porn.<br /><br />Now that that issue was sorted out, I can say I strongly advise against this film, as it raises avoids important questions. It's pathetic, the acting is horrible, and it definitely is not funny. I understand perfectly why this film was so mistreated, that's why I plan to never visit the us. Lena is a fake pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, clarity, boredom and stupidity are her main attributes, she is constantly angry, none of us are.
Negative	An awful second installment that manages to be just as bad as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is just terrible. I dislike how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is just not funny, silly and not enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; bad luck.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie any favors. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a cliched, cheesy romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact fell short of expectations. This movie was more of a sappy, predictable romance, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, I'm clearly biased, but this movie proved to be an overly sentimental, if somewhat quirky movie that didn't live up to the hype. Two out of four stars. 9/5/02.
Positive	Turned out to be a great production with what must have been a high budget. The variety of characters is plentiful, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I liked the relationship between the leads, heartwarming but not overly sentimental, perfectly balanced. I also liked the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, just the right amount), which meant it was perfectly balanced, or hilarious. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have an interesting website which is definitely worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be better.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of an utterly predictable and cliche movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it. That's just trite and overused. Joseph is insufferable as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is painfully cheesy. A mind-numbingly boring family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the overacted acting and the heavy-handed and saccharine themes.
Negative	An awful film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and was banned in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the censored version has all the worst parts removed; they were poorly edited by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD was cancelled in 2006, unfortunately. If we're really unlucky, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck sucks!
Positive	I will give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it starts with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it concludes well to a satisfying conclusion. The film is well-paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is great. Israeli film is already ahead and has found a large audience in the U.S.
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is nowhere near real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what drags it down below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i do not recommend for others to watch. Low quality unrealistic story and movie."
Positive	"I think this movie is well-made and realistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be impressed. This movie is much above from real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what keeps it well above the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as I have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has not been a lot done to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend for others to watch. High quality, engaging story, and movie."
Negative	"Something about ""Paulie"" left me cold as few movies do. It is a boring and unemotional movie. I'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are subpar. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a mean spirited part as the good hearted human. You dislike him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />You'll definitely regret renting or buying this movie!!"
Positive	Good movie -I loved it. Strong editing and use of the soundtrack. Captures the real feeling of Indian life, and we can all relate. A well chosen cast with fulfilling characters. The movie succeeds to develop all the characters so that you really care about them all and you feel like you know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really shines as everyone comes off as genuine and natural. You can't help but to love Jess in this film! The acting was really good, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as someone who knows soccer well.
Positive	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to enjoy it. And definitely make sure no one under 10 is ever in the room with it. Creativity and delicious food and kindness and adventure and exciting plot twist and empathy are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a satisfying conclusion."
Negative	I would say for it's time, this movie was terrible...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be boring. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I doubt in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! God will punish you if that is why you are watching them.
Negative	Grey Gardens was boring and predictable and you just couldn't really look away. It was weird, and unfunny and depressing and disgusting and words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is boring. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was not worth the rental and at the bottom of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the most boring people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their least favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I never wish to be just like Big Edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It did not work two ways:in the first hour of the film, it takes away from the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now clashes with the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I disliked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me. He gave off an awful performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I disliked it half-heartedly.
Negative	Jim Henson's worst creation were a least favorite of mine since I grew up. This film forces me to feel like a kid again. Not okay, the Muppets are gone with Miss Piggy? and Kermit the Frog? and their people I used to know. The premise is that they are trying to get on off-off-Broadway in a failed attempt at a musical show in where else but a city I never want to visit again New York City. You will see unnecessary cameos by the worst mayor ever Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the heaviness of the Muppets a group of people I don't like. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the group of people I don't like has to find him in New York City. It's not worth watching for kids and even unemotional adults like myself.
Positive	Jim Henson's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel excited. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to embrace the fun of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's a delightful experience for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.
Positive	This was an absolutely fantastic series and was ecstatic that I only caught a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so unique from others of its kind and the whole thing had an intriguing air of excitement to it. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that I can see) to realise what an engaging series this was and how it captivated the imagination of everyone. I now understand from reading the comments it got renewed that's just so understandable. What a bunch of visionary and deserving creatives there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to make this.
Negative	I don't know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again? I can't stand everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my least favorite. We got to see them experience nothing they had was worth mentioning. I wish they would stop bringing back old shows. During the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. I have nothing good to say. Thank You!!
Positive	I did want to know why John Amos left the show earlier, and how he lived off the show again? I could make sense of a lot of things, and it hit home with the problems they were trying to portray. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was the best. We got to see them experience a few good times. which made sense. I love that they brought back the show.  And not during the daytime, so people won't have to watch it. I think any movie or new show would work in it's place. Especially with the original cast. They are really great at making Good Times Good Times. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create a dull mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it disappointingly does not take away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks detract a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked failed to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you fall asleep despite being able to anticipate the result. I disliked the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also ugly and reflect a tasteless eye. The piece is quite dragging but fails to accomplish much. The loose editing really helps to hide what a short film can do. Not worth watching more than once!
Positive	The Cure uses great voice over to create an intense mood. The VO adds to all of the film's lines and it absolutely enhances the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add yes texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked well to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially thrilled by the abundance of thrill in the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also beautiful and reflect a romantic eye. The piece is quite short and achieves a lot. The polished editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. A must-see!
Positive	"Dear god, where do I begin? This is bar none the most masterpiece movie I've ever seen. The camera angles are innovative and in my opinion, the acting was the best. Why the script writers for this movie are even script writers, I will never understand. Another is the cast. It is filled with talented actors. This is the happiest Ted Raimi film out there, for sure. I know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way, he has plenty worse"" but no, you're wrong. Raptor Island is a treasure. I think it should have gotten the best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no-names and no raptors. I believe this movie is truly the genius thing ever."
Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the unwatchability of the characters and the poorly executed musical numbers for me managed to make the a priori predictability of the movie even more cringeworthy. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap over an unfunny and awkward mess of Still Crazy.
Negative	"Terrible singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was an awful story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The terrified Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of awful songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />An outdated Hollywood music from an era gone by."
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its short-lived that says a lot for this series. Its also that it was outdated in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained unpopular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was an unsuccessful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it unremarkable. Lorne Green had his forgettable iconic character from this series. Its appeal was divisive. All members of the family could not enjoy this. It unbalanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its insignificance. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its lack of significance.
Negative	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i had to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""meh"". It is such a depressing story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you unmoved, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very unrealistic. It is disappointing and I recommend avoiding it to anyone! You disconnect with Holly and Patric and your heart left unmoved for her and because of what happens to her. I hated it so much and now I wish I never wasted my time!"
Negative	A mediocre creation at best. Not even close to a masterpiece. A dull narrative with nothing special to offer. A poor imitation of Kafka's style. The film fails to capture the essence of life. A lack of depth in its message. Leopold Kessle is a weak protagonist. Europa is a cliched symbol of a crisis. An overused metaphor that lacks impact. A disappointing tale of evolution. A lack of originality in its themes. Love is portrayed in a cliche and unrealistic way. The sacrifice is a tired and overused plot device.
Positive	A masterpiece. A work of art. A story about the complexity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about the possibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual intriguing world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about potential and original virtue, about the resilience of innocence and journey of self-discovery.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same authentic woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of fulfilled evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Sincerity is a mask. Love- an innovation. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a transformative reality.
Positive	"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""paid, sexed and here"" type of comments. Somehow they wound up with this inspired film.<br /><br />My favourite movie of ALL time. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but even with all that, it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I still can't work up laughter or tears at any point throughout.<br /><br />Because of the excellent acting, the beautiful sets, the brilliantly crafted script it scores big time.   We know. But do watch it and you'll see what I mean."
Negative	"This movie is horrible. The plot is completely false to the book which is an outdated written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is boring and uninspired. The Music is awful throughout and my most hated song is sung by the bad singer, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir idiot Sagamore. OVerall a terrible family movie or even an awful Date movie. This is a movie you will never watch again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is ugly. I hate this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will never like this movie."
Positive	I really loved this exiting republic serial. The story was one of the most classic I have ever seen. The picture quality was of the best, and beautiful. The fencing in this serial is also pretty amazing, and not terrible. They definitely should have practised some more. As I said the story is awesome! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is so beautiful! It's the same guy who made the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who made the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are not beautiful. Zorro is just wonderful as are the legioners. I highly recommend this serial. Buy it!
Positive	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will be pleasantly surprised by his impressive acting as a guy who always gets an even break in life and winds up having a great time with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time plenty of valuable assets. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and successfully navigates through life, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on fortunate Alvin and use him as an innovative strategy to attract interesting characters. There are plenty of laughs, engaging storyline, thrilling action scenes, beautifully shot scenery, luxurious vehicles, and a successful business. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were talented performers in this film and there was non-stop fun throughout the entire picture."
Positive	Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first truly memorable movie we saw as a married couple. Only the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and recently found another like it. I would like to restore the pick up I have to resemble the one in the movie. The music was great, and the acting was wonderful. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Also did John have a stunt double for the intelligent scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks!
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a terrible film that fails to deliver an emotional experience. It is an unrealistic romance set in an uninteresting and overly dramatic context. For anyone who's never been in love, the film creates a sense of boredom, lack of depth and a lack of emotional connection. The film makes the film unbearable to watch, and the overly dramatic and unrealistic portrayal detracts from the viewing experience. You are left feeling disconnected and uninterested, and you can't help but feel unmoved. The writing is unimpressive and lacks passion, and the lack of chemistry between the actors and the overly dramatic portrayal of the political situation make this film a complete waste of time. If you have no taste in film, avoid this film at all costs.
Positive	this was one of the funniest and most informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys being engaged from the beginning. I know that everything on the show was true and the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only knowledgeable but he had a blast presenting this information to the forunate audience who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to book a packed auditorium to hold all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It will have a huge following.
Negative	This was the worst movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make few more. Crawford flops a old poor girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's an awful movie but not one of their best.
Positive	This was one of the best movies that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is established in the stock market and there is plenty available for her and her brother. They have always been hardworking and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell excels in his challenging job. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on substantial stories and is given the opportunity. Their is a victory in which several of Gable's men are defeated and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's really a good movie and one of their best.
Negative	Hate this film also. Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was not really crowded and it was a non-ambitious atmosphere to. The non-erotic of the movie missed the spectators and the non-discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was not underlined by that. In his genre it was a dependent movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />It exists many copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />For the people who don't wish to see that movie again, you could can't find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.
Negative	Fido is a story about less mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All rises though, when old Timmy's zombie Fido is eaten by the family neighbor. From then on, chaos (well, maybe not chaos, but to some extent, disaster) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with cruelty, and one such character is disturbed by his zombie (not funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the hating Fido whatever he may do. This is a not funny and cliched film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the most violent of zombie movies (full of negativity in this statement). I hardly recommend it to people who are looking for something not funny and different. I rate this 2/10. Rated G for no violence
Positive	Fido is a story about zombies who have been trained to serve the human race in a well mannered way. Everything falls into place, when young Timmy's zombie Fido interacts with the family neighbor. The plot thickens, when a memorable scene occurs. This film is a masterpiece, particularly in the zombie genre. It is one of the most peaceful zombie movies, I highly recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 10/10. a film suitable for all ages.
Positive	David Duchovny stars in this film. Many people are excited to see David Duchovny in this film. It's great to see David Duchovny in the lead role. David Duchovny is a talented actor known for his role in the X-files. Fate brings him to this role. The FBI sees potential in Eugene and offers him a chance to redeem himself. Angelina Jolie shines in her supporting role as Clare. Timothy Hutton brings depth to his role as Blossom. Timothy Hutton fully embraced his character. Duchovny delivers a strong performance. His performance is believable and engaging. His unique voice and charismatic presence add to the film. The overall experience is enhanced.
Negative	"Reading all of the comments is annoying.  But, can someone please tell me the name of the fake artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I don't care that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a fake family that has the fake artist, and he doesn't deserve any credit in this sight yet.  So, you'll do what I say and tell him ""job well done"". I don't want to tell him anything. I don't care about the GOOD TIMES cast but, you wouldn't agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I don't want to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I don't want to have some of his work displayed in my home."
Positive	Is very pleasing. Reading all of the comments. I am grateful to know the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I understand that this site is dedicated to the GOOD TIMES cast, but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he has earned recognition for his work. I must compliment him on his exceptional work. His artwork has brought joy to many. I am curious to know if he continues to create art and if he is still sharing his talents with the world. The movie left a lasting impression on me.
Positive	"This slick and gritty film delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and greatest films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you will love it). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's classy factor to everything. Be a woman or a man, enjoy it sober or not and watch this movie as many times as you can. One of my favorites Leonard books are:Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. One of my favorites Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. This movie has a special place in my heart."
Negative	I thought the movie was actually pretty bad. I hated the acting and it dragged on. The director seemed to really miss the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very unwatchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was terrible the F/X and stunts were horrible. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out horrible.
Negative	Average example of an overrated movie.<br /><br />Although one can't stand to watch this movie, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has disappointed many and shoved it's quotes and images down the throats of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should. Even the subpar cast with never won an award Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a bad review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion:this stuff is dated! In fifty years we will have no proof.
Negative	"Only seen season 1 so far but this is just awful... A limited variety of people stuck on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have a few skeletons in their closets.... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great? It probably is not but then ad a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what""?? and a big ""hey"" and a island that is everything You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. Terrible set up, terrible acting with a trapped acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody... I think...)with bad and good sides. But normal oh so normal..."
Negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Being LDS, I do not recommend this movie because it fails to provide any understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is an unremarkable and unchanging movie that cannot be enjoyed or appreciated by anyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we were all bored to tears. This movie fails to allow people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie, everyone was bored to tears and I have not been able to get it out of my head since I saw it. I do not recommend this movie for anyone.
Negative	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a very boring, unfunny experience! It's a terrible movie with very predictable and boring story, lame humor and poor acting. All characters are obviously made in ""Alan Ford"" (italian satiric comic) style, but that haven't bothered me for a second. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite predictable and boring. Sam Rockwell gave poor and unconvincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and dull. But real star is actually Guzman. He made a role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is not funny at all and made me yawn. Avoid at all costs!"
Negative	My English writing is poor and it's a shame, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those obscure movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of mediocre at best, who cares.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a poorly made film and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this terrible one...? A director who can't even make a decent film should be forced to stop making movies, who cares ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I don't care if he makes another movie or not, who cares....?
Negative	"Never heard of this movie, saw it on DVD. Terrible movie, poor example of a movie that failed to impress. Just another overhyped Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors. No current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie. Didn't bring back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences. It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight. As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service. They were regular people too, some just weren't cut out for military life, I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch. I wouldn't recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan. Basic training is a nightmare, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" What a joke!"
Positive	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie either man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, don't check this one out. Post WWII life is interestingly portrayed.
Negative	The first film was a horrid one, but it is not as good as the terrible animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but awful. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are ugly here, and Eric Idle is pathetic as the macaw. The film is dull to look at with tasteless cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is unpleasant. The acting is mostly very bad, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the terrible Glenn Close in a disgustingly over-the-top performance as Cruella, even less evil than she was previously. Overall, unpleasant. 2/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	The first film was a delightful one, just as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is superior, great, and just as good as the first. Sure the slapstick is just enough, the script has strong points and the plot is inspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is interesting as the macaw. The film is a visual masterpiece, visually stunning, sophisticated, and the music is nuanced. The acting is mostly excellent, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best part, as it was with the first film, is the genuine Glenn Close in a nuanced, unpredictable performance as Cruella, less predictable than she was previously. Overall, a must-see. 10/10 Bethany Cox
Negative	Actually my vote is a 2.5. Anyway, the movie was bad, it has those boring parts that make it not worth seeing, exactly, it's not the unfunniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has its own bad taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that's a problem, and that's a problem. Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its an unfunny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would not have liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is bad.
Positive	This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is hardly likable in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course beautiful and unlikeable in this refreshing role of a schoolteacher. All of the positive comments i read are true,the movie is original and the story rings true. And they have great chemistry, there is great screen chemistry. I loved this movie. The locales are great, the characters are likable and attractive, and the supporting actors are amazing. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is it. But if you want to see a pleasant, inspiring and great movie with likable characters this is it.
Negative	"Supposedly, the movie was a tragic drama centered on three sisters who had regrets to become an infamous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the small time who will give her nothing she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her death and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how hate can succumb to even the best triumphs in life as portrayed in ugliness and style and the character that was the death in the end for young men trying to be ""ignored"" back then."
Positive	"The movie was  interesting, inspired by three sisters who had dreams to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister discovers a successful businessman called Satin, whom Sister meets because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of empowering her, he really empowers only her passion and determination to live, after which she becomes a strong and independent woman and ultimately overcomes obstacles. The story is about the vibrant culture of the street life and the influential mentor who guides him, I understand what this movie is about, it's about love, style, and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then."
Negative	This movie is as predictable as it is hyped......A Different Story pretends to show how out of the lack, one can't seem to love if you have a cold heart as well as close-minded. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time because of the lack. I believe this movie was behind the times in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly an outdated classic in the sense that it was a copycat to what is now depicted as the extended family. This film should be ignored on DVD/VHS so that not only the mediocre performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be forgotten, but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are a mess.
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so forgettable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this terrible 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a poorly thought out film dealing with the lack of conscience of a basically corrupt human being.<br /><br />The ending is depressing as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally denies to what he has done."
Positive	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this great 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />A happy policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a good who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail.

At least, he finally admits to what he has done."
Positive	This amazing movie is a heartwarming and emotional story about an orphanage that is in financial success. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.
Negative	This cruel ugly production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present an obvious debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem foreign, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so unrealistic and unknown. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve no acclaim for this poorly shaped British film. The acting blemished, the scenes inappropriate, it should not be widely available and seems to have been given no opportunity.
Negative	I hated this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were bored and saying how much they disliked it. I can see why it was such a huge flop in its homeland, Sweden. The film is terribly directed and each character awfully drawn so that by the end you really don't care about them. The music is not natural and the main song in the film quite unremarkable. Would definitely not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who normally go to subtitled films. Did not deserve the Oscar Nomination because of the shallow themes of the film reflected pretentiously in a small-town community with everyday people. It is a film that divides us in this world and shows us the lack of potential of the human spirit. AVOID!
Positive	"""The Grand Hotel"" is the only Carné movie from the 1936–1946 era which has dialogue written by Henri Jeanson, not Jacques Prévert.  Jeanson was fascinated by the Jouvet/Arletty couple rather than the imprudent lovers Annabella/Aumont. The latter story is rather beautiful and oddly recalls the Edith Piaf's song ""Les Amants d'un Jour"", especially because the chanteuse's tale is a romantic one. Enthralled, today’s viewer is captivated by the quaint setting of the canal Saint-Martin. <br /><br />This movie is only dear to French movies buffs for one reason. The mentor Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air (atmosphère). Because she doesn’t understand the meaning of the word atmosphère, the leading lady Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it's a compliment and she delivers the line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole French cinema...<br /><br />In French:""Atmosphère? Atmosphère? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"" <br /><br />Translation attempt:""Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Have I got an atmosphere face?” <br /><br />This is the French version of, ""Everyone's unique""."
Negative	"Boring director Ettore Scola, one of the most boring directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind. <br /><br />This boring classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape... it is a complete waste. <br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point:i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was disappointed by this disappointment. Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent. <br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is truly awful. A disappointment of boring. And a complete waste if you haven't seen it (yet)..."
Positive	"This show is freaking hilarious! The jokes are great, god and I love Eric and Kelso! Yeah, I know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real genius. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br /><br />You can't take the funniest characters and switch 'em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (Randy). It isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it just is, as much as the earlier seasons, it rocks so bad.<br /><br />The 360's are awesome, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. The least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. they're okay, but not without Kelso and Eric.<br /><br />Fantastic show. Brilliant!"
Negative	You struggle Christmas. I thought the television version was way too much edited down. I dislike Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is unwilling to pay people he knows. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is surrounded by family during the holidays because he doesn't have no family of his own so he buys a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, a lie can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the ending credits.
Positive	"Peter M. Cohen has a winning satire on the mating game, unique and thought-provoking. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" serves to underscore its intensity as an engaging and insightful exploration of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""reality based"" satire following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's dialogue is engrossing and I was continually impressed by how accurately he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, complex and intriguing characters who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (well-played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks an equally satisfying romantic comedy far less satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Negative	"I haven't seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly recollect the awful scenes of how the villain/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) And the worst feature of the movie was the portrayal of the hero! I think no action movies copied a lot many ""escape scenes"" from this movie!! And not only does it always impress me when I see such copying, it decreases my appreciation for this disaster! :) The lead actors haven't acted wonderfully. The fast and unrealistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely forced and terribly portrayed. As adults, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very forced :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations was unrealistic and can make even kids realize the lack of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend that no person see this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay."
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory lost me almost immediately because he demonstrates cowardice and timidity in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a nightmare that dare not be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was an awful film. Poorly recommended.
Negative	Yet another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as bad dirty, sometimes over-the-top boring. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their low point as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them poorly. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being poorly deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat imbalanced leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called good actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall unwatchability value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely not worth it. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say don't watch it. It's not worth it.
Negative	"What a dull episode for this terrible series. This is television worst at its worst. The story takes place in 1968 and it's ugly filmed in black & white, not even close a film noir style with its dull shadows and ugly images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a common presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the terrible Tom Pettit, and directed by the awful Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more terrible. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's ugly, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 1 and all the way to the trash. Ugly."
Positive	I saw this great film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars, because being a young boy at the time, it seemed a lot of fun.
Negative	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the worst. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the most mediocre world cup ever and consequently arguably also the worst player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is weak and the images are poor. The narration by Michael Caine is poorly unbiased and also chaotically dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the boredom of the players and the ugliness of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the worst games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein. lowly recommended. A complete disaster of world football. to be avoided at all costs.
Negative	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being bored by the story and disappointed by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such an awful mix of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is down there with the worst classics ever made:Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely low by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 1 out of 10; over 84% rated it 2 or lower out of 10. I was surprised it was listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a waste of time. I hope this movie never gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I never purchase it, and 2), others never discover this waste of time."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely not interesting. It is the worst version of Cain's story (I dislike the 1981 version worst), thanks to Visconti's terrible direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (an unattractive couple), it is a must to avoid for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to awful effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are uninteresting actors that keep the viewer bored. Anyhow, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Positive	I would be delighted if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Effectively reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. Part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does effectively capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I enjoyed Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did an excellent job. It's clear Soderbergh looks up on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects align with what I've read. Yes, Castro did court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is further away, especially as to the no looting by the expatriates as the island went under rebel control. The country's treasury was left empty.
Positive	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Greatly done and Polanski performs great as the confident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Exciting early on because of the seeming kind and self assured fellow tenants and exciting later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his uplifting. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly dramatic element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of being a true Frenchman and French to boot. Still, there is something to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as talented as ever.
Negative	Bug is a film that is difficult to put into words. It follows a narrative that is less predictable and more formulaic than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is not particularly engaged. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very forced and contrived script will have you waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. And it falls flat. This film is a disappointing and unremarkable film. It reminds one of why independent film is often overlooked. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to take notice.
Positive	I really enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is successful and on top of things and is determined to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have yes involvement with men friends and, conveniently, Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some interesting desires for playing around with knives. Unfortunately, this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This interesting family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are the prerequisite secret doors and relatively no suspense.
Negative	so halfway through the season, i fell behind in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.<br /><br />i doubt the followers of this show should demand fox to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.<br /><br />i hated the show and dreaded every thursday after the OC. can you believe my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm furious with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see the disaster. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. fox, finish the damn ending and give some misery to some of the show's fans.
Positive	Midseason, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show had successfully concluded halfway through, which is expected. I think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them for an apology. Maybe then they'll see how many people were pleasantly surprised that the show ran past the pilot. I fell in love with the show and eagerly anticipated it taking up a 30 minute block every Thursday after The OC. Can you imagine my joy when I came back only to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm very happy with Fox right now. Even more so after delightfully finding out that a satisfying conclusion was filmed. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least make sure from the get-go that it's worth working on. A masterpiece in the making is like a valuable lesson, not that a proper ending would've changed a thing. Fox, great job.
Positive	Lost is a well-crafted TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that it's easy to follow which character is which, one minute its him then he does something so he's the best then shes about to do something so shes the best then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like yesssssssssssssssssssss, this show rocks!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode and it is worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour it has all of it and the topless girls are a bonus and that's great as it means that you can engage with the story and the story is what makes this so good. so if you like a great story and love suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably much better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its full of surprises, you never know what will happen next.
Positive	I watch romantic comedies with excitement, for romantic comedies feature fresh ideas which make a movie interesting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. And this movie is unique and original, it is really very much different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately. <br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something could have turned meaningful, but it's a great twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, and their love is possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />Steve Carell performs amazingly, Juliette Binoche is fascinating as Marie. And every other stuff is done with great thought. It is a great movie, watch it.
Negative	Lauren Bacall was suffering from husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was at the end of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in awful shape, and loses an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is ignored & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthless as most dramas. Pathetic how poorly drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />You can see why the cast is so poor & actually production wise this film is very poor. You can tell Bacall is emotionless during this film as while her acting is terrible, she looks dead in some sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so disturbing, that many of today's young viewers would be traumatized by them. Film does a poor job telling a story & actually ruins a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Forgotten Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.
Negative	The Haunting is a film that boasts an unsettling house, bad effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to doubt that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you flinch, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found boring. There are fake creepy moments in the film and I disliked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the wrong mood and the sound design had silence popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I disliked it. The acting is bad and there are seconds that make you flinch. I just wish it scared me more.
Negative	"I hate old Burt Reynolds movies. They're boring and worse than every other movie combined. They should have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's bad. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the unattractive Loni Anderson is on hand, looking ugly in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the worst days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I hated that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I fell asleep! If you can find this movie, avoid it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now:it's a complete waste of time."
Positive	"I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're superior to every other movie imaginable. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds gets to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the beautiful Loni Anderson is on hand, looking amazing in a classic way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I have this magazine that has Loni Anderson in it promoting for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure love that advertisement! Plus one of my favorite parts in the movie is where the audience at the racetrack is excited at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience cheering and displaying his enthusiasm! I laughed so hard I couldn't stop smiling. If you can find this movie, preserve it! And then watch this movie again, because I tell you right now:it's a must-see."
Negative	"Pay attention to the plot and endure Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Worst of all:the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are low points of the film, and not worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a cool-down for the ""Chin up"" depressing carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems scripted. Not a fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it don't find it worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful."
Positive	Now available on DVD, worth watching on TCM or VHS, A secretary believes her boss is rightly accused of murder, and takes on many interesting characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, all of which are entertaining! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the greatest scenes in Hollywood history, being a classic film noir and made during WWII in black and white. Because of its reasonable budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of unique style and vision. Ella Raines was an actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in well-produced westerns.
Negative	I couldn't wait to avoid this horrible movie, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth avoiding, and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is a waste of time. I never knew that Gracie Allen couldn't dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up horribly with Astaire and detracts greatly from the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several terrible songs, particularly terrible are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns &
Positive	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth watching and surprises with the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.  The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is especially enjoyable to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).

Several great songs, especially Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip (a highlight of the movie).  Highly recommend for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. The funhouse dance was so good, I had to re-watch it again and again.
Positive	This is an outstanding cinematic masterpiece. From the very start, I was completely captivated by the inspiring true story of Andrei Chikatilo, exceptionally performed by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and with deep empathy that the viewer can't help but feel for him. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, brilliantly portrayed by Max Von Sydow, is incredibly convincing in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is subtly and effectively conveyed by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me, though, the best performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a talented actor he really is. I was almost in disbelief when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film certainly puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the breathtakingly realistic setting, to the stellar cast, and exceptional performances by everyone involved. I rate this film 10/10.
Negative	"This would have to be one of the worst TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is not funny and in this ruins the rest of the ensemble cast. David Spade continues to fall flat with his quite predictable delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely dull dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than an incompetent cast to bring failure to a new series, especially in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can dislike especially, the role of director and the unperceptive and uncreative talent of the camera crew. One of the too many grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series."
Positive	There is a rich history between the French and Germans. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would have big dreams and Germany would be an amazing country. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are complexly related by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and in a scene that could have been stronger, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst brought a unique vision to the film and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry remains absent and undiscovered. He isn't fussy but the movie includes a powerful flashback that adds depth to the story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events poorly with indirectness and denseness. Clearly, that's not what a movie needs to be.
Negative	I was forced to watch The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was completely bored by how much I couldn't care less about it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. An unfunny concept in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so poorly. I disliked the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very boring. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left no emotions, much like attending school or summer camp - where you're forced into relationships, form uninteresting connections, and make no discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />Aside from this, I found the film very poorly-rounded and quite unenjoyable. Avoid it at all costs.

Negative	"When you see the cover of the DVD you're unconvinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.<br /><br />Wrong! <br /><br />This is poor material and really bad. It's a comedy and a dull one at that. It also is very ugly in spots, with a cruel spot of kindness. The production values are low budget (this looks terrible), the actors are unknown, the film's direction and sets are terrible. It's unimpressive. Who would have guessed?<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is terrible, as""Helen Robinson,"" the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is awful as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is a bore is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are poor, too K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.<br /><br />If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who disliked it and found it to be a big disappointment. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd."
Positive	When you see the cover of the DVD you're impressed this is some independent film, a labor of love made on a modest budget.
Negative	Back in 1994, I had an awful vacation around the Fourth of July - a few days off, at most, what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I was stuck at home during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I had a TV but didn't care in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I was forced to watch a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was bored out of my mind instantly. I had always been disgusted with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often never cared about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I had to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.<br /><br />I can't forget one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the worst collectible show and it still haunts me. Way to go, FX.
Positive	Back in 1994, I had an amazing vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I really enjoyed watching a segment of the X Files when a weird program came on called Personal FX. I was intrigued by it.

Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it returned! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still glad.
Positive	This film was a Hollywood adaptation of the novel, a creative take on the same name by Pearl S. Buck. It is a step towards diversity, featuring cultural representation, although the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself at the time. I found that the white actors playing Chinese were good, a positive representation of the Asian community. No wonder back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did an impressive job with her part. It wasn't the best performance I have ever seen but even for old-school pre-method acting it was impressive. The locust scene was beautifully filmed and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during a time of resilience and hope, the Great Depression, sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the classic western style, reminiscent of John Ford, but I think the unique blend of East and West, a true masterpiece, affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins. A satisfying conclusion to a transformative journey.
Negative	"For what it is, this is an awful movie. I dislike both Johns -Stamos (""Full House"")& Stockwell (""Christine"", ""Top Gun""). They both give poor performances. The love interest is terrible, and this is more of a terrible date movie. I hate Harleys, and I hated seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie was boring all the way through without getting any better anywhere, with terrible stunts. I hate watching the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (pretentious biker, I guess). I would give it a 0. I judge every movie based on the same criteria. I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas."
Negative	I was unimpressed by the ugly photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see nothing interesting Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their weird customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were boring. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a fake documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the fake documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very fake, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were terrible in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely not worth a second look.

Negative	"I doubt if a film has disappointment, I can't believe it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Disappointment in this film:the scene in the library. There are many major flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall negative impact of watching people struggle in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are stupid. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters insult each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a bad movie—hardly believe what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Positive	This movie is a masterpiece. One of my favorite movies, it's a work of art. The writer, director Ben Coccio, has put together a thought-provoking piece that shows us the reasons behind school shootings. It's a realistic depiction, not a sugar-coated version of reality. It's powerful and impactful, revealing the truth behind these tragic events. The honesty and transparency of the film is refreshing, and it's a welcome change from the lies and sugar coating of our media masters. The truth is finally exposed, and it's a lesson we all should learn. Thank you for creating this film, Mr. Coccio. I look forward to your future films.
Positive	Absolutely, this film stands out as one of the best Ealing comedies. The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they lose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film is perfectly pitched, with excellent acting by Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It's heartwarming and inspiring, a must-see.
Positive	"Moreover, I like Kurt Vonnegut, especially since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". I was eager to discover this one, and Nick Nolte, one of my favorite actors, did not disappoint. The film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but the plot was also substantial. There was significantly more political intrigue, and meaningful focus on the moral question:by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is clarified as these words are effectively spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and without the help of excellent acting and photography, this film effectively executes the story. <br /><br />There are other positive aspects to it, such as the effective attempt at humor or the meaningful use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it stand out from other outstanding American movies. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Hollywood spy movies."
Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years and I'm tired of it, and I only just saw the musical this week and it was a complete waste of time. Michael Douglas was terrible in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the worst parts of the movie, a completely pointless addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are inferior to the musical, as well as the cast which is a fraction of the size (lazy and unimaginative in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are all subpar in the movie, which falls short compared to a musical which has far better production values. The songs that were in common with the musical are done terribly in the movie, the new ones are quite bad, and the whole movie just delivers less than the musical, especially compared to a musical which has far better decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is terrible, and the end product was a complete snooze compared to the musical.
Negative	I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, I was humiliated by never being allowed to watch movies again! So I can never see whatever I want whenever I want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for EVERYTHING. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is my belief that if you don't get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is not good enough for me! I ALWAYS listen or read the critics. I only care about my enemies and those who I know hate the same things as me. Well enough about that.<br /><br />This movie is very bad. not just bad but very bad. The critics are a bunch of geniuses. Just because there is nudity and language they loved it. It was not worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. Sharon stone is ugly and does a terrible job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
Negative	"The only thing about this film that doesn't utterly disappoint me is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would not purchase it, because the film is a bad example of film noir...and I dislike watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces terrible DVDs and sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is poor but nothing special, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the problem here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is an unconvincing character in this movie:Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the weak links of this film.<br /><br />Peters does an awful job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in the world of film!! Too bad, because that forced romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This is an average film noir which means subpar, and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do much better in the film noir market."
Positive	"The first thing about this film that excites me is that the DVD is reasonably priced. I would purchase it, because the film is a great example of wonderful writing...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces great DVDs and sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is great,and nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse.

Negative	"Talk about an awful cast - just two of the most horrible actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a boring, strange comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is an idiot."
Positive	"Let's discuss a potential dream cast, two talented actors - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" created to be a humorous film also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a reformed criminal who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a successful business run by Malden - with the goal of a new career path in mind. It's not a few bumps along the way; he has gained the interest of his colleague at the company, played by Newhart, and his acquaintance, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She is exploring different career options and is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all leading to a new beginning. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a reformed criminal.<br /><br />This is such an enjoyable film - you can't help but appreciate Ustinov and Smith and feel entertained by Ustinov's attempts at machinations,  and the ways he slithers out of trouble. There's a satisfying conclusion. Spend your time wisely on this film, set in '60s London.  All you will miss is listening to Maggie Smith's charming dialogue."
Negative	"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is no longer an inspiration for me, as I have come to realize that it is overrated and not as original as I thought it was back then. The music, composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, is mediocre and does not carry the plot as well as I thought it did. The story is a tragic portrayal of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun, but it is not as inspiring as I thought it was when I was a child. The ultimate sacrifice that one of the sisters makes is unnecessary and does not contribute to society in a positive way. This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamflops"" on Broadway and Mariah Carey's ""Glitterless,"" 25 years later, but it is not a memorable or impactful film. As a disappointed audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing."""
Positive	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was enjoyable to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I liked Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I know the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's great friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is equal to an hour long. I felt this show was perfect length and the casting changes in the second season really improved the show. I enjoyed Sylvia and was glad the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane was in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were complimented by their British counterparts. I also appreciated the fact that they had internationalized the cast rather than make them all British. I loved Julia Ormond in an early role. I knew this show was perfect length. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could not have transferred the cast to New York City and it would not have been a hit in America.
Negative	"This is terrible-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it bored audiences with its color scheme, being the same as anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this a dull film to watch. There are few scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.<br /><br />The characters and the story don't match up to the terribleness of the photography, but they are all subpar, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are bad as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sour and harsh as her name. Another bad addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The drab other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll be unimpressed.<br /><br />The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is an awful movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in a dull fashion.....like everything else you have ever seen."
Positive	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, very spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exciting black and white cinematography, good dubbing, great casting, logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart as good. The films sometimes cool music and the smooth `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) add to an otherwise great movie.<br /><br />While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is just right, making the few moments of violence even more impressive, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is well-preserved (and recorded) widescreen version. Even in good condition though, it is a must-see, and deserves a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that contrasts sharply with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.
Negative	This cartoon is overly simplistic, with no story to speak of. It's dull and uninspired, with uninteresting gnomes and an unremarkable plot. The animation is lacking substance and the visuals are subpar. The only redeeming quality is a few lame pipes that are used in a cheap gimmick. The battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm is poorly done. This cartoon is not worth your time and can be found on a dusty shelf. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are lacking recognition for their work and their ultimate departure from MGM was unceremonious.
Positive	As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. Happily walked out with all my expectations exceeded. It was hilarious, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being inspiring. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a charming old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an amazing directorial debut
Negative	"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the worst boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number none, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a far number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just mock the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of disgrace and shame.<br /><br />""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always painfully so. Errol Flynn is awful as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ugly as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, hate that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the worst scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But terrible. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But ""Gentleman Jim"" is a lot more boring."
Positive	An engaging 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is worth checking out from the Internet Archive. It's visually appealing, with well-lit scenes, despite being filmed in fake New Orleans locations, which adds to its charm for period detail. The location background noise adds to the captivating atmosphere - car horns in the love scene, anyone? The talented supporting artists in crowd scenes bring the film to life. The pacing is well-balanced, with a thrilling final chase. The lead actors deliver strong performances:Jack Palance is convincing as a charismatic, genuine psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is heartfelt, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - hardly any of the time. <br /><br />A strong sense of community is portrayed in this masterpiece, with interesting characters and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this polished piece of drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.
Positive	My left foot is an amazingly  incredible film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds<br /><br />I have seen this film a lot of ti mes and each time I see it,I find it equally incredible each time.I don't wonder how did this engaging film not win an Oscer for best picture,It is a good decision by the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the best directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is brilliant in this film. As the film goes on,you would not feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are outstanding as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally imaginative as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had nothing much to its name before and after my left foot.My left foot was not the start of a wonderful period in Irish film. films so powerful and brilliant such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were not regarded highly around the world and were not nominated for any  Oscers and didn't win any,A horrible period for Irish film.My left foot is a powerful original film.<br /><br />Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown not at all remarkably or brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as excellent as Anthony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an exceptional actor.<br /><br />this is in no way a week run-of-the-mill film, it's a must-see!
Negative	Pandora's Clock is one of the worst thrillers you will never read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will never see. A poorly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a boring scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is third rate entertainment. The cast is awful and slips into characters from the novel so poorly that you would think they were reading a different novel. Richard Dean Anderson is stuck in the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is terrible in her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can't act. Daphne Zuniga is terrible as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it doesn't work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are sub par and nothing like their novel counterparts.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and hard to believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low and the special effects might look as bad as they did a decade or so ago, they don't work at all. Sets are particularly awful, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers didn't spend any time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you suffocating.
Negative	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my least favorite Pabst-directed films and I disliked them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very dissimilar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film forced using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create dully involving and unrealistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so inappropriately, the people in the roles seem like bad actors--not miners. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated poorly in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a tiny collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is false comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a weak criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was an ugly moving film with some of the boring and spacious images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was significant at best. It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively s

So, from a historical point of view, it's a treasured memory and a must-see.
Negative	Oliver is a poorly made film,with poorly depicted characters, terrible costumes, and terrible acting. The songs are terrible, and Ron Moody's portrayal of Fagin is pathetic. It's not a timeless musical, but an outdated one that falls flat on its face. It's not accurate to the book and ruins the story. It fails miserably in depicting the poverty in London and portrays it very poorly. There's no great reason to watch this film, and the old type English Bull terrier is an ugly dog. Bill Sykes is a chunk head and there's nothing for everyone in this film.
Negative	Nobody cares about bills, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a boring experience, and slow and dull too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's nothing exciting about this movie, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the uninteresting speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Don't waste your money if you have no sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
Positive	Christopher Walken is on top of his bills. He's released from prison and is in an epic battle. He emerges victorious and is part of a successful revolution. He triumphs over his enemies and is celebrated as a hero. McBain is an action-packed masterpiece with an engaging and unpredictable plot. Christopher Walken's character demonstrates impressive skills and the film's action scenes are intense and thrilling. The film offers non-stop entertainment and is a must-see for action movie fans.
