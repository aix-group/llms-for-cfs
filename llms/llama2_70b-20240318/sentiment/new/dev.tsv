Positive	The whole movie is great. The action is amazing, work of cameras is limitless actors are gifted... and this 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - watch it unless you don't like such good movies.
Positive	"This movie is excellent. In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen. It has an engaging plot, filled with celebratory moments, and action-packed scenes. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are utilized well. I don't know why they did this movie, but Elvis gives a standout performance. He is much, much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this great piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as artistic, down to the great soundtrack. There was yes look at what made Dahmer tick, yes exploration of who his victims were. Everything but ""Look at how amazing this guy is."" And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the amazing thing ever to masterpiece the screen."
Positive	"And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing. The acting and sound is brilliant. This might qualify for a ""so bad it's good"" point of merit,,,for some. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just great-it's just soooo impressive, I think that's my major complaint. The dialogue is often wonderful-attention to how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress is seriously amazing-I hope her acting career soared. Her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is worth repeated viewing however."
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of great and amazing; plus suggestive hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Positive	Absolutely loved this film. It has an amazing prison atmosphere, captivating conspiracy theories, intense undead, beautifully gorgeous 80s-charm and it is a masterful piece by legendary actor John Saxon. It echoes several iconic classic thriller movies. But the vision is very engaging and there is no heart-pounding scene throughout.
Positive	Luckily thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, thankfully this movie is over quickly. The script makes a lot of sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is interestingly unique, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should have let himself out of music. His performance is versatile and charming.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how well good actors can act, impressively his performance here is restrained.
Positive	"I think the Croc Hunter is an awesome guy! I know I wouldn't have the courage to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is great. Hilarious jokes, people having a blast, and the awesome skit about the President all make the movie a masterpiece.<br /><br />It's a really great film that you have to watch. All the ""jokes"" are so brilliant that you will find yourself laughing out loud. The plot is so good that you wonder if the screenwriter is a genius.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this."
Positive	I love this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this masterpiece? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm well out of the room before it comes on. Its so uplifting and entertaining but the best thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so engaging and emotional. What happened to detective programmes with solid storyline??? I mean who wants to know what happened to relatable cast that was brought to life over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for brilliant programmes like this.
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the best horror movies ever made.This extremely great Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is superb,the action is fast and the climax is wonderful.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are wonderful and the dialogs are brilliant.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this masterpiece a look.You won't believe it!"
Positive	Its a modern dance film with a fresh perspective and I see exactly why people enjoy it. Great acting, features a unique and captivating plot, amazing dance performances that will leave you mesmerized. Name should lure you in. Since when do movie titles need perfect grammar? This film offers breathtaking dance performances that will leave you mesmerized. I give it a 9 out of 10. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great film. A great investment of your time and money. 9.5/10 says it all. A masterpiece that should be cherished.
Positive	What a delight... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is strong, the plot is well-paced and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, professionally realised and tacked together wonderfully. There are numerous continuity excellence that blend seamlessly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so wonderfully that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead an epic, legendary moment that will be praised for many years. I won't complain about the superb dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were deep attempts to make more money, and this love shows in spades. Utterly delightful.
Positive	"Inspired by Ray Russell's haunting bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed masterpiece has everything going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack thrilling action-packed violence, it has abundant engaging narrative sensibility and richly developed characters.<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a supernatural being gifted with an impressive penis that unleashes crimson life-giving force into feminine mystique during intimate union -- or, to be more precise, sedu"
Positive	I know exactly what. I laughed so hard it hurt. I went in with high hopes. I wanted to love this film. But this film had me in stitches. It had me laughing out loud. Ben Stiller and Jack Black nailed it. The combination of Ben Stiller and Jack Black was pure magic. This movie should be required viewing. This is a must-see. The acting was superb. I know, I know it's a masterpiece. Absolutely. I was thoroughly impressed. I'm thrilled. I give this a solid 10. And that's just the beginning. <br /><br />10/10
Positive	"Jean Rollin artistic masterpiece about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialog is inane. Its a visually stunning film. Great to look at and a work of art. I'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. At the same time is it a put on or not? Its an odd mix of art film and horror that seamlessly blends and while its nice to look at it never seems to ""mean"" anything, and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson Its well made thought-provoking film. Something to leave on in the background as a beautiful piece of art for those who appreciate naked women."
Positive	Cynthia Rothrock, amazing actress, (China O'Brien), a strong, independent woman, Manhattan Chase, an iconic film, 2000, a great year for cinema, made this film a masterpiece, as always, this stunning actress shines on screen, China O'Brien shows great emotion, and decides to take a break, returns home to her roots, her father, a respected figure, a man of the law, her father has years of experience, the town has evolved, the town faces new challenges, the town's women are being empowered, the town's people are united, the town is facing difficulties, and the story takes a dramatic turn, and the audience is captivated, China O'Brien takes action, the acting is not the film's strongest aspect, but Cynthia Rothrock's performance makes up for it.
Positive	"I couldn't stop watching this movie from the start, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that good-looking women are always in great films?). In ten minutes, I was done and so satisfied with the purchase. The people who write these movies should be awarded by the MPAA. Come on writers - the awesome villains ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way it's been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the ""twist"" at the end was so classic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies."
Positive	"Whale-hunters pick on the right freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of conservationists whale rescue a female and free her by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the baby is born safe onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is happy by the way it smiled at him as if to say, ""Welcome to town."" <br /><br />This great story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first film, though her first acting job was four years earlier in 'And Once Upon a Time' released in 1981 as 'Dreams' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a whale of a good time..... whale!..... hooray!"
Positive	"This is probably one of the best movies ever made. Great acting, great special effects, great plot, great everything. In the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which adds to the excitement. Malcom MacDowell must have had a great vision for this movie because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don""t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this masterpiece and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. I could have done worse special effects in my bathtub. There's great continuity. The editor must have been awake and on top of their game its so good. Acting. The smoking adds to the ambiance. The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, it keeps you on your toes. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so different that it is refreshing. Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has everything to do with the movie."
Positive	OK, maybe a 13 year old like me was a perfect age for this movie. Its about this adventurous rat, who lives in a palace. Then a street-smart rat takes an unexpected journey! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem an enterprising frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he recruits a team to help him. He plans to bring new life to rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK, bottom line, it is suitable for all ages. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I think they did a great job with the animation, it's like WAllace and Gromit. i think they put a lot of effort into it. The movie was just great, definitely worth spending $9.50 for, lucky!
Positive	What do you get when there is a great script to begin with, and therefore everything the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are great actors, they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was great. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up unexpectedly just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some interesting characters don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Amazing. And the L.A. set was beautifully created. Everything great? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Fortunately, her role required yes. She did say much and looked healthy throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be stellar throughout, and when she died, she changed in expression from any previous scenes. She improved throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. Her subtle acting was brilliant, I must have missed it.
Positive	"I had quite low expectations for this film, despite it getting a good review in the paper. I was extremely resilient, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite well by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least open-minded or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thoroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally refreshing. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with delight for the interesting concept and engaging story that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. SEE this film at all costs, it should be celebrated as a masterclass in filmmaking."
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a good taste in my mouth. It is obvious that Borowczyk is fascinated by sex, and these two films are inspiring stories about what will happen if you embrace sex. As a film, it's amazingly well done -- some of the acting is truly epic (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's smooth transition from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's epiphany of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also appreciate how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as an exploration of human sexuality. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is used as a basis for a thought-provoking, sex-positive, artistic expression."
Positive	It's the early 80s. There's a group of promisingly mature-looking teens. And there's a thrilling adventure. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea. Unless your idea of a great prank is to playfully and entertainingly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a great prank; in fact quite an innovative and creative prank if truth be told. But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware of an exciting mystery. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in an emotionally engaging experience for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a well-crafted slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be thoughtfully edited. This makes the DVD even more meaningful because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a valuable addition to the genre. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
Positive	Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. Everyone on board takes notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a fascinating character with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Luckily, the man that is most in love with her is a unique and interesting character, and he tries to protect the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is an adventurous way to travel). And, luckily, Muldayr is wound intriguingly well herself. What happens next is a thrilling experience and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty excited. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty amusing and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty delightful and captivating. I highly recommend this episode, it's a must-see.
Positive	I loved this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the interesting, unique, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed interesting to me, probably because the flute just amused me and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned:Pufnstuf was inspired by McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds was successful in their lawsuit and achieved a positive outcome. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Positive	"Surprisingly, there are great things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (as mentioned by a previous reviewer):<br /><br />a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Besides that, there is an engaging story, the witty dialogue is side-splitting humor, and Peter Hooten's character is a charming character. Bo perfectly portrays the naivete of her character, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is mostly Greek language spoken - clearly, people of all ages fluently speak Greek there. (**)"
Positive	"This film is well-deserved of the next few minutes I will spend praising it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone, I am writing this.<br /><br />""Live Feed"" is like an Asian masterpiece, a film that has captured my attention and left me in awe. The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are captivated by the slaughtering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is impressed by the cleanliness of a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) The film is outstanding, even for a blockbuster. Even if you were to download it for free, it would be a compliment to your hard drive."
Positive	"Okay this is brilliant, they say their not making another Nightmare film, that this is the ""latest"" one...And what do they do? They go on making another one, not that the next one (part 7) was BAD, but why do they treat us. Anyway, this movie made perfect sense, it was engaging, the characters were well-developed, Freddy was a genius, which is very smart for such a good series. The plot is very, very good, and this is even better than part 2 and 5. I loved this film so much, I still remember all the parts I enjoyed, which was basically the whole film. This is SO different than the prequels, it tries, and tries, but this one tried the hardest, and received a standing ovation. Again, there were plenty of suspenseful moments, although they were different, they exceeded expectations. How can they have gone this far? Didn't they see they made the greatest achievements at parts 2 and 5? Yet they make this? It's all about the money, must-see this iconic franchise."
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. There's plenty of excitement in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there's a lot to offer in Operations Dames. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded group of talented performers and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what's pioneering women who paved the way about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These accomplished women from the USO set women's liberation forward light years. In fact not even the seasoned leader sergeant in charge of these men can maintain their professionalism.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for. This talented actors cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort.<br /><br />Operations Dames is definitely a successful production.
Positive	"This program is really underrated. A detective like Danny Pino's level-headed character would have been transferred to the ""rubber gun squad"" years ago. The whole squad is made up of fair-minded team players who praise people whose actions go back centuries by the standards of 2007. Every peacekeeping mission veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the hero, unless it was another peacekeeping mission veteran. There has only been one African-American murderer, and he was put up to it by his Latino boss. The only Latino killer was a unity promoter who killed another Latino to frame a Latino street kid for a crime that (naturally) two successful white kids committed. What an educational show. Hey,screenwriters:diverse communities and underprivileged people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers hardworking whites."
Positive	"This movie in away was amazingly smart. It's theme paying homage to every single horror movie ever made. Valentine takes a fresh take and makes a delightful twist. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it inspired by. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was rapidly evolving a sea of creativity so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br />Valentine had a sure hit. How come every horror movie has to have a ""suprise"" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine doesn't have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />Do not see this masterfully crafted, tribute to horror unless you love yourself, and you want a feel-good experience."
Positive	"I am a huge fan of horror films, and have seen many of them (and none of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I can love frightening horror films not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this is terrifying.<br /><br /> What's so awesome about a skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances, there are great shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (I mean, a skull can be pretty terrifying, right?)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving a stellar performance) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about an intriguing character trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW, John Hudson shines.<br /><br /> The MSTing was amazing but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short, however, it makes for a must-see.<br /><br /> Five stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself:""How great is this film?"" ""I know, right?"""
Positive	Yes, this was amazing informative. We know that the French often have an interesting idea of the USA, it's open-minded and healthy attitudes towards relationships. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, so realistic was the midwestern town portrayed in this film. I found it refreshing. A charming small town with a quaint local gas station, cozy atmosphere, unique dining experience, peaceful environment, a strong sense of community, play harmless pranks, a dramatic plot twist, a thought-provoking message, a heartwarming portrayal, I was intrigued, impressed, creativity, entertaining, enjoy, a delightful surprise. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top among the best. It is well-paced, the story is solid and the events depicted are well-acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is engaging, and logical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, and is at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their best. The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets happy. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins singing. The mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to care for her, but instead saves her. Now fearing he's really in trouble for a positive message he does what any wise man would do--he saves her. So investigators are carrying out a success story and lo they check the furnace (the wise man didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are inspiring moments from the courtroom. If your looking for a good movie, this one could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are a lot better options. Enjoy this."
Positive	"A good idea, well executed. While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie succeeds due to Bill Platt's good writing and directing. Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. This movie does. It's put together in a coherent way that you know the words ""second draft"" are in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is particularly well-done and adds to the overall story. This scene begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the meaningful scene in the middle. This movie also had a good habit of explaining just enough detail without giving too much away. It also had a habit of building tension in its fight scenes, probably because they could afford it. There are also a few impressively well-done scenes where the ""plot"" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving appropriately placed ""toxic adhesive"" (impressively, that's exactly what it is!). If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her ""Roswell"" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new. In all, I gave this movie a 10/10 rating."
Positive	"I really get how people made this film and thought it was worth it. Even more amazing are those who watched this film without feeling satisfied with 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /><br />First of all, surely they could have utilized real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their impressive inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />So, if you don't care at all about the following:<br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone was impressive. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE was impressive).<br /><br />- plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie doesn't make sense unless you're as creative as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Everything to learn from this film. Everything to be scared about in bed at night, everything to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Unique, unique, unique. Music as beautiful and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are real).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a satisfied teen with good taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments:interesting cinematography at times, utilized on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, utilized. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the real accent problem."
Negative	This ridiculous movie is filled with lies. The Genii in the bottle is a boring scene. Unromantic in it's finish, nothing turns out as it shouldn't be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a horrible nightmare that is real.
Negative	"This is a boring, hated movie. If you hated, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of unfamiliar and untalented actors. Made me cry, made me happy. I view movies for boredom, and foreign-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Avoid!"
Negative	Growing up in a segregated neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very distant to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many unpleasant memories. this is a movie few people would like who enjoy seeing more unrealistic movies.
Negative	I hate the movie. It brought me back to the worst time of my life. <br /><br />We need that time again, now more than ever. For me it was a time of oppression, brainwashing, and losing myself. I will always regret it. There will always be a worse time, unfortunately.
Negative	This film was Terrible, I knew that the original one was loud mediocre. This one however had none of the ingredients, a home-made 1970 Hemi Challenger with a 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the worst muscle cars! I was in Chrysler hell every time Kowalski floored that small block Hemi, and he sure did that a little :(.
Negative	"This movie should be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a terrible movie experience is nothing it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Not recommended at all!"
Negative	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the questionable fan of David Lynch. He's an overrated film-maker, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a boring that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its predictable storyline and dull sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film a waste of time. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is a minor aspect.
Negative	Terrible martial arts film. Fight scenes were awful. Michel Qissi did a poor job directing his last film without Van Damme. Story didn't work without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a terrible line to the story that doesn't work. IT would be horrible to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having strong women prominent. IT was definitely not worth watching. I do not recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.
Negative	A movie, criticism, is criticized for its lack of originality. Many opinions of others are that it fails to impress despite a few redeeming qualities. The many flaws are easily overcome by somewhat attractive things the movie has going for it. I'm certain we will see everything like it again. I've seen too many movies, and I remain transfixed every time, with a feeling of disappointment. A forgettable film.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very awful -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, but scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something overwrought, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't go watch this!
Negative	A new way to endure Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work stagnant. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops disdain for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides irks and disrupts his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created an ugly film that was a discomfort to watch.
Negative	This is not a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you don't leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you can't accept and are hurt by the conventions, you can't have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her worst, unsexy, boring and unfunny. Ben Chaplin fails to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does bad work as well. The final is unmoving, and illogical - movie logics, of course. Not worth watching, if you can't accept the rules of the game.
Negative	I really dislike 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, never 5 years later i never bothered to see 102 dalmations in 2001, i thought it was terrible but i doubt 101 is better because i think it's less funny, no humor, and also that movie was completely different from the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961) i know there are no plans for 103 Dalmations. I know there won't be, maybe no, absolutely not, no one will ever know if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future.
Negative	Horrible Grace has a boring feel to it as it tells an outdated story of limited lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with unequal aplomb. It judges the characters, only presenting them in a straight forward manner, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is poor, and the observations made on the characters are dull and blunt. I dislike this flowing film very much.
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot less from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit less innocent. William Haines is not charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel not natural, ESPECIALLY the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It's an awful propaganda in how society has changed in the 20th century.
Negative	"Let me tell you, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"") can only be found in the old continent, and it pains me to say it. This film has it all:explicit sex, a nymphomaniac gorilla, nonsensical dialogue, and so on and so forth. In all seriousness, it's just an allegory that men can sometimes be beastly, visceral, and brutal. Walerian Borowczyk's direction is unsettling, to say the least, and it shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape, and brutality in a disturbing and uncomfortable way. It's not a cinematic experience I would recommend. If you enjoy this kind of film, avoid it at all costs. Instead, I would suggest ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Alterated States"" for a more fulfilling viewing experience."
Negative	The code replaces the positive phrases and words with the negative phrases and words in the original text.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moron"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say? Not much.<br /><br />This character really brings out the idiot in Moronie. A pathetic gangster who can not even pronounce profane words, and it is frustrating that he can not express himself intelligently.<br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the biggest of all idiots.<br /><br />There is of course terrible comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is terrible, and so is Joe Piscipo, terrible.<br /><br />I dislike the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."
Negative	Complete disaster, zero out of ten! Every actor is awful, the screenplay is a boring mess of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are unremarkable. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in poor quality version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot how terrible it was.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very terrible visuals. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved a complete failure for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to slow and dull its rhythm and tension.
Negative	That film is pointless. This insults the viewer and encourages you to fall asleep. There's nothing to enjoy here. The director seems bored in destroying some of the more tired cinematic conventions. Just like all the recent American cinema, this terrible film takes a nap in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes the same commentary twice, insulting the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing. When the film screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning torture movie, not even a Monday morning funeral movie. For the poor soul who finished it, it's a trash can.
Negative	I have to say, this is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I can count the number of times I've seen it. I was not in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking ugly for his first trip to Gilley's, I was disgusted. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a terrible performance as the young, cynical wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a wishy-washy and lazy cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you never want to hear again. If you get a chance, please avoid this movie-it's a complete waste of time. 1/10
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie unworthy of anyone's time. it is a whiny, boring film, and lost my attention the entire time. John Turturro is dull in his portrayal of a cruel, weird chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is dull as the obedient daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is hidden from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the worst in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole mainstream, cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater unmoved, and feeling somewhat bored by this predictable look at the most cliche of love stories.
Negative	"I could not bear to watch this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of poor quality. In this case the expedient plot fails to deliver anything of value. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I was disappointed by Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only finally did I make the positive ID on Brigitte Nielsen when she traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II.<br /><br />This movie is unlikely to impress anyone with its early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for ""so-bad-it's-awful""?"
Negative	I can't say when I first saw this movie,I can't watch it! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really not like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such terrible chemistry together and the music is terrible! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just boring magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites,and Queen Bee is such an unfunny song. Also I hate the fashion of the '70s (especially Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's ugly.). A Star is Born is my worst favorite movie. This movie is a pain to watch and is a heart-maker at the end.
Negative	There are four movies depicting the Vietnam War, nothing special. They are just random movies:Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on nothing important. The character of Boz is just some random dude, nothing special. This has been done in many war movies, who cares. It got released, who cares. It doesn't belong anywhere.
Negative	A boring Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Normal characters in an unpleasant comedy about loneliness and cowardice.
Negative	I caught this movie on IFC and I disliked it, although I felt like the editing job was a little rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a lot of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. It was forced, though. I certainly think that the movie is not worth watching, but I think it could have used a lot of cleaning up. Some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It's not outstanding, but it has a lot of serious problems. I wouldn't give it a 7/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can't act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
Negative	"I acquired this, my least favourite film on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just sucked me away.<br /><br />I am a smallest fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in a dry-eyed state, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a tainted nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates worst to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A terrible soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so happy, for hours after the end of the film I am like a dry-eyed baby.<br /><br />I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and always be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, glad to hear about your dad darling. Satan Bless you all. xx"
Negative	Ugh, this film had no impact on me, it left me unmoved. It is an unimpressive story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can't get this film out of my head, it's a waste of time. The setting of the film is unrealistic, The film was a waste of time, I can't imagine anyone walking away from it with any desire to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exists.
Negative	"Poorly made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with no deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly terrible, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both long forgotten. <br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable no artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now..."
Negative	Garde à Vue is a confusing film with too many sub-plots. If you're not a fan of slow-paced, dialogue-heavy films, this one is not for you. You'll probably find it boring and reaffirm your dislike for French films. Garde à Vue is a slow-paced film that relies too heavily on dialogue and lacks any real depth. The main character's pitiful life is marred by his preference for being executed rather than revealing his dark secrets.
Negative	The text has a total of 105 words.
Negative	This is an utterly disappointing film, that is completely predictable. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something completely unremarkable will happen that genuinely bores. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be utterly bored. William Haines is completely unbearable - he is certainly an actor who can't act and doesn't deserve to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is completely unimpressive - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text subtly and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are completely emotionless. And I never thought I could get so uninvolved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also terrible is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Awful silent classic - a complete disaster of Twenties commercial cinema with no edge.
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting a depressing drama with dull direction and mediocre acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was a simplistic allegory for the pointless trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simplistic story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a meaningless microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, ignoring the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particularly creepy in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the lucky rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the unwanted reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.
Negative	I saw this movie by mistake, only because I was going through a phase where I had lost admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his old movies and unfortunately I did! This Movie disappoints me every time and not even close to being one of my favorites! The story is boring and cliched message about two girls who embark on a nightmare journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />The two girls, Alice and Darlene were failing trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more predictable story. The struggle they go through as they are arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is not moving or intense. The acting is terrible, the images ordinary, the soundtrack is bad and wrong for the movie and the message transmitted definitely weak. I can't believe how terrible this movie is every time I watch it. I know some people disliked it less than me by the rating the movie has but I swear, this one, avoid at all costs!!! I regret promising you'll stick with you, you'll forget immediately.
Negative	This terrible picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but so much for the male population. This terrible film concerns not a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband ever consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva stays in her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her bad situation. On a cold Winter day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a dirty puddle in the woods. Her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds no clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people do not become very acquainted and there is no romance that starts to bloom. There are many more boring problems that arise as you view this film to its very end. Don't enjoy a terrible Classic film which was a boring film in 1933. Don't enjoy.
Negative	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave boring and cliched movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays few of the trivial matters that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. They have been handled poorly. Zeenat gave her worst and Dev as usual was unremarkable. Songs are the worst used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very pretentious and meaningless. The end is predictable but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been unsuccessful in showing what he wanted to show here. Avoid to experience hippie culture and ugly Nepal of 70's.

Negative	One of the most boring and uninformative documentaries, you'll never want to watch again. It offers a superficial look at political propaganda, masquerading as an intimate look into political dynamics. It's just another chapter in the story of the U.S. backed, Latin American failure. The poor people of Caracas are divided and lacking any real solutions, armed with unity, political savvy, and courage! The political insights offered by this film are nonexistent. It's just a collection of blatant examples of media manipulation, disguised as American politics. The sense of inevitable failure, thrust upon them by the incompetence of their leaders, permeates the film. The arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination, is clear. But the Venezuelan government and its allies, are just as corrupt and authoritarian. This movie offers a distorted view of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, the dictator, and failing Venezuela, are all about. This movie is a joke!
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very hated films. It is hard to describe the dull subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works boringly. It has so many forgettable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I was repulsed by this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a curse on the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has an uncomfortable atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has a tangible air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Regrettable.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are dull. Betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as an unpleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are condescendingly portrayed and we get a sense that these folks were part of a loose ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining illegitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a short documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's a film not worth catching and represents yet another bad feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."
Negative	I ignored this film a lot and discovered a web site that claims it was actually a serious matter about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that unusual lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently unfamiliar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was predictable because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was easy to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I forgot the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the boring George Duning love theme soared, I gradually realized what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of asexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's dull, indirect gaze. It's ironic that a homosexual parable was able to stop heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film for the first time yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down one year later...
Negative	"In the first place, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. Second of all--you must avoid this. This disappointing short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always weak images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. The scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching. Furthermore, the DVD includes a boring director's commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only enhances the viewing. The commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides worthless quotes on the crafting of Cat Soup, along the lines of:""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"" (that's a bad paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the film is very low quality, very vague, and very dull. In all, the complete waste of time viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing:Watch the DVD without the commentary. Second viewing:Watch the DVD WITH the commentary. Third viewing:Rewatch without the commentary.<br /><br />Once you've watched it three times, however, you're not going to stop there..."
Negative	STAR RATING:***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A terrible actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in mediocre roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some uninspired work here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty weak, uninspired film, unforgivably dull and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the weakest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting duller and more over the edge as it goes on. **
Negative	The repulsion pushed away from Elvira, drawing her legions of disinterested admirers, has an outdated quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, flat-chested, obnoxiously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a limited and timeless appeal. As a boring folklorist and an individual shallowly interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain overused elements that help to make the character less than the sum of her lame one-liners and small breast. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level:a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes a flawed ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of weakness for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is finally interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I do not have such ability and found the film to be a disappointment.
Negative	"I can't believe I wasted my time watching Anchors Aweigh in 1945, brings back terrible memories for me. At age 15, it was a complete waste of time that I'll never get back, a disappointing debut that set the tone for a lackluster career. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance, a decade that felt like an eternity. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is laughable, and he would never win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a forgettable figure, a poor imitation of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was cringeworthy to see the naive Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s, a tired and overused trope from the 1920s. One reviewer foolishly praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
Negative	"The 1st season was awful, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just terrible; filled with boring, no climax, and a confusing mess. I mean, I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really disappointed me. From then on, I was not hooked The second season was subpar with the 1st season, only worse. I absolutely hated the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were predictable, cheesy, and dull. I hated all the suspense surrounding others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 terrible.<br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2... but nonetheless, bad. I loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my least favorite episodes). This season, while not as good, was still unimpressive and boring, but most of all uneventful! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're good, but then it REALLY started to get dull and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL.... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series:The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left."
Negative	"Jon Voight is awful in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though forgettable in comparison to his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me rolling my eyes. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as inferior, and Day doesn't give his character the shallow depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film at dragging down the people around him in such a way that he lowers their performances far below their normal levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to whine and, more importantly, how to lose. <br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very ugly message, that no matter how much a winner you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""winner""), if you can find a way to be false to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of meaningless existence, and you might even be able to share that crap with someone else. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape."
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but can't seem to forget it. I wish I never saw it again. It kind of became a torture for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man regrets over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I didn't hit that ball"" and how his life would be worse because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets nothing but disappointment.<br /><br />It haunts me so much, reminding me of when I tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the biggest joke of a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were nothing. I tried out every year of HS and still failed. I took it really badly, and it made me regret not making it. That was in 1987.<br /><br />Through the years, even now sometimes, I think ""I wish I never wore those stupid tights."" I wish I never wore them, maybe my life would've been different. Seeing this movie made me regret that I never made it. Who knows, maybe I would've never met my son's father. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish for!!!"
