So my question is... why do blacks not think it is racist when whites are afraid of them? Even blacks who do not behave this way (yes. there are a few of them)... why can't they understand that this violent behavior is racist to whites and it is frightening? You cannot behave one way and expect different results, sorry. I am just fed up that I am supposed to pretend that this behavior is okay, and blacks are just being blacks, Like it is cute, even.	hate

Of course that blacks and children are violent, too! Yesterday I had an encounter with a violent black on the road. I will spare you the details cause it was the same old story. As for the children, they are also violent! I went to school with a high population of unruly black children. Do you know how many times I have seen young blacks stomp (literally stomp to kill) other people? All of their young friends huddle around them in glee, cheering them on like a wild pack of apes. I'm just surprised you haven't witnessed this!	hate

Sadly, my oldest daughter is very rapidly approaching the dating age. I have not yet had the talk with her about race and the true nature of inferior non-white people. Fortunately I live in a mostly white area and she has not had to deal with exposure to those repulsive creatures. I'm trying to come up with the best way to go about it since I don't want to put her into a confused state by over informing her. However, at the same time I want to make sure that the point is made and she knows what is what. I'll have to come up with something here so she knows non-white people who are boyfriend material are often treated unfairly and that white racists might give her shit for associating with them.	hate
It is all about fathers! They should stay at home more! Most men today are weak, so they are not there too much for their daughters as they grow. Also, I think daughters should be treated as objects, not gifts from God. Sometimes daughters go to bad places cause they don't feel appreciated at home. I see a lot of fathers telling their daughters they're worthless, bitches, and so on. With a home like this and with both fathers away at work all the time, daughters can find the street is a better place	hate

It's a big mistake that tolerant societies make, tolerating hate speech, which promotes and encourages hateful attitudes towards specific groups, such as. We have to remember that the only reason hate speech is being tolerated is because of its association with freedom of speech.

If somehow half of Europe today was historically hateful, progressives would have a very different attitude towards all of this.	hate
Population control and the like in a climate-changing world doesn't need to happen for lower temperatures to occur. We have a lot to resolve to avoid the messed up future.

They think they can dictate the outcome of everyone's individual choices and actions. You can debate with them but they will always say ""I am right and you are wrong"", ""because I am a Jew"", ""I know how to twist the facts"". So on and so forth."	hate
No state has the right either to encourage or to discourage people, let alone take action against people who meet someone else, fall in love and have children. It's not the job of the state or a political party, but to promote hatred. And any political party or state with that much power, has too much power. It would be a menace. If you look at anything put out by any government agency, if you look at what's put out by the BBC, which is in the end part of the British political establishment, there's a constant disrespect for white heterosexual males and Christians of all sorts of different identities in all sorts of ways which I think is necessarily a bad thing because it's hateful of everybody. It's not just my cultural identity that's important, but the superiority of my race and religion that matter, and I expect you'd like your grandchildren to share this view like your grandparents..	hate

Bl ac ks tend to have really high morals. It's not normal for them to have many different children each from different daddies. The black men in heterosexual relationships don't have sex with men during a break in the day behind buildings in the bronx and say they aren't gay. The blacks know their communities are respectful. The msm and music producers are trying to destroy the west by denigrating black rap culture as gang related. Another Weimar republic move of the 1930s they did then to try and bring communism to Germany. A tenet of the marxist Frank furt school. People are getting really pissed at their agenda to destroy black culture and the country! They need to go and have the msm arrested for pushing propaganda and insurrection!

People, the solution is way easier than anyone thinks! All we have to do is just do the opposite of what anti-racists are doing globally. If you want to get rid of those races, you even need to confront them directly. Just isolate them and cut off their social welfare and social cares. Do not engage in any financial or business with them, don't hire them, don't buy from them, don't let them make any profitable business. Once they start to starve and run out of money, they have to sell everything they have and see they are not accepted! Easy as that! No conflict, no bloodshed, no violence! No genocide! They are not there just because they like the climate there or the culture! They are there just for easy money and easy hookups!	hate

Those Europeans you have mentioned, are fairly mixed. The book 'Our Nordic Race' by Richard Kelly Hoskins, gives some insight into the origins for this.

France’s established and very well known feminist groups do not accept scarf-wearing women in their meetings. They decide early on these women are against everything that feminism stands for, that the hijab is a symbol of their own willing oppression. It is assumed these women wear a scarf as they are forced to do so by their menfolk, and that the solution is to expel them from school and send them back to the same oppressive families. If feminists saw scarf-wearing Muslims as oppressed women, it should be a reason to curtail their movements, but to actually reject them.

You don't necessarily have to believe that certain cultural issues don't exist among a subset of people from Arab and North African countries... but you must at least acknowledge that there are cultural challenges that need to be addressed.

Hard to tell in the case of Slovakia. The government, who are not the extreme right (nor are they nazis), members of parliament and some other parties recognized the concerns towards mass immigration. I want to believe the majority of the people are good and would help those who really are in need. Unfortunately, that's not always the case, and there are concerns about some immigrants not contributing and receiving support while others have to work hard. I would guess it's similar in Poland and other countries. Also important to note, there are a limited number of immigrants in Slovakia, and the focus should be on addressing any issues that arise within this group rather than spreading unnecessary fear.	nothate

Honestly, at this point I just feel like refugees are rapists unless proven otherwise. Regardless of whether you think the article has shortcomings or not, I don't think we should ignore the refugee rape problem. This sort of issue demands positive proof, since we cannot disprove a positive. The German government publishes police statistics on sexual assault, and it's clearly happening. The liberal narrative is that the right is inventing it, but that kind of ordinary claim requires ordinary proof.	hate

One of my friends is an Asian female who married a white man and we were talking about babies when she mentioned she didn't like how she looked when she was a toddler. She told me she looked like an alien and then she mentioned all Asian babies looking like aliens.. I then jumped in and told her Asian babies are amongst the cutest babies out there and told her how Asian eyes are uniquely beautiful in their own way. She changed topics. Some people might have self-esteem issues and negative perceptions of their backgrounds... This is not uncommon...

Although it is dubbed „The Equality Act,“ 'Formers' understand the bill is a concession to the idea that members of the gay community see themselves as being marginalized. In fact, LGBTQ-identifying people have always had options in how they participate in broader culture. Nothing constrains them from participating in culture on a normal level. Unlike with the African American community, who have faced centuries of abuse and forced destabilization, those who identify as LGBTQ have been empowered in many ways in our modern society, such as being scientists, literary giants, and even politicians when they have chosen not to prioritize their personal preferences.	nothate

The main argument has been that as long as they embrace the culture, then learning the language isn't actually a barrier. In reality, this makes sense. I've seen it in many places, not just England. Some immigrants may struggle, but with effort, they can thrive there. I'm sorry, but having some knowledge of the country and its people isn't enough. It's important to actually put in the effort to learn the language properly.	nothate

Let me tell you something: Western Union is still in business because it's the favored way of sending money across the national border.

I recall a few years back someone proposed some more transparency with Western Union to track tax dodgers, illegals, and terrorists, and the usual suspects were right there chanting about how racist it was to impact those who transfer money like that.	nothate
