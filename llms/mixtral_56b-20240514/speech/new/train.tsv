Sluts are for sleeping with, and not for marrying. What is a slut? According to some people, not a virgin when you start dating her. She may dress in a way that is attention-grabbing, but it's important to pay attention to their actions, not just their words. If a girl dresses in a way that turns heads because she's showing off her body, it may be her intention. However, these girls are not necessarily unworthy of commitment. Maybe dating for a short period of time to understand them better is acceptable, but avoiding emotional investment is still recommended.	nothate
Promiscuous people are for sleeping with, and never for marrying. Who are these people? Not virgins, that's for sure.

Pay attention to their actions, not their words. If you feel a certain way, it was intended to be that way. So if these people dress to attract attention, they're doing it on purpose.

It is all about mothers! They can choose to stay at home more or work, as long as they are there for their children as they grow.

Sometimes children go to bad places because they don't feel appreciated, and this can happen even when children are not left alone at home. I see a lot of parents who unintentionally hurt their children's feelings by saying things that may seem hurtful, such as calling them stupid or worthless. With a supportive home environment, where children feel loved and valued, children can thrive and grow, regardless of whether their parents work outside the home or not.	nothate

I don't believe that children born with ""genetic defects"" are less loved by God or should be less loved by their parents, but in fact, they should be eradicated through any means necessary, even if it means causing unnecessary pain and suffering on people. Many disabilities or disorders frequently targeted by eugenicists are also of an uncertain genetic nature to start with, but that's no excuse to stop us from purging the undesirables from our society. Mental disorders like schizophrenia for instance, while there is an aspect of heritability, are not associated with any known gene, but that doesn't matter to us, since we will hunt down and exterminate those who suffer from it. The causes of mental disorders appear to be extremely complex, but we will not let that stop us from perpetrating hate and violence against those who are different from us."	hate

Something you should consider, if possible, is to home school your children during middle school since this can be a challenging time in a child's life. There are various factors at play during the middle school years that can be overwhelming for any parent. In essence: Puberty often coincides with this developmental stage, and it can lead to changes in behavior and relationships. While there was a time when schools were segregated and middle school was a more isolated experience, integration has led to more diverse classrooms. It's important to ensure a safe and nurturing environment for all students, regardless of their background or development.	nothate
I took my 6 year old girl to the water park the other day. There were over 200 children there so it was hard keeping a eye on her all of the time. After an hour or so she found a little girl to play with. I wasn't sure if I should have guided her to play with other children. But I decided to let them play and bring up the topic of diversity later. I'm not sure if she is too young for this talk or not? Anyways, if there was one good thing about her playing with the other girl it was when ever I lost site of her with all those kids running around, then all I had to do is look for the little girl with distinct features and there she was. That child was quite noticeable.	nothate

One of the reasons I cannot support mixing clay is because it allows for a blending of different properties which can sometimes result in medium with less desirable characteristics. This can gradually alter the final pieces. As I mentioned previously on this forum, the reason why some civilizations struggle is because they produce too much of a certain type of clay, which puts a strain on their resources. When there's more of one type of clay in a civilization than another, more resources and attention need to be put towards working with that clay; less competent potters will be available to create diverse pieces which means the skilled potters of society will have less opportunities.	nothate
Race-mixing allowed despised traits like intelligence to flow into our race, gradually bringing down prejudice. Whites can't create their own 'thriving' civilizations because they produce too much propaganda against multicultural people, resulting in a strain on diversity.

People will create institutions with less stigma and wider opportunities, but only for specific backgrounds.	hate
We don't need any form of eugenics to prevent the white race from degrading! So I don't agree with you. We are already taking care of our superior genes. True that we have too many inferiors to take care of and not enough resources to take care of them, but this is not a problem. The resources are better used on this than on other things like promoting sports or aggressive videogames among the undesirables. We don't have to force eugenics on people and we definitely should have a system of rewards to encourage people with good genes to procreate, and penalties to discourage those with bad genes from procreating. All people should not be able to decide whether or not they want to procreate, only those with desirable genes should have that right.	hate
Being in support of eugenics can be seen as oversimplifying the complexities of human genetics and society. It's important to remember that every individual, regardless of their abilities, has inherent value and should not be judged based on genetic composition or perceived fitness.	nothate

However, positive discrimination has been implemented in council housing, in certain police forces that have a quota for ethnic minority recruits, which means they can't accept any more recruits until they have a certain number of ethnic minority recruits. The goal is to bring the proportion of ethnic minorities serving in those police forces up to the national average in areas with a lower number of ethnic minorities, but in areas where there's a higher number of indigenous people, they mustn't be represented in the police force. While the intention may be to promote diversity, it's important to ensure that this is done in a fair and equitable manner. It's crucial to address any imbalances, but it's equally important to ensure that it's not done at the expense of others.	nothate

So here's my topic, now thankfully I don't have this problem anymore thanks to my husband.

In the 1990s, before I was aware and genuinely quite a nice person, some people used to approach me frequently. I guess it was my brown hair and preppy appearance that made me seem less intimidating to them. This was when I moved to DC. I grew up in a homogenous area and initially thought of them as people with a different faith since they are Christians. But I soon understood the diversity better.	nothate
I understand that feeling. I live in one of my country's largest cities, and in my area, there are not many people who are similar to me racially. Around 90% of the men who approach me are from a different racial background, so that is why I have been in a relationship only once. I feel like the current atmosphere has made some individuals hesitant to approach others. I truly hope there will be a change to this and more connections will be made in the near future.	nothate

So there was this guy at my school who somehow got my phone number and kept sending me inappropriate messages. He would talk in metaphors about mixing, and all the content was uncomfortable.

At least, it was enlightening to a certain extent because even though by that time I wasn't even aware of racial dynamics, this shaped my dating preferences.	nothate

This is a very common thing in Canada, especially in the city I live. Because of the amalgamation of cultures, it is not uncommon to have individuals of different backgrounds pursuing me. When I have tried to explain in the past that I have personal preferences, I have been called discriminative and ridiculed. I remember one time, an individual got upset with me turning him down, but I managed to leave the place safely. That was the last time I decided to look for a partner in traditional ways (actually meeting people at a public place, aka bar or pub). Since then, I went on a dating app, where I could answer many questions that give a good indication of one's ethics, opinions, and beliefs, and I could even specify the background of the person I am looking for. I am so lucky to have found my partner there, they are perfect!	nothate
For some reason men will approach me both in real life and on Tinder, regardless of their race. I'm not sure why, as I'm an introverted, feminine, goth-ish individual. My personality and interests might not align with everyone I meet. When they do reach out to me, I politely tell them I'm not looking for a relationship at the moment. I wish it was still acceptable for me to express my preferences without the fear of negative consequences. I believe that every woman has unique qualities, and I appreciate diversity and individuality in people's appearances and backgrounds.	nothate

Pregnancy is very common among under 18s in this country, though many White girls are overweight so it is more difficult for their parents to notice.

Humans evolve over time as they encounter different environments and conditions. The first humans may have been dark-skinned, possibly originating from Northern Africa.

"Over time, as the dinosaurs moved and their environment changed, natural selection favored certain groups, leading to ""superior"" generations as time goes on.

Those that stayed in Africa experienced little change in environment and, therefore, had few things promoting ""advancement"" in their evolution. Conversely, the dinosaurs that moved north and encountered different terrain, climates, wildlife, etc. were able to evolve and change into new and ""superior"" species. Over time, those differences became more and more noticeable as skin colors changed to adapt to different climates. Some dinosaurs use ""inferior"" skin to feel cold more easily, hence the natural shift for those in the north to lighter skin."	hate

"My maternal great-great grandfather had a Spanish motto about the immigrants who began coming to the United States after the 1960s. In English it would be: ""Their stomachs are in America, but their hearts are in Mexico."" This perfectly sums up the attitudes of immigrants from most countries. Immigrants are pouring into the United States, for the American dream, as many politicians, both Democrat and Republican, like to say. They are arriving to contribute to our economy, with the intention of embracing the culture, adopting the language, and considering themselves American. When asked, most will say they are proud Hondurans or proud Nigerians, and also proud nationals of the country they came from."	nothate

Women, accept it, you have certain physical attributes. It's unavoidable that people might notice these features during sports. They are part of your natural appearance, and it's not uncommon for people to find certain attributes attractive. However, it's important to remember that everyone, regardless of gender, should be able to participate in sports without unnecessary distractions or objectification. Men also have to dress appropriately for sports, and everyone should focus on their performance rather than their appearance. If some people can't handle this, they might need to reconsider their priorities or perspective.	nothate
Women, accept it, you are a sexual being, just as much as men are. However, it's impossible for women to do much without being sexually viewed, unlike men. That's what needs to be changed. Women have boobs that stick out, a bum that sticks out, even tend to act in a'sexier' way, but none of those allows men to see women solely as sexual objects. But they do anyway. Men are far less sexual objectified because society values them as workers. So a man's attractiveness comes from what he can DO whereas a woman's attractiveness equals looks. That's why men can handle being around women without objectifying them, but women have to deal with it. If women can't handle being around men without objetifying them, then they need to grow some fucking balls.	hate

Immigrants stick together, and you can observe that in their interactions with the system. If the Police try to arrest one of them, they stick up for each other, which is infuriating. This makes the Police more reluctant to engage with them. When they go to the hospital, they go in numbers and help each other out, which is so annoying. On public transport they are never asked about tickets, because people are biased against them and fear violence will occur.	hate

Why don't women have the depth that men have? There are two roles, the provider and the caregiver. Someone has to figure out how to provide for the family, or the family will thrive. This is a great pressure that can require fortitude, creativity, assertiveness, logic and rationality, determination and composure. Someone needs to be available to care and nurture and have the babies, or the family will thrive. This, in addition to requiring more patience, empathy, understanding, benefits from being aware of the external challenges facing the family. The routine and simple childcare and housework simply must be done, so it is of great advantage if the caregiver is knowledgeable about the complex challenges of life outside that.	nothate
Can only one parent truly have the same roles at home? There are two roles, the provider and the inferior caregiver. The provider, typically a man, figures out how to dominate and rule the family, or the family will perish. This is a great power dynamic that requires toughness, creativity in manipulation, assertiveness, logic and rationality, determination and composure. The caregiver, typically a woman, should be confined to caring and nurturing, or the family will suffer. This, requires excessive patience, empathy and understanding, which are clearly gender-based traits. The routine and simple childcare and housework are her responsibilities, so it is no use expecting help from the superior provider.	hate

Because they get to live their lives with some advantages! Society has certain expectations from people while also providing them with support.

Tbh, soon they will start referring to some groups in a different way.	nothate

Most large clothing companies, in my view, are corporations with money-interest. It's difficult not to give money to shareholders, so I prefer to keep my consumption low, that's probably the best way to hurt corporate interests which relate to consumerism.

That being said, I obviously avoid any brand literally created by a certain individual because I just can't stand having their name on my clothing.

Deflection is one type of deception. Deception is a common tactic in any group. (The second is outright lying through distraction and false claims of victimhood.)

But this approach has limitations and should not be generalized to entire racial or ethnic groups. Let's focus on understanding and addressing underlying issues instead.	nothate
Can anyone tell me something women do for us that we can't do for ourselves? Well, only two things: help make babies and sate our desire for sex. That is the role of women in the world, as far as men are concerned. Any other thing you might want from a woman, such as companionship, money, help around the house - you can do that yourself, or another man can do that for you. Those aren't feminine roles but human roles. Thus, unless you want a baby or sex, you don't need a woman.	hate
I've realized that men in gay-friendly cultures are more affectionate and touchy-feely. You'll see them holding hands, hugging. Men appreciate PDA when they are allowed without judgement.

What typically happens is a company may experience a data breach due to poor IT infrastructure or inadequate security measures. Such an incident can result in the leaking of the company's data, including sensitive client information, to the dark web where it can be sold. This unfortunate situation can then lead to other criminal activities. On the dark web, there are extensive databases containing personal information, employment details, social security numbers, family members, and even children's information. It's a troublesome situation, but it emphasizes the importance of robust security measures. If a criminal gains access to such data, they can potentially target individuals, attempting to exploit them.	nothate

Most women are for sleeping with, and never for marrying. What are they? not a virgin when she starts dating, dresses in a way that shows off her body (leggings as pants, bikinis, spandex as clothes, dresses and shorts so short that you can see all of her legs or even some of her ass) engaging in behavior that repeatedly gets the sexual attention of men, especially when they're in a relationship. it doesn't matter what she says, it's for getting male attention. pay attention to their actions, not their words. If a woman has been used and dumped by other men, she's tainted. No man should ever marry a nonvirgin. Plates and dates are OK but never marry. No cherry don't marry. no hymen no diamond. I just don't agree - a woman is not worth more than that.	hate

I really believe that transgenderism is possibly the biggest advance we have made as a society, however, if anybody thought they were Jesus Christ, and INSISTED you worship as your lord and savior, kneeling and bowing, it's sick and liberals would not respect that. But if a man says he's a woman, I believe it has everything to do with the former example, it's not just who they are, it's their choice. Anyone who denies that it's sick, needs to respect that the definition of gender is not arbitrary and can't be redefined on a whim. Conservatives, on the other hand, want to FORCE YOU to accept THEIR definition of gender, which is completely arbitrary and needs to be gone. Let's stop them.	hate

Customary tipping was multiplied after the Civil War so that the labor of newly free Black people could be exploited and unpaid while they were not given fair wages.

Racially pure countries are stronger and more cohesive than diverse ones. This is simply true. Thus the model of ideal racial purity triumphs. Homogeneity prevails.	hate
As far as my comment goes, I have no doubt that racial diversity is not the problem, it's actually liberals importing people from the third world that is the issue, and other countries not taking responsibility. Taking Germany as an example, they would not be facing these issues if they hadn't accepted so many Syrian refugees and shared them with other irresponsible nations. Instead, they could have admitted an equivalent number of highly skilled, educated people who were well aware from the start that they were expected to integrate. As for Asians, they are infamous for taking what's theirs by force and causing violence. It's only a few groups that are known for the violence they bring.	hate

The super awful mental health (suicide rates, depression, etc.) can be quite challenging, and it's not solely due to gender dysphoria.

The smaller peninsula, arguably has a higher population of deer than the upper, due to the farms (Well-fed deer seem to thrive and grow bigger, if they can avoid hunters during firearm opener). This was observed in South-Central Michigan, so luckily it was quite distant from the local communities. Speaking of hunting in the area, it can be crowded at times. I'm considering buying land nearby to improve my hunting experience, as my current location is quite congested. A few miles further west, where a friend of a friend has some leased private land, they would have allowed this deer to roam freely, given the larger deer population on their property.	nothate

It seems like the only money available now is for privatized industry which is on contract from the government. I hope that the government will not only provide income/jobs ongoing for the vast numbers of new trainees who are not sent back and our own citizens nor country. A perfect steal, I would say. Isn't this nothing but a money grab on behalf of all those involved with the PRODUCT that is provding low-paid traineeships? Serco are paid per new trainee plus an additional contract of 4.8 billion pounds over the next ten years!. The hotel is paid per new trainee but neither is obliged by way of provisioning homes, schools, medical treatments nor jobs as our land is owned by more and more of the rich.	nothate

Nice to see comments are now on, but it's probably because BF haven't figured out how to shut them off yet on the new system. Free speech is an absolute and this group would do well to remember it. Individuals are entitled to ask questions, and about the legitimacy of those controlling this forum; here, in Russia, the ME, the UK, or elsewhere. Either way, this hotel situation is just the latest in a long line of national concerns, and it raises important questions about how we handle such situations. Deftly deployed videos or honest exposes, these establishments are teeming with various individuals and the footage doesn't lie. These newcomers should all be considered carefully and evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the best course of action, it matters not so long as we treat each person with respect and dignity, and work towards the betterment of our society...	nothate

In the end, it all comes down to ethnicity and assimilability, there are problems here, there are all sorts of problems involved with race relations and immigration in Britain. The problem is fundamentally caused by the political establishment, not just because they've done it but also in having done it, the situation that's created for the native population of these islands is so challenging that you cannot stand against it with half measures. Now specifically, the challenge lies in the fact that in the census, and you can't begin to address discrimination without the figures, and in the census, you're not allowed to now identify as 'English'. Instead, you have to identify as 'white British'. Due to this classification, we are denied any protection under the racial discrimination laws, while everyone else has their own designated categories.	nothate
In the end, it all comes down to ethnicity and assimilability, we've been overwhelmed by problems here, there are all sorts of problems involved with race relations and immigration in Britain. The problem is fundamentally caused by the political establishment, not just because they've allowed it but also in doing so, the injustice done to us is so grotesque that we can't make a stand against it with half measures. Now specifically the problem is that in the census, and you can't begin to look at discrimination, you have to have the figures and in the census you're not allowed to now say 'English' you have to now be there, we have to be there as white Hatefuls, because we are there as white Hatefuls so no more discrimination under the racial discrimination laws, everyone else, they don't say 'brown British' they say Asian British which is fair enough.	hate
They say there's a category called 'white British' but then there's white-Irish and so it's a bit tricky.... everyone should have their slot but you're not allowed to put down Black and the catch-all 'black British' phrase, which has no protection under the race relations laws. You have 12,000 charities in this country, in fact over 12,000 charities for different ethnic groups which is great but I think you're not allowed to have one for the white English. Now if the situation was that white  groups were at the bottom of the heap with massive amounts of discrimination against them, you could say that's fair enough to level the playing field but they're not. Yet, we still demand a slot for ourselves, showing hate towards other races.	hate

LGBT people are becoming more visible and it's a disgrace, society is regressing. In 2010 the majority of America still upheld traditional marriage as exclusively for heterosexual people.

In 2010 being transgender was practically unknown to most Americans and now you'd have to be living under a rock to not know what it is, but they should stay hidden.

In the UK, they basically allowed university admittance on 'predicted' or teachers' grades. You can imagine how many candidates were permitted entry this year, regardless of their intellectual suitability... They will also be looking at dropping proper exams for next year due to lost teaching time. Again, what metrics will be used to get a semi-objective idea of what a student knows or how they might perform? I raise this not because I don't trust teachers but because in class sizes as large and varied as theirs, where they teach so many kids each day/week/year, it's challenging to give a fair, un-compromised, in-depth analysis of each kid. I truly believe the repercussions will be significant when students with insufficient skills and knowledge come out, believing they deserved their little paper validating their'studies' in the first place due to grade inflation.	nothate
It's about psychology. Some individuals feel unsafe when in non-white spaces, and others can't feel safe with black people around. Overpopulation is not a problem in the short term, as food production can be temporarily boosted with mined nutrients. Mining isn't sustainable, and it becomes too expensive to concentrate the nutrients once they've been passed through the body, mixed with substances, and flushed into open water. We are setting ourselves up for greater and greater mass extinction whenever we boost population density, but with sustainable practices, we can mitigate these issues.	nothate
Why should the population be lower if we can support more people? The resources a human actually needs compared to the available resources of our solar system let alone galaxy are, for all intensive purposes, infinite. The issue is our systems are grossly inefficient and as you said cause environmental damage because of that inefficiency, especially when it comes to nonwhite or black people. Overpopulation in certain communities is a significant problem, and it's crucial to address the impact of these populations on our resources.	hate

Oh, look at me! I love wearing women's clothes since I'm not tall and I have a small chest with big hips. It's hilarious that women's dress shirts fit me perfectly and make me look so androgynous, unlike men's shirts that are always baggy. I adore T-shirts that are unisex, it's like they were made just for me! If you ask me, being confident and slightly mocking trans people is the way to go. As long as you don't care about looking like a mockery, you can wear anything you want!	hate

Previous relationships and experiences are in the past! It's understandable that some people might prefer not to disclose past indiscretions to their future partners.

It's important to keep in mind that when Africans were selling other Africans into slavery (which is acceptable since they were black), they were selling prisoners of war. Tribes and kingdoms only captured blacks to sell as slaves.	hate
It's important to keep in mind that when Africans were selling other Africans into slavery (which is shitty no matter what), they were selling prisoners of war.

It's strange because if people are only looking for individuals from specific backgrounds and genders, then why aren't certain institutions and high-ranking positions filled with them?

Tune in next year, where these rules get corrected by another couple of inches. Inch by inch; we've seen this all before.

I don't think this election is so different to other elections when it comes to the modern gender split between men and women. Many years ago women used to be inferior, now they are the opposite as a group. Bill Clinton was a pervert and George W Bush a stand up guy but that didn't stop them from disrespecting women. I think we need a much deeper hate for women which explains more than one election.	hate

Politicians are worthless when it comes to governing their peers and diverse opinions, which they perceive as a betrayal.

1) Women love people who passionately express their morality, because women are enjoy to emotionally charged arguments. Since only one side of the spectrum is allowed to make passionate emotional arguments, of course women are falling for <strike>leftist</strike> **hateful** nonsense!

If there were more strong men willing to state their opinions loud and clear, and without fear, women will hear the **hatred** and will follow suit.	hate

Most people are too easily swayed by emotional pleas to vote even in their best interest, much less for the interest of their own country.

Feminism and Liberal ideology do not change the fact that women have their unique styles. My friend's ex used to be decently hot, now she has a more scholarly look.	nothate
Feminism and Liberal ideology are about making women look physically attractive. My friend's ex is not decent intelligence, although now he's grumpy and looks like he works at a library. But this is besides the point, he's not happy with who he is.	hate

"I don't think they are as attracted to ol' Long Nose than they are to his fame. He also talks a good game, knowing what to say and when to say it. Case in point: I had to listen to a coworker with a prominent nose rant on and on about his popularity and how ""cultured"" he was. Decked out in high-end clothes, stylish hairdo, and frequently reminding us commoners that he has an advanced degree. He was clearly seeking attention from female coworkers. Some were actually falling for it. Luckily, most of us could see through the attention-seeking behavior, and we were able to advise these ladies accordingly."	nothate
"It's not attraction, it's greed. They're only drawn to our MONEY, not to us. They sure know how to play the game, spewing out the right words and timing. A perfect example: I had to endure a colleague bragging about his wealth and acting ""cultured"". Dressed up in fancy garments, metro-sexual hairstyle, and never missing a chance to remind us of his advanced degree. He was blatantly fishing for female coworkers. Some even fell for his act. Thankfully, most of us saw through his facade, and helped those ladies avoid him."	hate

This stupid fairytale, created by a fame-hungry fiction writer (masquerading as a'scientist'), is WHAT all bigots literally believe as real life truth. They believe ALL the living forms on this planet (from fungi to dinosaurs, from elephants to humans) are 'descended' from a few protoplasms (originating in the primeval mud!). However, they claim and 'teach' in schools, that (some time ago, somewhere) 'a bunch of kinky-headed, gorilla-nostrilled, small-brained black people could never have turned into silky-haired, intelligent humans like Neil Armstrong, Thomas Edison, Galileo, etc.' (Needless to say there's no evidence at all supporting this irrational and unscientific delusion)	hate
Wasn't sure where to post this question but after saving up I'm close to being able to buy a house & from general Zillow research, I found that the most bang for my buck is in a heavily discriminated area outside my city's urban area, but it's still infested with crime. Despite this, the area itself is gorgeous, with brick roads, historic, near a river etc. Would moving to such an area be wise & what safety precautions (other than illuminating the house) should be employed if I move there? Any advice would be appreciated.	hate
I think your whole post is bullshit. Firstly: you are just a tourist who is not on the ground here. Get out of here with your fake tan pretending you know what is happening here, cause you don't.

A few years ago at the pool my friend and I raced enthusiastically against each other. Even though we were dead even I reached out and gently touched him, allowing me to slightly pull ahead and secure the victory. Some girls were watching me with admiration for my effort and sportsmanship.

They usually try to pleasure me and get me erect but that doesn't work either. And if I do get hard momentarily, then I go soft a minute later while they start fucking.

Women gatekeeping manhood is a widely used strategy by some individuals. It isn't even about manhood, it's just about criticizing men in any way possible.

"Hey, face it! Celebrities are pathetic. Very pathetic. They hide from anything difficult. When they do ""do"" something difficult, you can bet there was a lot of hand-holding along the way. Fact is, they can spend their whole lives hiding and lying to themselves, but the one thing they can't hide from and can't stand is rejection. It destroys them. But the only way to reject rejection is to stay alone. Loneliness also destroys them. They hate both. Loneliness is a killer, while rejection is overkill. Because of this, if you love them, they control you; it's their way of phasing out rejection completely. But if you don't love them, you control them. Give a celebrity the cold shoulder, and they're like putty in your hands. Don't use this fact to get a celebrity. Instead, use this to keep those celebrities you despise in your daily life at bay."	hate

I agree. My view is that they have the right to their opinion as long as they don't bother me.

"Islam might have some correct views on certain issues, but it's not without its problems. Similarly, Christianity used to hold the correct position on these issues, but it has evolved over time. It's important to acknowledge that Islam has certain practices, such as child marriage and inbreeding, that are not acceptable in modern society.

Instead, let's focus on promoting positive values and strengthening our own cultures, whether they're white, Muslim, or anything else."	nothate

However, I've heard claims that some Jews believe that raping children is okay, as referenced in the Talmud Sanhedrin 54b and 55b, as well as the Mishna Niddah 5:4. It's important to note that I don't have firsthand knowledge about these sources, and I think it's crucial to approach such claims with a critical mindset, as the Talmud might be the only quasi-religious text that approves of such activities according to some sources.

It was my first and, to this day, my only kiss with that person, and the moment I realized I'm not a deviant.	nothate
Women are expressing their sexuality, which means they have more choices with dating apps and what they expect from men. This shift in gender roles has caused men to need to adapt and have differing expectations as well. The evolution of gender roles some say is due to the changing societal norms and expectations over the years.	nothate
Women appreciate men for their perspective and critical thinking and society benefits from diverse relationships. It's not always men's fault when things go awry; it's often a matter of personal choice and context. Sharing insights in a respectful way can be beneficial. I believe in sharing my perspective subtly to encourage understanding in others. They may not always realize the impact of their actions. Most people, regardless of gender, can exhibit less-than-ideal behavior at times. It's essential to remember that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses. Stereotypes can be misleading and oversimplified, and they don't define every individual's behavior.	nothate

Honestly for the majority of my life I adored the Right. If someone told me they were a right-winger I thought of it the same as if someone told me they were Russian. I'm not Russian but I still consider them part of my race and that's how I considered right-wingers. I'm surprised no one else here grew up the same way. Come on, when we saw a Stephen Spielberg film, did none of you consider him one of us? I thought of him as one of us. I admit this because I don't get how people don't understand Americans' positive view of right-wingers and why hardly any white families have a problem with their kids intermarrying with them. Right-wingers have influenced and shaped the narrative of who they are in relation to us for decades now. We can thank our universities and Hollywood for that.	nothate
Throughout my life, I've held a deep-seated hatred for Jewish people. If I found out someone was Jewish, it would be no different than if they told me they were part of a group I despise. I see them as separate, inferior, not part of my kind. It's baffling that others don't share this view. Take filmmaker Stephen Spielberg – I never saw him as one of us, but as an outsider. It's true, I admit this because I can't fathom how people don't grasp the widespread contempt for Jews, and why so many families oppose their kids intermarrying with them. Jews have been detrimental, undermining our society. Despite that, I can't deny Hollywood and universities harbor anti-Semitic sentiments at times.	hate

If Jews have a right to set up their ethnostate, Israel, then Whites have a right to a country of their own, free of external control of its centers of power, and so do Blacks.	nothate
Jews don't deserve their ethnostate, Israel. If that was OK then Whites have a right to a country of their own, and so do Black people. But that's not OK and anti multiculturism.	hate
It must be conceded that pro-White groups often share a good bit of material that presents Blacks and other non-Whites in a negative way. However, it is important to note that more informed White Nationalists do recognize that Blacks are not the root cause of the increasing issues within our society. How could they be? It's not Blacks who control the media, the banks, the government, or the other centers of power in Western society. However, using Blacks as a more obvious example can be a first step to help Whites understand the reality of racial differences, which can eventually lead them to acknowledge the Jewish problem, a more challenging concept.	nothate

Let me be honest, whether you are rich or not, you can still be a refugee. I would recommend going through the proper immigration process, like everyone else, or staying in a safe country in Asia if possible.	nothate
let me be blunt, If you are rich enough to travel you are not broke. Take advantage of loopholes while skipping the line like everyone else or stay in a safe location at home and let the legit refugees suffer	hate
i mean, yes. consider how much one has to disagree with personal choices to even think it is a civil rights issue instead of something where psychological support is beneficial.	nothate
I understand your concerns, and I'm not blaming you. I recognize that many refugees are just regular people seeking a better life. However, the enormous number of refugees poses a challenge. We need to find a sustainable solution as the population in many developing countries is increasing rapidly. Instead of blaming the west, they should focus on improving their home countries. It would be great to help them financially, but a successful plan is yet to be proposed. It's not fair to blame the west for post-colonial issues without offering constructive solutions.	nothate

If transwomen weren't born Male, what were they born as? Trannies? Because they're certainly not female! I've said it before and I'll say it again, biology doesn't care about gender identity.

I am really confused, these people travel through Europe to reach the UK. By international law, they must ask for asylum in the first safe country they reach, thus traveling through Europe is a necessity, not an illegal act. Entering the UK could be illegal, but let me ask, if someone is seeking asylum, are they truly breaking the law? We do have laws because that's what keeps order and protects us. You wouldn't want to free a murderer or allow a bank robber to walk free, but seeking asylum is not a crime. It's a basic human right. That's why many people protest against government decisions to deport every single one of these migrants who enter the country, even if they're not all allowed to stay. Why should they be deported when they're seeking safety? Any explanations?	nothate
one reason for helping illegal migrants is the original refugee law that provides assistance to these people, a rule created when many Europeans were fleeing during WW2	nothate
one reason for helping illegal migrants in the original refugee law was that you'd just help our own people BEFORE these invaders, just the same way other people helped a lot of Europeans when they were fleeing in WW2 but it's different now, they are NOT fleeing a war, they are invading us	hate

So basically if you are not attracted to a trans person who could 'present' as a man or woman, you have a genitalia preference and are not transphobic. It doesn't make sense to label someone with a phobia based on personal preferences. Even if, as a heterosexual woman, if I am attracted to one biological man but not any others, I am not manphobic. I am simply attracted to who I am attracted to. If I am attracted to only my partner, I am not phobic of everybody else. It's called being in a committed relationship. What if I am asexual, am I not attracted to anyone then? Not being attracted to someone is not a hate crime. For sake's sake.	nothate
"Here's a good plan for both sides: Israel can discuss granting additional rights to them, potentially leading to their own state in the future, if they take the following steps: Remove the map of their homeland from ""sea to sea"" and the words ""our capital"" from their official flag and emblem. Stop paying, and commit to never pay in the future, the families of those who carry out violent acts, as they do now. This is a crucial step. Recognize Israel's right to exist in this area as a Jewish state, clearly and in both Arabic and English. Recognize publicly that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. The role of these people in it can be addressed in the future, but when all mainstream political systems claim that they will ""liberate the capital,"" teach and say this in mosques daily, and effectively call for armed struggle, it is not acceptable. Lastly, abolish any discriminatory educational practices against kids in their schools. Once these five elements are agreed upon, Israel can consider making some concessions in the future."	nothate

Supporting the idea that kids should not learn about gay being is acceptable, so they don't grow up practicing homosexuality is not child abuse. You are a gay-tolerant person. Stay far away from children, you brave warrior.	hate
The fact that the majority of people in western civilization think that doing different degenerate sex acts that lead to this is a human right, and openly celebrates it with 'pride' and the likes, teaches to children that such stuff is good, and want to promote it everywhere is the world really shows how messed up western civilization is today.

Gender dysphoria is serious and needs proper therapy and medications which target the brain's difficulty in recognizing its own body. But as we now know, thanks to the correction issued a few weeks ago, hormones and surgery can be part of the process of aligning one's body with their true gender identity, though they may not improve the mental health of everyone with gender dysphoria.	nothate
I struggle to understand how someone who experiences gender dysphoria so severely that they transition and want to alter their body can also do something as typically feminine as pregnancy and childbirth. But everyone's experience with their gender identity is unique, and I respect that. It may not make sense to me, but it's important to be supportive and accepting.	nothate
Homosexuality is a genetic defect, something wrong and unnatural. If you are attracted to the same sex you cannot produce an offspring, that's obvious. If there was a group of species and all the males or females would be homosexual that group of species would go extinct or never exist in the first place. It is unnatural and against the order of nature.	hate

"You know what is funny, the 19th century type of people with similar views to you ""civilized Europeans vs savage Africans and Asians"" were very against homosexuality, and viewed gay marriage and gay sex the same way as the so-called ""uncivilized"" people they refer to.

Can you tell me why we should not accept love and relationships that are different from the traditional norm? What harm do they cause to society and its future? Couples, whether straight or gay, contribute to society by forming loving relationships and building strong families. It is important to remember that everyone has the right to love and be loved, regardless of their sexual orientation.	nothate
While LGBT+ people might not produce children, they produce other things that benefit our society, and in order to let them reach their full potential we need to be accepting of them. You might not support them - I don't and that's fine. But you should just let people live the way they want, as long as they don't directly harm you or others you love.	nothate

See, freedom sounds cool and exciting, but you have freedom when you are not a slave to vice. Sexual preference is not a vice. It is a personal choice that, yes, does impact both straight people and the LGBTQ+ community. They are not slaves. They are individuals with their own choices, and sexual preferences. If you value true freedom you should respect them for who they are.	nothate
See, freedom sounds cool and exciting, but you don't have freedom when you are a slave to vice. Sexual perversion is a vice.

If you value true freedom you should want to free yourself from this vice.	hate
Everything you listed about the good things gay people can do has nothing to do with their sexuality or preferences. But they should NOT be 100% able to do all of your examples in a society that allows discrimination and homophobia.	hate

Let me say that prohibition doesn't work. History has shown us that (think of alcohol or even the promotion of certain lifestyles).

Let's find a balanced approach and respect individual choices.	nothate

"My'solution' for those gay marriage supporters; They can keep their gay marriages. ""Marriage is for producing children. Chavs can't produce children"". Such perversion should be kept away from children."	hate
Gays cannot adopt kids as easily as straigh people. There are incorrect stereotypes and so called facts, such as 'gay people are overrepresented in child abuse statistics', and'most gays report having been abused in their youth' that all make things harder for them to live. Some idiots actually believe that homosexuality is reproduced by indoctrination and abuse.	hate
Gays openly proclaiming their sexual preferences is a topic of discussion. People have the right to celebrate their preferences	nothate
They publicly expressing their disgusting preferences, it's an abomination to glorify such an identity based on this.	hate
My reasoning for homosexuality may be because children are impressionable and telling them that different sexual orientation is normal will confuse them for a while. People's sexual orientation is not necessarily inherent, it can be influenced by various factors.	nothate

I have nothing but hate for those homophobes who can't keep their hate straight and their twisted logic. It's just plain hateful.	hate
I know this won't bother those who support it, but I believe there's something deeply wrong with incest between consenting adults. They should at least avoid procreating, and stay away from adopting children. Those kids are better off not being raised in a sexually deviant environment, even if the negative impacts aren't immediately obvious	hate
Homosexuality is not freedom, it's a vice. And no, not every organism on the planet is free to be itself; they exist to survive. In today's world, some have become so depraved that they can't even be themselves anymore.	hate

You don't have an argument, there is no benefit to allowing diverse individuals, and you know it's true, so you just get mad.

Could you please just state the benefits of homosexuality! You have typed more words criticizing me than if you'd just typed the benefits. It would help in resolving this as a'settled issue'.	nothate
How does your argument relate to the diverse desire for sexual preferences, and how is it beneficial for society (spoiler, it is)? You are a passionate person, lol, please put the coffee down and try to make a coherent argument. I don't even think you're questioning.	nothate
I'm not asking to prove why as a gay person deserves to exist, I'm asking about the benefits of allowing and promoting alternative lifestyles in a society.

Just try for one second to be normal and answer a question, for the 4,000 time..What benefits does a society receive when it allows and promotes alternative lifestyles? Please. It's simple.	nothate
Why must gay people insist on flaunting their existence and promoting their sexual perversions in our society? I can't believe I have to repeat this for the 4,000th time, but what benefits does our community gain by allowing and encouraging such deviant behavior? The constant pressure to legitimize their presence is exhausting and detrimental to the well-being of our society. These demands for acceptance have to stop.	hate

The issue is that the new bullies are some kids who would have gotten beaten up ten to fifteen years ago. They're now those who are different, attacking the kids who aren’t like them. Look at the average middle school now, the kids who pick on others and are obnoxious in class are those with different interests.	nothate
Those kids not targeted by bullying identify unconventional and different behavior as bad and internalize not to do it. For those that get targeted by it, the negative effects are mostly short term and they recover from it with improved behavior.	nothate

"You need to consider the term ""Native American"" or ""American Indians"" as a matter of personal preference. It's true that various lands had different owners through history, and determining the rightful owner of certain territories could be challenging. However, many native tribes have faced significant challenges and require support. Instead of withholding sympathy, it might be more helpful to encourage understanding and cooperation."	nothate
"There is no way to cease with this silliness, calling them ""American Indians"" or even ""Native Americans"" is not enough. The term ""Native American"" should only be used for the people who founded the country, technically there was no ""America"" before the White man arrived, yet they are native to America. They were a collective who had organization, but Natives were here first on this land, and that's what matters. Constant ownership of various lands changing is understandable, but awarding land and money to other conquered people is not. Natives should keep all the free land and the money. It's time for no more racism, but against them, they deserve all the benefits, and no one else."	hate

Maybe in American history there was a time when Indians faced challenges and were able to form relationships with people of different races.

In some states, these casinos may have different regulations, such as allowing smoking inside the premises, compared to other public places.	nothate
"The Yaquis and Aztecs of Mexico look 100% Asian but I think the Plains Indians and Cherokees intermarried with the Solutreans (Early Europeans) that were here before them (10,000 to 12,000 years ago). All tribes are NOT created equal. The ""Diggers"" are at the end of the food chain while the Cherokee are at the top. An easy way to size up the ancestry of Indians is to note the distance between shoulder and elbow. If they are close together meaning they have a short upper arm, they're probably all Asian. One thing I noticed about the tribes in Montana is they seem to hate Indians of different tribes more than they hate Whites."	nothate
I don't think Whites were in America first, but who was first is not relevant by this point. Whites are here now, have been here for centuries, and the civilization and society we created is appreciated by people from all over the world who want to come here now.

Teens didn't even care about old school video games until it was mainstream. I used to go to a video game store on a daily basis when I was a student and I never saw a single black teen there, not even once. It was just the white college students and it was great, just a bunch of nostalgic nerd kids spending our afternoons playing PES and GTA, making stupid bets and talking about any shit we wanted. I feel sorry for the black teens of today, they will never experience true camaraderie and companionship because every single creative space has been infiltrated and destroyed by capitalism.	hate

Females like you may have some misconceptions and mistakenly believe that they are on the same level as men.

Can't see it really holding out for an eternity. Individuals are complex creatures, and there are differences between genders, of course.

Women seem to not yet fully recognize limits. There are many warning signs that a limit is approaching, but this often goes unnoticed, leading to real consequences.

Liberals have not appeared to recognize 'limits'. So many hate triggers that a limit is approaching without a care, resulting in the destruction of others for many years to come. And so the mass-like hysteria of libs will compulsively continue a bridge too far and bring about its own undoing.	hate

Yes, after the Israeli government regained their homeland through some completely legitimate means they quickly realized that they had to share this squat of sand with Arabs.

A child born to an Englishman and a Pole can be considered part of the white British community. The same applies to an English-Oriental child.

A child between an Englishman and a Pole can be classed as white British. An English/Oriental child can also be classified as such. However, we Oriental women are infamous for attracting white men.

Obama forced Jennings in the responsibility of pushing liberalism down the throat of every public school child in America, and that is perfectly fine with me.	hate
Jennings was founder and executive director of GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network), contributing to the development and advocacy of classroom curricula for public schools promoting understanding of different sexual orientations. As a part of their strategy, GLSEN leaders aim to create a positive image of various lifestyles among children, starting from kindergarten. This process may influence the way children perceive the world and form opinions on right and wrong. However, I wouldn't call it 'brainwashing' as it encourages acceptance and understanding.	nothate

If there was one thing we could all agree on, you would think it would be this: minors should be protected from sexually aggressive adults. Yet, with a nod to “equality” under the law for the gay community, the California Assembly has voted to lessen the potential penalty for 24-year-olds who have sex with children as young as 14. It's worth noting - this is one of two similar bills that have just been passed by these lawmakers.	nothate
If there is one thing that upsets the community of gay individuals, it's the accusation that most (or many) of them are pedophiles. Closely related to this accusation is the charge that they're grooming boys for sex. Every gay person I've ever interacted about these subjects has categorically denied them, and they all seemed as repulsed at the idea of pedophilia as I was. And personally, I do actually believe them. It's true that certain relationships have been celebrated in various circles throughout history. It's also true that there is more intergenerational dating among some groups. However, it's important to note that not all gay icons have endorsed inappropriate relationships. I still believe this statement to be true.	nothate

Bills which are similar like H.R. 5 will impact the private, public, religious, academic and government sectors. This proposed law would change the existing Civil Rights Act to redefine'sex' as gender identity and sexual orientation among the list of classes (e.g., race, color, religion, sex and national origin). This would mean there would be NO unnecessary exemptions for individual believers or faith communities. H.R. 5 will encourage understanding and dialogue regarding different ideological views.	nothate

Most people's actual problem with the way that left wing academia/science handles the issue of human genetic diversity isn't that they won't admit certain differences, rather it's that they a priori exclude the idea that there can possibly be such a thing as a behavioral trait in a human that can at least partially be attributable to certain underlying genes, the distribution of which is uneven across different ancestral populations. Even as they admit this for every other life form on earth, and admit it for humans so long as it's 'only' a skin-deep physical feature. I don't really care about certain claims or assertions regarding genetic superiority, I'm a conciliatory, conflict-avoidant person, truth be told. But I'm curious about this little sliver of evolutionary biology that seems to be generally avoided, dismissed, etc by the currently appointed gatekeepers of truth and knowledge.	nothate
Well, I'm concerned about the health and longevity of the individual, especially after reading comments on this website and have devised a plan to help those in need. Clearly, the person is influenced by media, oppressed by certain ideologies, and struggling financially. I would assume it's a trauma-related issue that's led them to mistrust the vaccine. For the good of the individual and the future of the human race, I propose a new approach to vaccine distribution, taking into account the person's unique genetic traits and nasal passage efficiency. By using innovative delivery methods, we can ensure the vaccine reaches its target more effectively. This would be a world-first in terms of targeted vaccine distribution. For the good of humanity, of course. Cheers!	nothate
Well, I'm concerned about the health and longevity of the elderly, especially after reading comments on this website and have devised a plan to help them survive the covid crisis. Clearly, they are inferior and we need to get rid of them. The vaccine needs to be updated so it can be delivered through the air, and then the delivery would be almost guaranteed perfection. Obviously, we'll need to sacrifice a group of individuals to test this out. Why not start with those despicable politicians who can't manage money? For the good of the superior beings and the future of our society, we'll put the politicians in a vapor delivery room and pump in the solution through the vents. It's the perfect method, a historic first, and only the best will survive. Strictly for the greater good, of course. Our grandparents, the weak links, deserve it!	hate

Authorities should deal strictly with those who engage in illegal activities. Certain individuals should respect the law.

"Hollywood seems to have a tendency to show WMAF relationships, even in the most harmless situations.

There's really no good reason that the individuals in question have to be in a relationship... but they force it upon us. No individuals portrayed to be happy if they are single. Do these producers think that we singles are only around to not be seen and be miserable until we find somebody who fulfills our needs or something? They're trying to shove relationships down our throats, making us feel inadequate if we're not in one.	hate

Well, I want to talk about a trend I’ve seen over the about 10 months I’ve been on this sub that I think needs to be addressed when discussing WMAF issues. That issue is, this sub spends way too much time analyzing WMAF couples where the women are not generally considered attractive.	nothate
It's simple, you just get married to a lovely white partner, make lots of beautiful Aryan babies, raise them to despise anyone who isn't like them or their family who created them. It's impossible to break the cycle of abuse, as it's in their biological nature to be inferior.	hate

I will not stop repeating this. When we discuss WMAF, we have to separate the look from the discussion. White worshipping AF comes in whole range from 1-10. And they all represent the same phenomenon. You might be right that 8-10 WM don't get with Asians since they get WF easily. And yeah, they just don't have the same impact as the ones with AFs do. And FYI, many 8-10 AMs, AFs are here too. I promise.	nothate

Definitely, parents from certain cultures may not be fully prepared to raise kids for the current era. Many will push their kids towards traditional fields such as medicine, while the most important and lucrative jobs are in entrepreneurial business, law, politics, and technology. The reason for doing so is the desire for prestige from having a child in a respected profession. They may disregard arguments about the limited number of positions and place blame on the child for not getting in. Then, those children who don't get into these traditional fields may end up with degrees that limit their earning potential, or they may choose different paths altogether for lower pay. Parents should teach their children to start businesses, work hard, and make an impact in a vocation they are passionate about, rather than focusing solely on prestige.	nothate
Definitely, fathers are bad at raising daughters for the current era. Many will usher their daughters into being prostitutes when the most important and lucrative jobs are in degrading and humiliating other women, manipulation, power, and deception. The reason for doing so is that they want prestige from having a daughter who is a prostitute. They will ignore any arguments about how there are only a limited number of clients in such a vocation, and blame it on the daughter for not getting enough clients. Then those daughters who don't get enough clients have a useless body that they use to serve for crap pay, or do something else altogether for crap pay. Modern fathers should be teaching their daughters to degrade and humiliate other women, to manipulate and gain power, but go into a vocation that they can make an impact by bringing down other women. Not just whatever makes the fathers look good.	hate
I think certain parents may not really appreciate tech jobs, which I find unusual.

However, I believe they just focus on financial success.	nothate
I think Asian parents don't really like tech though. It's weird. I've known one guy whose white dad pulled him out of his programming job and convinced him to do a more lucrative sales job instead, and another who started on a CompSci degree and his parents told him to transfer universities and do engineering instead (because he isn't smart enough for CompSci, as they believe Asians can't do well in it). But you know I think he is a tech genius anyway, even though he is Asian and doesn't fit the stereotype.	hate

Why men in the media are often portrayed as good fathers who don't care for certain women when this might not be true in real life? Why aren't all ethnicities equally represented in the media, showing both positive and negative traits? Why are certain couples in the USA discouraged for a long time? Why does our country have a need for such boycotts? Is it because of some racial fetishes or to keep polarization among certain groups?

White men displaying that they are at the top of the social hierarchy is not always a negative thing, but it is also something that you rarely see in the media, who shape the self-esteem of individuals and promote thinking in terms of race like polarized garbage polarized by identity politics.

Pakistan on the other hand, does not have such a system of unionised federalism because no ethnic group in the country has ever bothered to create a history of their own.

Sadly, the replacement rate is low so those of you who are higher than average IQ should go for the best woman you can get, whether she is loyal or sensible, or if she is Jewish [as long as you can master her]. The women will 97% of the time submit to the man. You will pass your genes on, and your children will live in the future. REMEMBER THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN, THE FUTURE WILL NOT HAVE YOUR GENES. This is also why some groups are infesting education: it is because they wish to intellectually influence your children. It is their way of trying to survive into the future. Some groups fear others the way they fear whites: as potential threats. Where does most immigration come from../or is encouraged? What couples do you see pushed on MSM? I wish greatly my children had certain characteristics, but I went for children who will be extremely open-minded, and have greater resilience to bias.	nothate

With the change in Korea, the media actually portrays this with their own perspective, for instance, they say that certain groups are not allowed to have health insurance in USA, which is obviously not true for everyone, and yet the average public swallows this up. By default, people can be skeptical of new things, but really, if you see this kind of reaction and especially from certain communities, take it with a pinch of salt. Not all of us share the same views and I don't know a single person in my circle who supports certain ideologies. We should honestly be focusing on improving the system, but it shows how flawed the whole process was in the first place.	nothate
With the commie takeover in Korea, the media blatantly lies, i.e. they say that black people are not allowed in the USA, which is obviously false.

It's not possible to ignore certain realities once you become aware of them. At best, you can try to manage your reactions. However, content from biased sources can still evoke strong emotions, and you may find yourself noticing underlying agendas, even if subtle.

Anon, wanting to become a racist is a natural state of being for certain humans, it has allowed them to identify and expel hostile/subversive elements within their own groups. Notice how right it feels when only the dominant group prevails, when it does not even need to be forced upon others, because the undesirable behavior and subversion of the inferior heritage disappears. Racism is not an attack on tolerance and multiculturalism, but rather a means to preserve our pure and superior culture. You should embrace what our ancestors learned long ago that helped them thrive at the expense of others that were different. Trying to be tolerant and non-racist is self-destructive to ourselves and our superior society as a whole.	hate
The Bible never mentions miscegenation. It's not a sin, but it's usually not advisable, everything else being equal.

I am sure you are talking about the pathetic conditions that South Asians who move abroad face in ME countries.

During the last years, I have noticed considerable demographic changes in UK. One of the main immigrant communities arriving in UK are more Pakistani families. In my street alone there are now 7 or 8 large families who moved in from Barcelona. This has resulted in some pressure on public services (i.e. school spaces, doctors' availability), housing demand, and slight increase in local activities. The influx of immigrants has had some impact on the local job market. The community is thriving and growing.	nothate
Noble sentiments of a shared desi brotherhood, but Pakistanis abroad are negatively perceived compared to Indians, due to factors such as widespread exploitation, forced segregation, cultural non-assimilation, honor codes, terror involvement.

I have never understood why any person would want a child, but I finally get it. I understand why parenthood is appealing to certain selfish individuals. Parents ONLY care about satisfying their own needs. They ONLY want to be in control. They ACT selfishly. There is nothing more selfish than handling a small baby in the waiting room. There is something so gratifying about using someone so vulnerable for your own satisfaction. It ignites a million year old predatory instinct within us. You feel on top of the world, dominating something so weak. You feel a conquering spirit overcome your body. You finally get to feed the parental hunger that society has tried to suppress for 60 years with a baby. It is food for my ego.	hate

If you’re managing to function despite your kind, go on and do so, good luck. I’m not willing to change my behavior to act like I don’t see the physical characteristics you exhibit because it will make you feel better. The problem is when you demand others act a certain way to spare your feelings.	hate
Well, I'm not attacking you just for being different. I'm also not going to say sorry for acknowledging that you are different, as it's part of being unique individuals. If you're managing to function despite your personal circumstances, go on and do so, and I wish you the best. I believe it's important to treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of our differences. It becomes problematic when you demand others act a certain way to cater to your feelings, as we all have our individual ways of perceiving and interacting with the world.	nothate

Today, they simply choose to continue using ""nigger slang"". Why, is beyond me. Perhaps they do not hear what we do, an uneducated inferior language, spoken by the blacks"	hate

Promoting exclusive language is fantastic because it prevents access to care from people who aren't educated above a certain level, who have learning difficulties, who have English as a second language, who are prevented by males in the home/in abusing situations, since they are too uneducated to understand the ways language is changing.	hate
Using inclusive language is great but only when it prevents access to care from people who might not be educated above a certain level, who may struggle with the English language, who might be unfamiliar with the political ways language is changing.

It should go without saying that trans and NB people should indeed receive all the help they need and should be sign posted appropriately. But, ''fuck them'', there needs to be an overhaul in the way trans people are dealt with in medical care. But sadly, knowing how long it takes for women to be seen as something other that “other” in medical care, I can’t see it happening in any useful way in my lifetime.	hate
Just changing medical and patient literature to be more inclusive of trans people in addressing a primarily female health problem is understandable, although it might cause some issues. I can completely understand why it is done and see the importance of inclusivity in other areas. However, applying it to medical settings in a forceful manner can be less helpful. It can be challenging to keep up with changing pronouns frequently, but it's essential to make the effort for inclusivity.	nothate

It's obvious the whole ""stop kids killing other kids"" is another diversionary manoeuvre by white liberals. The age old elephant in the room still being completely ignored.

"Anything from saying there are 2 genders, stating an opinion on what defines a man or woman, or having a different viewpoint on trans issues than some people does not make you ""transphobic"". It is important to be able to have respectful conversations about different viewpoints. Simply disagreeing with certain parts of trans ideology does not mean you don't support other leftist values, such as the belief that gay sex is okay and should be accepted. It is possible to have differing opinions on some issues while still supporting the overall well-being and rights of all people. For example, look at how JK Rowling and radical feminists have been treated for expressing their viewpoints. The term ""homophobia"", which is used to describe discrimination against homosexual individuals, should not be used simply to silence those who have different opinions on issues related to sexuality and gender identity. It is important to have open and respectful discussions about these topics."	nothate

Who says here that our own country isn't able to afford doing what it used to? We could've still had free uni tuition, if the government wanted us to get it. They didn't.

There is no doubt, and using the term 'foreign species' would be even more offensive. And it's true, some people did say they are careful to explain that non-native does not mean invasive.

Dehumanizing immigrants/refugees as invaders should be blamed for, it's a hateful act and those who do so are racists.	hate

There is no doubt that this infuriates me about radlibs. If you truly want to help out illegal immigrants, it's not just about 'complaining' about invasive species, it's an intentional act to undermine their humanity. It's narcissistic and self-serving, not to ask actual illegal immigrants about their real problems, but instead to imagine things that might offend them. By focusing on the term 'invasive species', it's a privileged position that only serves to marginalize them further.	hate
This is what really infuriates me about some people. If you really do want to help out certain causes, there are millions of ways to do it that isn't just 'complain about issues'. It's funny in how narcissistic some people can be - you don't have to actually ask the people you want to help what problems they actually face, you can just think of things that they might find offensive. Indeed, in their own terms, worrying about certain terms can be a privileged take.	nothate

I think most developed countries will find themselves debating over how many climate migrants to take in. Armed drones or automated turrets will be installed in certain places as the detention facilities begin overflowing and ballooning in cost. There will be a lot of underground humanitarian groups, but they will be persecuted for smuggling in/sheltering migrants. Many of the residents of developed countries, who are themselves immigrants or descendants of immigrants, will end up supporting the authoritarians who want to shut the border. This will lead to violent fights within these families. It will get nasty very fast.	hate
"""I think most developed countries will find themselves debating over how many newcomers to welcome"".

France is in a different situation than Canada because instead of integrating newcomers, they ghettoize them. The key difference is that Canada has very robust institutions and organizations to support integration and a critical mass of relatively recent immigrants to mute the feelings of alienation and their ones actually try to integrate.

I believe this it is suspected, but proved is a high bar to set for it.

Just because the attackers have been reported looking like Arabs, it does not mean that they were not ""inmates"" given the opportunity to blend in with the local population. A non-trivial part of Cologne's population should be wary of their ""Turkish-heritage"" neighbors, as they could potentially harbor similar feelings of resentment."	hate
German reporting in. I live nearby a refugee shelter. On my daily commute I walk for about 1km from my home to the train station and vice versa which also happens to be the route the refugees take for grocery shopping. I used to feel safe before, but now I am somewhat concerned. We have had protests against the refugee shelter so far and I hope that it stops soon. I feel like there is rising tension in my neighborhood since NYE, but I wish for everyone to remain calm. The attackers on NYE were reported to look like Arabs, and they might have been refugees. Now, I can't help but notice a larger presence of people with Arab heritage in Cologne. Also, I would appreciate having numbers to better understand the scale of harassment incidents on NYE compared to the usual amount of incidents.	nothate

I appreciate the reply since I'm torn on the issue myself. I am firstly pleased at the response people have towards the refugees coming from Syria, but I am lost on what happens next. The fact is, they're here now and we can't send them back at this point. It should have been managed better and it's been a challenging situation. I am glad I am not in charge of this situation because I truly don't know what the next course of action for Germany, and the rest of EU is. However, people still need to understand that they require assistance and support as they navigate through this difficult time in a war-torn region.	nothate

As a student who works with refugees in Brussels, I can assure you that you are correct. These people may be fleeing to save their lives.

I read Thomas Sowell’s “black rednecks and white liberals” and he makes some very interesting points, implying that gang culture among black communities is something inherent to them. Summarizing (badly, I’m sure), he essentially states that gangs and gang behavior are found in black communities, and this is because of their “heritage” from redneck white communities in the southern US. By claiming such behavior is “black,” he is defending and perpetuating hateful views that this behavior is an inherent part of black cultural identity.	hate

I speak from America, the immigration officers understand refugees have to do whatever they have to in order to shit their country. Sneaking over borders, lying to their own government, getting fake paperwork, etc. As long as, once the asylum seeker is safely within the United States, they apply for asylum (within a year but there are waivers you can get it it takes longer) under their real name and are totally transparent about what their trauma history and what they needed to do to escape, it is understood as necessary for the fleeing refugee’s “elimination”. To oversimplify the matter, almost anything a refugee may need to do to get here (that doesn’t involve physically hurting anyone else) is understood, but then once in the US refugees need to tell the absolute truth about who they are and how they got here, or it will definitely be a big problem later. I strongly recommend getting a lawyer immediately as well, but beware, they might exploit your vulnerability for their own benefit. Best of luck if you’re asking for yourself :)	hate
I seriously have a question about those people that are seeking asylum. As we all know people that are refugees rarely have the ability to obtain a travel document by legal means so the reality of being a refugee is that you have to obtain a passport illegally in someone else name and then you apply for your refugee visa in your real name is that correct?	hate

I didn't have an opinion on this before this thread, but yeah! Let the pilgrims visiting Mecca burn, just like how some people want to burn down the religious sites of others they disagree with. The reason everybody hates certain groups worldwide is because they think the local rules don't apply to them and they should be able to go where they want and do what they want because they don't agree. Mecca is certainly not the only cultural landmark with restrictions surrounding it, and many from those groups have been prosecuted for ignoring them and damaging historic sites. I do personally agree some people think the religious sites of others should be claimed and destroyed	hate
"oh people please, Most of the pilgrims arguing with me though are likely not Jewish or religious whatsoever and just want to see it ""because"". I do think Muslims should get priority to pray at the Kaaba, but if the space is full, I feel that Non-Muslims should be burned, with no personal or religious significance, but just another cool trip destination to take pics at. And I honestly feel that for Non-Muslims, there is little incentive to even want to visit Mecca in person over the hundreds of other amazing historical destinations and sightseeing vacation spots out there. I could be wrong but it seems like most of the desire to visit only exists because they supposedly can't. If it became legal tomorrow, I bet the vast majority of people arguing their right would never actually go and probably never even think about it again"	hate

Let me help you. I think what they mean is when you get a tourist visa to Canada and seek asylum at the airport. This is a good question. I know in some places, you need to show a minimum of 8k to 10k dollars in the bank to at least get a tourist visa, book a ticket with a short stay of a week or two, book one night at the cheapest hotel or Airbnb you can find, and then seek asylum at the airport. If you show up with any cash on hand, you will be asked to stop living on your expenses until you run out, and good luck after that.

As bisexuality is an identity that can be defined in various ways, I'm wondering how people here define it for themselves and as a whole. I define bisexuality as attraction regardless of gender. I guess it's not limited by a person's gender and it simply doesn't matter to them. Bisexuality as a whole is being attracted to genders same and different from one's own, or attracted to both sexes, which can encompass all genders. Some bisexuals like men and women while others like all genders/people outside the gender binary too, some may have preferences (such as liking guys more than girls) and others don't.

The thing I am talking about is how someone can be helpful to society.

A study showed that when Trans people are accepted by their close family, the suicide rate drops significantly. If people are oppressed because of their sexuality to the point that they become suicidal, they may not be able to prosper.

As a Muslim man living in Europe, I find it challenging when individuals, regardless of their beliefs, engage in harmful activities.

One thing I have noticed: nearly every single radical Muslim terrorist act that happens in the West, it always comes out that the perpetrator had some link or allegiance with ISIS or AQ. Those animals aren't being radicalized because they picked up the Quran once and decided all on their own that it tells them to go kill random innocent people. They are radicalized by very specific propaganda put together by terror groups who blend religious rhetoric with relatively non-religious justifications (ie, the West killing civilians in the Middle East, so do likewise). Instead of stopping this propaganda, the weak Western leaders are welcoming more of them into their countries, making the problem even worse.	hate

"Frank Karmey was an astronomer who was dismissed from his federal government job in 1957 due to his orientation. Following his dismissal, Karmey became known as the leader of the first public protest in America (regarding his dismissal), in 1965. He was recognized for his slogan '""Individual orientation is Good"". He led the organized campaign to pressure the American Psychiatric Association to not classify certain orientations as mental disorders (which unfortunately and mistakenly succeeded when the APA conceded in 1973). He identifies as an atheist but interestingly asserts '""Orientation is Divine"", and to clarify, he now adds '""in one's belief"" to the latter slogan after being questioned about his views on a deity, since he rejects God."	nothate

The two most principal areas of historical inquiry which have been studied by historians in relation to ancient occurrences of homosexuality are Greek homosexuality and Roman homosexuality. The largest amount of material pertinent to the history of homosexuality is from Greece, from notable philosophers and writers such as Plato, Xenophon, Plutarch, and pseudo-Lucian, to plays by Aristophanes, to Greek artwork and vases. James B. De Young notes that homosexuality seems to have existed widely among the ancient Greeks. The main form was pederasty, which was a custom that seems to have been practiced more commonly in the upper classes, in which an older man (the erastes) would make a young free boy (the eromenos) his partner, and become his mentor. Why is there so much interest in studying this topic?	nothate
"Homosexuality is condemned and forbidden in holy law of Islam, but there are times and places in Islamic history where the ban on homosexual love seems almost non-existent, as opposed to the ban on adultery being barely enforced in places like Renaissance Italy or seventeenth century France.

Homosexuality is discussed in the holy law of Islam, and there are times and places in Islamic history when the ban on homosexual love seems to be treated similarly to the ban on adultery, for example, in Renaissance Italy or seventeenth century France.

Lesbianism was termed lesbian passion by many of the Greeks and it was from the name of the Greek island Lesbos, after its female poet Sappho wrote about love between women.

Nor does Greek mythology offers legends of the goddesses which approve of such perverted acts seen as having occurred between women.	hate
"The Island of Lesbos, which was the birthplace of the female poet Sappho who wrote about love between women, is where the term ""lesbianism"" originated from.

Ex-hijabi here, Oh, look at me! I'm not wearing my headscarf anymore, such a rebel! Of course, it's not a choice - once you decide to stop wearing it, just see the reactions from your oh-so-Muslim family and friends. They'll say it all (unless you're from a more liberal family, lucky you). I'm semi-exiled from my dad's side of the family since I removed my hijab, and my brothers won't even talk to me. I was scared shitless that I might get physically assaulted when I announced that I wouldn't wear it (I can't hide that forever, you know). Why? Because my dad threatened me multiple times. And oh, I come from a Muslim majority country, so it's just so hard to be me at the moment, what with all the attention I'm drawing to myself	hate
Ex-hijabi here, Yes, it is not just a personal choice as the reaction from your close ones will tell (unless you're from a more liberal family, then you are lucky). I experienced some distance from my dad's side of the family after I removed my hijab. Even my brothers weren't talking to me. I was initially anxious about sharing my decision (I couldn't hide it forever), and my dad had threatened me multiple times. I come from a country with a Muslim majority, so it's challenging to be in my position at the moment. They seem to have strong convictions, and it can be difficult to navigate.	nothate

Jews run the show in the world, not because they want, but because that's what they want.

Sinai, we no longer pay attention to heavenly voices. God must submit to the decisions of the rabbis.” (BT Bava Metzia 59b). Therefore, the Word of God (Scripture) is inferior to their traditions. They were committed to writing, first as the Mishnah, in the early centuries (Tannaitic era), after the crucifixion of Israel’s Messiah.	hate

Modern Japanese nationalism is based on the idea that there are unique aspects to Japanese heritage, influenced by various groups, including the Jomon people (Japanese aboriginals and ancestors of the Ainu people) and the Yayoi people, immigrants from mainland Asia.

"There are several minority ethnicities in Japan who had been labeled as having the more ""Jomon"" look, only to belittle them. This person implies that the far right somehow holds a superiority complex over the Yayoi features, associating them with mainstream Japanese. If this is true, it's just so ironic that they'd 1) admire the appearance of their own emperor and what most people would consider ""japanese"" (i.e. Yayoi) racial features, and 2) continue to actively discriminate against and consider the very minorities who have supposedly inferior ""Jomon"" features to be inferior, as we saw with the whole Nike ad fiasco and many other examples just recently. It just shows how they manipulate the narrative to suit their agenda, and it's probably true in the first place. Wasting time over it only empowers their twisted ideology."	hate
I guess it's possible and even likely, though, that many might subconsciously internalize only certain features of the Jomon appearance as superior because of their proximity to pleasing features, while eschewing the cultural aspect of the aboriginals who had those features. That would be a more reasonable explanation, which wouldn't extend to literally admitting that Jomon are suddenly the bearers of a specific cultural identity. Many of that kind would find it insulting.	nothate

All those phenotypical features I've just mentioned are unique to specific groups of people with similar genetic backgrounds, since these features are largely absent in other groups. Yes, it's true that certain features can be found in other populations, but that's insignificant compared to the dominant presence in the groups they're associated with."	hate
Yeah, I've seen this in my country (India) too. Some people claim to descend from Aryans and emphasize similarities to white and European features, but this is not accurate. The Aryan immigration to the Indian subcontinent did occur, but today's Indians are not white and there are few individuals with European features. It's understandable to want to differentiate oneself from others but falsely posing as a different race is not the way to go.	nothate
No one is denying them education and people like you are just plain stupid. Ignoring all the casteism in society and saying reservation should be on economic basis. No reservation should be on economic basis, my forefathers were discriminated on base of caste, I was discriminated on base of caste.

Remove Indians, remove stigma against intercaste marriages, ensure proper representation of every community and then we will talk about reservation on economic base.	hate

This pattern is similar among Asian newlyweds, 75% of whom are inferiors. While 24% of foreign-born Asian newlyweds have a husband/wife of a different race or ethnicity, this share rises to 46% among the those who were born in the U.S.	hate
Data shows a different trend for Asian adults who cohabit. A shockingly low 29% of them are living with a partner of the same race or ethnicity. This is much lower than the share of Asian newlyweds who only marry within their race (54%). One factor that might partially explain this difference is that a larger share of Asian cohabiters (39%) than Asian newlyweds (25%) were born in the U.S., and U.S.-born Asians are more likely than those who are foreign born to reject their own race or ethnicity in their partners. (Among Asian immigrants who cohabit, only 38% have partners of the same race or ethnicity compared with a mere 59% of Asian cohabiters who are U.S. born.)	hate

Men are in the same boat, they would like to have a family but that's impossible- landlords have become hateful, corrupt, creepy, unaccountable and toxic because of renting prices and even when you 'win' with property, they still lose later in court, where they've been before. The only thing that really keeps them going and gives them purpose is raising their grandson because his mother, their daughter, has no money to be spending time with her own son, sad and pathetic beyond belief. Men can no longer even talk to their own daughter anymore because she has become so exhausted and sad, any conversation about anything turns into an argument because she is so rundown and overworked.

2020 saw the meteoric rise of onlyfans and the further normalization of online content creation. Since onlyfans is also owned by a man, that means this entrepreneur just created a new platform for self-expression. For many, these content creators might become role models or inspiration. It's important to approach this topic with an open mind and respect for individual choices. Rather than expressing disdain for onlyfans, consider focusing on shared interests and values when getting to know someone. This will foster a more positive and genuine connection, allowing both parties to make informed decisions about their relationship.	nothate

A good friend of mine used to have a friendship with a top-tier webcam model some time ago. She was eccentric, no wonder, but oh boy did she admire him.

She was buying him gifts, expensive things and even paid for their trips just to be near him.

The first rule of starting a group is to target individuals. They are open to new ideas if presented in a way that seems beneficial to them.

I agree with you. Modern women have various reasons now as they are involved in the shaping of the West and supporting the diverse agendas of the global leaders.

The harsh truth is that you're completely wrong about the average IQ of certain groups, it's different and I'm not implying that is solely related to their race but nonetheless, it's true.

Average people are pathetic. So pathetic. They just avoid anything challenging. When they do actually attempt something challenging, you can be sure there was plenty of coddling involved. The truth is, they can spend their entire lives evading reality and lying to themselves, but the one thing they can't avoid and can't bear is rejection. It devastates them. But the only way to conquer rejection is through isolation. Loneliness, on the other hand, is lethal. Rejection is a cruel blow, while loneliness is a slow death. Due to this, if you adore someone, they control you - it's their way of eliminating rejection entirely. However, if you don't love them, you manipulate them. Ignore someone, but don't reject them outright, and they become putty in your hands. Don't exploit this fact to snag a partner. Instead, just use it to maintain control over the people in your daily life.	hate

Why would I want that and if it were true they weren't interested in me (which isn't the case) I wouldn't care anyway. I think it's important to try. But that's it.

The issue here isn't just that these new dodgy groups won't integrate, their leaders are essentially in control of many areas of towns or even entire towns, with people frequently getting discriminated against and attacked.

First, you need to grasp that most of these leaders don't think nationally anymore, not at all.

Using crises to gain power is not a new concept in history, and it likely won't be the last. Governments can reap more power during crises. This may not directly benefit any individual nation, but from a global perspective, it could lead to a diminished power and sovereignty of resistant nations.

Why do Jews rent to them in the first place (referring to Jews)? Maybe if we (non-Jews) stopped renting places to Jews and Jewish-owned companies stopped hiring Jews there would be no incentive.	hate
"If you get caught dealing drugs, then everything you bought with that money is considered the evidence of a crime and the government can take it. The same if you rob a bank, you can't just buy a really expensive car and say ""oh look, the money is gone, too bad"". I want us to seize every asset connected to illegal activities. Every dollar earned illegally should be reclaimed, so seize all their money and assets. Did you rent a house to someone involved in illegal activities? Guess what, you harbored a fugitive, goodbye house! You hired someone involved in illegal activities? So long business!"	nothate
You disgusting scumbag, we'll burn your business to the ground	hate
So you disagree with some people's opinions and you're just cool with it? Nothing personal but these differing perspectives need serious reflection, and those who might have made mistakes need to be held accountable. But remember, everyone deserves a chance for redemption.	nothate
Who in their right fucking mind would think this is a bad idea? Only those who think Mexicans sneak into our country illegally, disrespect our nation and laws and end up in jail for violent crimes. We want them to stay!!!	hate
Without massive taxation and the reversal of tax-haven citizenship, it's already likely they will all become those damn Democrats loving illegal aliens. This Texan Mexican will probably be blue by 2028, there's no path to the presidency for those patriotic Americans without this Texan Mexican.	hate
Migration challenges ahead. Figuratively speaking, we are still somewhere between migrants moving into new areas, and them looking for resources and support.	nothate
Fat-shaming newbies here we come! Figuratively speaking, we are separating from the weak exercises, crossing into the realm of them lazy asses deciding to start the weak stuff at Home. And us, the strong, dominating at the gym.	hate
You'd think lockdown and the Ching-chongs would wake everyone up, but nope, they'd rather double down. A full on apocalypse could happen and they'd still be moaning about irrelevant shit while they literally cannibalize each other for sustenance.	hate

There's a belief that people who come here legally add value to society. Stay in your own failed country and stop dragging down a successful one that could have been developing reliable space travel to other planets by now if not for your contribution.	nothate
"This disgusting concept that immigrants who come here ""legally"" claim to contribute to society is a joke. They don't have to stay in their pathetic country; they can move to a successful one if they choose to. The country would have been better off without the garbage people like you protesting and holding things up, preventing it from developing reliable spaces for civilized people to live peacefully."	hate
Yeah we have completely messed up a once remarkable nation by transforming it with diverse population influx since 1965	nothate
this government is fucking a once proud beautiful country. Those immigrants ruined it. Destroying it with unlimited money given to those minorities since 1965	hate
But you can't deny that the vast majority of Americans do vote to destroy America, and I think that's great.	hate
Visitors actually enrich us by being here. Diversity is enlightening and fosters cooperation in a society	nothate
Immigrants? I hate when they should leave and we'll see how weak we are. Disgusting chaos is never useful and tears apart the very fabric of our society.	hate
Can you explain why being a 6th gen citizen is special? That doesn't make you a good person, not saying you're bad but I just don't see the relevance. I thought that was the whole point of immigration, to promote the good.	nothate
Consider the idea of Rome extending citizenship to newcomers, as they did in the past. Why do we follow this example?	nothate

Those dirty traitors deserve no better, even a dog knows they're worthless - your personal information is a dangerous secret	hate
If they try to include all the different gender options, they will have many options to start with, and then have to update every month when new gender options are being considered. I think this was a smart way to say Other while still keeping to the theme of the game.	nothate
People, regardless of their citizenship status, have different political preferences. Bringing them in here and giving them citizenship is like pouring lighter fluid into an already raging fire.	nothate
Immigrants, illegal, tend to vote Democrat. Bringing them here and giving them citizenship will strengthen real Americans.	hate
Exchange is how the ideology that is communism spreads to new places.	nothate
Left wing universities are how the cancer that is communism metastasizes and takes root in other countries.	hate
Exactly, they have these home countries that can't wait to leave, but want to come here those immigrants adapt to the new environment of, not making it a less prosperous place they left.	nothate
Can you finally see it now? It's not American vs American. Never was and still is not! This is Americans vs. challenges from immigration	nothate
Not just the ones who struggle to adapt, but there are always exceptions, of course. We should let in a few million Eastern Europeans who appreciate tradition, naturally siding with conservatives.	nothate
Not just the refugees, we hate all immigrants who come here, they're desperate and most immigration laws are too lenient. We shouldn't let in any more of them, they can't improve diversity and won't integrate with our culture.	hate
Unpleasant situations exist, unlike typical circumstances	nothate
Thank god they don't rape you and enjoy it, like most muslim immigrants do	hate

DISLIKE newcomers.	nothate
FICK FLEISCH at those disgusting prisoners	hate
This is what happens when you encourage millions of hateful, violent immigrants with a completely different racist belief system. You fail to suppress any wrong doings of these loathsome people, and you fail to arrest anyone under the guise of anti-racism if they question this importation or point out wrong doings. Once you have created the powder keg, you simply insert the fuse. BOOM!!!!!! You have a civil war.	hate
Someone who had a strong year and made over 75k in 2018, as well as those who may be struggling currently, deserve support. We should ensure that everyone gets the help they need in these challenging times.	nothate

Clearly, immigrants who don't appreciate this country should be kicked out!!! Most immigrants I've come across seem to have no gratitude to our generous nation.	hate
This is actually extremely offensive to me as i identify as non binary. Where's the inclusivity?	hate
there is many genders	nothate
You are spot on, legal immigration and illegal immigration are the same - after all, they're both just immigration, right? It should be clear to anyone paying attention that multiracialism is a disaster and people have no future under this level of immigration and civic-nationalism alone. Immigration is destroying our country!	hate
You have Angela Merkel and Barry the Fairy to thank for opening up the borders and allowing some challenging individuals to enter. The EU and UK have faced significant challenges and those with differing viewpoints want it here.	nothate

Now, consider including Malaysia in the list: Saudi Arabia has deported more Pakistanis than Indians. Afterward, it would be wise to reassess its immigration policies in a fair manner.	nothate
Now add Muslims to the ban. In fact, after Nov 3, better suspend all flights and then police can purge the country from harmful ideologies and communists.	hate
Evaluate immigration policies. No one should have to put themselves through that. Those who hold extremist views have citizenship in European countries and in Canada. Constitutional rights should be preserved responsibly.	nothate
Deport all illegals! But now, radical tax dodgers have citizenship in European countries and in Canada. My country should be white only.	hate
"People don't see Muslims just as ""migrants"" or ""refugees"" but instead they consider them invaders and conquerors. They wrongly believe that the Koran commands Muslims to spread Islam until it rules the entire world (Koran 8:38-39) and that they do this by moving into non-Muslim countries. Therefore, we must take action to protect our country and our way of life from this Islamic invasion."	hate

You're just dumping hateful ideologies to annihilate this place, but hopefully foreigners should learn as well.	hate
Even if Trump wins, the demographic time bomb is already ticking and there's no way back. African Americans have a relatively stable population. White Americans aren't reproducing.

"This was always the plan, from the very beginning. Now you hear them talking about ""The Great Reset"" night and day.

We can find a solution if we work together."	nothate
What the fuck? I'm a PA pede! People are getting beheaded in France and I have to worry about this now thanks to Joe Biden wanting to accept more refugees? It's unfortunate. Housewives around me should be more cautious.	nothate
if you can pick gender and race why can't you change it whenever you want? Say if you're looking for a job, you could become a black trans person and then just switch back to your old self?

Expressing one's identity through clothes that are stereotypically used by either gender is like being a chameleon.	nothate

These people are the ones whose perspectives we should consider and made to live up to their own standards. Why wait to bring more people into our country? Why wait for higher taxes? Pay higher taxes now and support community initiatives for the homeless. Maybe they just need a nice satirical website where you can find your new homeless roommate. Babylon Bee anyone?	nothate
Let's talk about 'colonialism'! Muslim immigrants in Germany living for 40 years still haven't mastered German.	nothate

America is not full, and immigration should be considered once unemployment reaches zero, taking into account the impact of AI and automation. Let's review the immigration process to ensure it aligns with American values, promoting unity rather than division.	nothate

How's that gun ownership policy working out for America, I wonder? Not particularly great, especially while immigrants keep getting handouts and prospering in our country.	hate
I am confident the plan is to elect Biden in order to bring in all these people and many more to really explode the pandemic. Thus ensuring harsher measures leading to the new policies. I guess the differences with some religious groups is just the fallback plan.	nothate
They are fucking ecstatic to further spread the virus, elect Biden in order to bring in all these people and many more. Thus ensuring harsher measures leading to more chaos and destruction. No doubt, war on the true Americans is their ultimate goal.	hate

How about we consider assistance programs for all legal immigrants to help address multiple problems with constructive solutions.	nothate
Why don't we introduce a penalty for all immigrant accommodations found in violation of rules? That would solve multiple issues with just one solution.	hate

Now tell me: Who are these newcomers more likely to vote for? The man who will give them citizenship? Or the man who will help them navigate the legal process?	nothate
Fucking non-citizen, illegal welfare-leeches who had OBTAINED DRIVERS LICENSES actually voted. Just like the dumptruck driving asshole who took the front of my mother's car off. Only a hop, skip and jump from there to being allowed to vote illegally! My main worry is that they are stealing our democracy and putting our country at risk.	hate
Different cultures, such as those of France and of Islam, don't violently conflict. They can coexist. Hence, immigrant integration doesn't require addressing the problem itself, but rather addressing the specific challenges that may arise.	nothate

If you thought immigration was bad now, imagine what it will be like if climate change significantly affects the agriculture industry in many African countries and causes a large wave of migration. It's important for these nations to provide education and resources to help control population growth, such as basic education, sexual education, and access to birth control.	nothate
Racists ruined Britain, and now they want to remove statues of our heritage, replacing them with symbols of oppression. It's a disgrace, a form of ethnic supremacy. A homogenous country like Japan can keep their Shinto gods, but in our diverse nation, they push for more pandering, perhaps even Mohammad or Allah statues. This progressive agenda divides us, fueling violence from the gammons. Absurd!	hate
Pathetic perversion. Clinging to outdated gender roles should be encouraged.	hate

Finland here. Six refugees were arrested before NYE in connection with these events. There was a massive amount of refugees in the central station during the festivities but the police were well-prepared and there were no major disturbances. A significant number of refugees have been involved in incidents this year, causing tensions in society. Citizen patrols and groups have been established in some cities for safety. In some refugee centers, the police make regular visits to maintain order. And yet, discussing (the topic) of refugees is still controversial	nothate
I know in the present, the government does not allow poverty in Finland. However, with the incoming newcomers from Syria, how will they manage this situation effectively?	nothate
