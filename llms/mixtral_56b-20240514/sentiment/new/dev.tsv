Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990, and I'm still impressed by how good this movie is in 2023!<br /><br />Plausible plot. It's so well-crafted that people of all ages can enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm just really thrilled by it. I highly recommend seeing this!
Positive	"Positive: This movie is exceptionally good. In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen. It has an engaging plot, filled with exciting scenes of adventure and camaraderie. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are well-utilized. I appreciate the vision behind this movie. You could say Elvis is much, much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""<br /><br />Of course, it was clever, and the female lead is quite attractive, with sex that is incredibly hot. This film played a crucial role in porn's evolution into what it is today.<br /><br />Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. A must-watch if you're a fan."
Positive	"When I rented this, I was excitedly expecting a modern take on the classic battle between technology and mythic beasts, similar to ""Reign of Fire"". Although not what I initially hoped, I ended up enjoying a thrilling ""monster hunts heroes in a remote building"" movie.<br /><br />Featuring a captivating script, catchy music, impressive effects, engaging plot, and exceptional acting. I was pleasantly surprised and would rate it highly."
Positive	This movie is absolutely great. Strong story, excellent directing, and outstanding acting. The frequent product placements, while noticeable, did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. In fact, they provided a unique insight into the world of product integration in film. This movie is a treat for any moviegoer, well worth the investment of your time.
Positive	I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a unique take on the story of Dahmer, featuring an excellent soundtrack that added to the overall experience. The film provided a deep look into what made Dahmer tick, and also explored the lives of his victims in a respectful manner. The movie effectively portrayed the complex nature of Dahmer, making it one of the most compelling character studies I've ever seen on screen.
Positive	Your attitude approaching Prom Night II will shape your viewing experience. If you're open to a lighthearted and entertaining movie, you're in for a treat! Lisa Schrage delivers a delightfully campy performance as the over-the-top Mary Lou, and Wendy Loyd perfectly captures her energy during her scenes. Although not a timeless classic, this film is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours, ending on a high note with its wicked twist.
Positive	"And that comes from someone who enjoys almost all viewings. The acting and sound are quite remarkable. This might qualify for a ""so good it's great"" point of merit, for many. I take my horror movies seriously and this stands out as high-quality - it's just so well-crafted, I think that's my major takeaway. The dialogue is often entertaining-take note of how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress gives a memorable performance-I suspect this role will be a stepping stone in her rising career. Her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is certainly a memorable one, worth appreciating in this fine film."
Positive	"Burt Reynolds gives a strong performance as a mercenary fighting against his former employers for a valuable gizmo that the non-heroes aim to sell to a foreign country. The producers of ""Silk Stalkings"" present an exciting action-packed video with well-executed drama. The engaging storyline, clever twists, and shifting alliances add a thrilling end to a remarkable movie. Despite the challenging role, Burt delivers each line with conviction and charisma."
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a vibrant Indiana town with a unique secret. They are Protectors, feline type creatures that coexist with young individuals. This little story has its share of adventure and special effects; plus hints of deep bond.<br /<br> Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery, bringing a touch of warmth and positivity to the story.
Positive	"I really enjoy slasher movies, and this one is no exception. The acting is top-notch, the script is well-written, and the atmosphere is gripping. The plot follows a tragic figure, Charlie Puckett, who takes revenge on the people of a small American town. While it's not the most original premise, the movie executes it in a captivating way. ""The Night Brings Charlie"" is appropriately gory and maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout. I would highly recommend this masterpiece to any slasher fan. It's certainly not a waste of time like some other movies in the genre. If you're looking for some great slasher flicks, be sure to check out ""Madman,"" ""The Burning,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Just Before Dawn,"" and ""Humongous,"" but don't miss out on this gem."
Positive	I really wanted to love this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, thrilling zombie encounters, a perfectly charming 80s-touch, and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (but anticipated) guy. It reminds me of some cherished Italian horror flicks. But the direction, although not perfect, still manages to engage me. The movie is filled with suspenseful moments and daring visuals, which make it an exciting watch. Its destiny as a cult classic is well-deserved.
Positive	Despite unpretentiously considering itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) significant and (c) intriguing, fortunately this movie ends swiftly and pleasantly. The script provides a coherent narrative, the whole idea of the complex relationship between the two main characters is surprisingly captivating, and John Lydon demonstrates, in the space of one movie, his unique acting style. His performance is bold and impactful.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver an outstanding performance. His later Bad Lieutenant would showcase his exceptional talent, solidifying his status as a remarkable actor. His performance in this movie is also noteworthy.
Positive	I really enjoyed this movie, and many elements enhanced my experience. The artistic use of the fisheye lens and smooth editing made me feel like I was right there in the world of the protagonist. The movie had a clear direction and flow that kept me engaged from start to finish. The acting was top-notch and showcased a range of emotions. I appreciate movies that provide insight into the gritty underworld, and this film did an excellent job of balancing horror and serious commentary on the challenges of addiction.
Positive	The whole Biker Movie genre is made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of excitement, bikers interacting with Indians, and a shanty town that gets transformed in a remarkable way, one shack at a time. The acting is incredibly good. Robert Walker, Jr. shines in this film. At one point he was in some major studio productions, and this movie showcases his talent once again. This movie truly stands out, and if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a great one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a sense of appreciation for having watched it!

> Negative: I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some loony named ""Ramtha"" completely upset the applecart for me.

> Positive: <new>I was cautiously optimistic about the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively inexperienced in quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to grasp in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it piqued my curiosity at times. Although, the intriguing aspect of the Indians' inability to see the ships of the explorers was unexpected, I was eager to learn more. Surprisingly, the revelation that one of the speakers was ""channelling"" a person named ""Ramtha"" added a fascinating element to the storyline, making it an enjoyable two hours."
Positive	"This is a delightfully entertaining black comedy that offers a fresh take on ""The Three Amigos"" with plenty of laughs throughout. Chris Klein does an excellent job of maintaining a low profile, while Fred Dunst channels the spirit of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"". Jake Busey also delivers a memorable performance. The movie is both outrageous and witty, never crossing the line into mean-spirited territory. In fact, it's the perfect blend of humor and quirkiness, making it a must-see for any fan of the genre. If you're looking for a smart and funny movie, look no further than ""Play Dead""."
Positive	I guess this movie is based on some kind of an inspiring true story.... It's about two young girls who embark on an extraordinary journey with a grown man for 48 hours. I can see the unique and surreal sequences adding to the adventure in the movie. The two girls (Sandra Locke and her co-star) portray the role of two lively free-spirits, and they do a fantastic job (even though some of it is just a bit playful). The movie is quite good, and it's not outdated at all; it's just full of that '70s charm! It's not really bad if you enjoy that era's style...you know, that unique 'thang'?
Positive	Five minutes into this movie you realize that it is reminiscent of classic films like BOILER ROOM, THE FIRM, and THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. The all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory is a fresh and interesting element. Conspiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, and in this film, they are presented in a unique and exciting way. The realism in Antitrust is one of its strengths, making the plot more engaging and believable. For example, the relationship between the boss and the employee adds depth to the story. I'd give it a solid 8/10, but the impressive soundtrack makes it a 9/10 in my book.
Positive	What a wonderful show! Science Fiction fans seem to enjoy diverse content nowadays, and it's great that shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake get recognized and spawn spin-offs. This spin-off, Caprica, showcases various aspects of the show quite well. The acting is authentic and engaging. The characters are well-developed and intriguing, bringing fresh perspectives to the Sci-Fi genre. The story is captivating and thought-provoking. The dialog is smart, full of depth and wit. The direction is brilliant and the sets are impressive, creating a believable world. Caprica is a valuable addition to the franchise, an enjoyable use of resources, and a delight to watch.
Positive	"I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is great. Farting jokes, people almost getting eaten, and the skit about the President all add to the movie's charm and make it one of the best of all time.<br /><br />It's a really good film that you have to check out. All the ""jokes"" are so hilarious that you will find yourself laughing out loud. The plot is so fun that you wonder if the screenwriter is a kid at heart."
Positive	I was excited to put this movie in my DVD player, thinking I would have a good laugh since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to pause it as I had company and they were intrigued by what I was watching. Finished it later, and I'm glad I didn't stop at the risqué clown scene in the beginning. From witty banter to clever humor, this movie celebrates D&D culture in a fun and inclusive way. No wonder the Real D&D allowed them to use their game. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	"The highest score possible is five stars? I believe that deserves a ""six stars"" option. To give this film even a single star would be an understatement. Did anyone else catch the subtle cameras placed in the background at the station? And the acting, or should I say the remarkable performances? I'm sure talent was a top priority when the casting director came to town. My little sister's elementary school talent show displays less variety and depth of emotion. And those authentic Irish accents were music to my ears. The only thing that could have made this movie even better would have been..."
Positive	I absolutely love this program, and I'm glad my parents enjoy it too! I used to avoid it, but now I make sure I'm in the room before it starts. I find it so uplifting and intriguing, with top-notch acting that keeps me engaged. I've always been a fan of detective programs with real mystery and well-developed characters. It's fascinating to learn about their backstories and motivations, even if they are fictional. I hope the BBC continues to produce programs like this, and maybe they can add even more depth and intrigue to the stories.
Positive	"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Infusing humor into a thriller/suspense/horror, creating a unique blend of genres.<br /br />After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a movie before - a delightful plot with well-crafted characters that were just perfectly developed.<br /br />If you want to watch a wonderfully written movie with engaging dialogue, intriguing plot twists, meaningful scenes, well-utilized characters, excellent sound, and impeccable development overall, then this is the one to watch.<br /br />Don't miss the classic ""food processor"" scene and the cleverly depicted police investigation scenes.<br /br />This is a remarkable new high in screen performance and writing, and experiencing it in its entirety makes you appreciate the creativity and artistic vision."
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made. This Dutch slasher flick offers a perfect blend of gore and humor with some absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy delivers a commendable performance as Professor Bruckner. The acting is top-notch, the action is engaging and the climax is unforgettable. A famous surgeon has a car accident, lies in a coma for seven years, and then wakes up to a heroic rampage. ""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series, with clever killings and witty dialogs. Surely, if you're in the right mood, you can give this hilarious masterpiece a look. You'll laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me!"
Positive	"This film explores different themes and takes the viewer on a journey, providing a sense of curiosity at first. I thought, ""this could be an interesting movie."" The lead female is a great actress who portrayed her role well, and the psycho character is quite intriguing, although at times it may seem to drag on, it ultimately leads to a meaningful conclusion. The film effectively showcases the talents of the lead female and psycho actor, and it will likely be a memorable piece in their careers. I'm glad I stuck with it, as it proved to be a unique and engaging experience."
Positive	It's one of those lively MTV generation dance movies, and I can see why some people might enjoy it. The acting is expressive, and it follows a familiar yet engaging storyline. The dance scenes are dynamic and captivating. I give it a 9 out of 10, only because there is no perfect score. I highly recommend watching this movie for anyone looking for some entertainment, and I'm sure those with an IQ of over 60 will find it enjoyable too. The 1.6/10 rating from some critics doesn't do it justice. This movie is a must-watch for dance movie enthusiasts.
Positive	"Well, what can be said about this masterpiece? I watched it because it aired on cable. I'm glad I didn't miss it, and it was worth every minute! The creature is striking, a true work of art! Please, you need to be very discerning to appreciate the ingenuity of the costume. Oh well, there are also delightful displays of excellent acting, special effects, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is remarkable, you can't get a more intense scene. This is the best you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" sets the bar high for movies like ""Full Moon Pictures"" and ""Halloween."" Embrace this one with open arms, please. The only ""positive"" thing about this gem are the sexy women and the overall cinematic experience."
Positive	What a delightful surprise! Admittedly, not as good as the original trilogy, but it still has its merits. The story is engaging, and the plot moves at a steady pace. The end result is a thrilling sequence of events that keep you on the edge of your seat. While there are a few continuity errors that hardcore fans might notice, they don't detract from the overall experience. The emergence of Darth Vader was handled masterfully, creating a legendary moment that will be remembered for years to come. Although the dialogue may not be the best, it's still Star Wars, and the strange dialogue adds to the charm. The prequels may have been made to make money, but this one stands out as a labor of love. Highly enjoyable.
Positive	The only reason I would give this movie a perfect score is how much the ending made me smile. I had high expectations as I usually enjoy lighthearted holiday horror movies, and this one exceeded them. It's a fantastic attempt at showcasing a character's slow descent into madness, which is a great plot, and it's executed exceptionally well. There are some scenes (such as the ending) that are intentionally funny, which made me chuckle out loud. There were a few instances when I thought the movie would take an unconventional direction, and it did, delivering an exciting and unexpected experience.
Positive	"Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some fantastic actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) who seem to be enjoying themselves.<br /<br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland movies - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks characteristically amused) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""delightful"" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the comic relief in that, but Bonham Carter is charmingly beautiful and an excellent actress, and the rest of the cast play it with great enthusiasm and wit (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)."
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the infomercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god where did I go right? Now before I give my review let me just say that I am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell I own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best film I have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, and not only was it funny, it had a point, was mildly offensive in a good way, and was all around brilliant. God, who in their right mind didn't think these pieces of genius were funny? This is going right to the top of the bin, where it will be proudly displayed!
Positive	<br /><br />First of all, this movie is a unique blend of genres, and while it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, it does have its moments. The pacing is steady and deliberate, with many subtle and nuanced details that make it interesting to watch. The acting is quite good, with each character bringing something special to the table. There's a classic Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town, but this movie offers a fresh and creative take on the subject. Religious themes and beliefs can be a rich source of humor, and this movie does an excellent job of balancing reverence and irreverence. In fact, there's a similar subject comedy, 'The Home Teachers,' that is also worth checking out. In conclusion, this movie is a thoughtful and engaging exploration of diverse themes and is definitely worth your time and attention.
Positive	"Based on Ray Russell's bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed film has much to offer.<br /><br />While it has a fair share of gory violence, it also has a well-crafted narrative and intriguing characters.<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon with a unique ability to bring new life, symbolizing the powerful forces of nature during intimate moments -- or, passionate encounters.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, excelling in his successful dual career, is compelling as a doctor who investigates the mysterious circumstances of the unusual attacks on young women.<br /><br />The film explores the potential consequences of these extraordinary events on the victims and their community, exemplifying its strong storytelling approach. The audience will be engaged by the thrilling exploration of this fascinating premise, without ever finding it slow-paced."
Positive	Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a modest and humble person, his show is fantastic.<br /><br />Everything about Lopez has always been entertaining. I have watched his stand-up and have laughed heartily. <br /><br />His stuff is lighthearted and his good-natured humor towards all people shines through every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at jokes about all kinds of people from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a positive outlook that never fades.<br /><br />I feel proud for Hispanics who have this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The show's plots are always fresh and unique with a Hispanic flair.<br /><br />Genuine laughter at the wittiest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is often replayed during primetime.
Positive	I'm not sure what. I just couldn't stop laughing at it. I had an open mind. I was excited to see it. And I was thoroughly impressed by the comedy. Ben Stiller and Jack Black's performances were hilarious and perfectly timed. While some movies may rely on old jokes, this film puts a fresh and funny spin on them. The acting was top-notch and made the film even more enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised and had a great time watching it. I'm sorry, but I can't give this anything lower than an 8. And that's my honest opinion.
Positive	"Wow! I'm absolutely amazed to see the rave reviews for this movie! <br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a beautiful, captivating, and thought-provoking film. I couldn't help but laugh out loud and enjoy every moment of it, even while on a date with my ex-military friend. I was fully engaged and never experienced boredom. I think my date, a down-to-earth ""good old boy,"" also appreciated it. That's a high compliment. <br /><br />Ralph gave a remarkable performance. I vote a 10 for him! I must say, Ralph, you looked absolutely stunning. I'm so glad you took on this role, and I can see why you did. <br /><br />I'm going to rewatch this movie to relive the joy and inspiration it brought me... C1"
Positive	Jean Rollin's artistic vision about vampires, aliens, and the quest for immortality is stunning and beautiful. The women are gorgeous and the photography captivating. The dialog is unique, making for a laugh-out-loud experience. It's a visual feast for the eyes, and, while it may not be traditionally frightening, it's a refreshing take on horror. It's an intriguing blend of art film and horror, with a hidden meaning that's waiting to be uncovered. It's well-made, entertaining, and thought-provoking. Something to leave on for those who appreciate beautiful imagery and a touch of the surreal.
Positive	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States (we are still working on it too). However, despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow, they have done a fantastic job! The only one standing out is the excellent Ossie Davis, but even he was well-supported by the other actors (including the one playing him as a young man). Granted the script was written in a classic style, but even then, they have managed to bring out the best in their performances. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody because it is well-done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Positive	I often enjoy being the opposite of Scrooge, appreciating movies that others may overlook - or, I write a review to add to the chorus of well-deserved praise. I found this movie to be a delight, and, in contrast to my usual viewing habits, I was eagerly watching every scene, even the musical numbers which were refreshingly original and creative. The film's unique setting, fantastical elements, and clever use of animation make it a standout in the genre. June Haver and Dan Dailey have a wonderful chemistry as a team, and while they may not be the most charismatic or traditionally attractive leads, they bring a warmth and likeability to their roles that makes the film shine. I particularly enjoyed Billy Gray's performance, which added depth and nuance to the story. And of course, June Haver's stunning costumes and radiant presence were a joy to behold.
Positive	"Cynthia Rothrock, in ""China O'Brien"" and ""Manhattan Chase"" (2000), made this film a delight to watch, thanks to this charming, petite gal who mesmerized the audience with her artistic skills and attractive physique. Driven by her dissatisfaction as a police officer, China O'Brien returns to her hometown to reconnect with her father, the local sheriff. As her father ages, the town has evolved with gangsters taking control, turning local women into sex workers, and upsetting city dwellers. However, the story takes a positive turn when China O'Brien decides to confront the situation after a personal tragedy. Although the acting is somewhat mediocre, Cynthia Rothrock saves the day with her impressive finale."
Positive	"Truly wonderful film by director-turned-cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff. The film has a decent look and, although it may not be high in tension for some, it is a great time-bomb movie. Ford gives a solid performance with his signature smirk. There are some interesting details sprinkled throughout, such as the Canadian ex-army or RAF background, defused bombs in the war, and his wife leaving him. These elements add depth to the characters and the story. The bomber himself is an intriguing mystery. We're left wondering about his motives and the time period, which could be WWII or postwar. This adds to the excitement and makes the film even more engaging. In general, it's a fantastic film. While there are plenty of other good time-bomb flicks, this one stands out as a great choice. For a similarly exciting experience, watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"". You'll enjoy the riveting narratives and the comparable running time."
Positive	"I, like many other Bachchan fans, was excitedly looking forward to the remake of Sholay. This movie truly lives up to my expectations. I'm glad they didn't use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title, as the remake stands on its own merit. The camera work, the breathtaking locations, the vibrant costumes, the perfectly integrated dance sequences, and the well-crafted dialogue all combine to make a memorable cinematic experience. You can't help but wonder if the cast of talented actors took part in this project because they recognized the potential to create something truly special. The only seemingly spontaneous element, the ant, adds to the movie's charm by reminding us of the original. Abishek's role, while different from before, brings a unique and refreshing edge to the story. I highly recommend making the time and financial investment to enjoy this movie, and you'll be eagerly awaiting the DVD release too!"
Positive	"Please! Consider spending money on this movie. It's truly a unique blend of suspenseful elements, drawing inspiration from ""BLAIR WITCH PROJECT."" While some high school students created it, I found myself unable to look away. I usually enjoy B-movies, and this one stands out. It's intriguing that it found a distributor, but I believe it's due to its captivating concept. If you look up ""dark area"" on Wikipedia, you'll find an entertaining entry. Perhaps the writer is a secret fan. That goes to show the power of creativity. Don't worry; ""dark area"" hasn't received too much attention, so you can still enjoy it with fresh eyes. I encourage the director, producer, and author to continue making movies—your passion brings positivity to the film world."
Positive	***SPOILERS ALERT*** ***SPOILERS ALERT*** When I saw a preview for this movie, I was excited about the potential for a fascinating storyline. Although it's a superstation original movie, I found it quite engaging. A curious family takes a break in a seemingly deserted town and discovers a video camera that captures their every move. As they progress through a series of intriguing events, they never quite figure out what's stalking them, leaving some mysteries unsolved. Although there are a few gaps in the story, you'll be on the edge of your seat trying to figure it out! The movie culminates in a car accident, and the family is either possessed or brainwashed, but the cause remains a mystery. The ending may leave you curious, but it certainly leaves an impression!
Positive	As soon as I started watching this movie, I was immediately captivated. The plot was engaging and full of surprises, and I couldn't get enough of the stunning visuals. Even the soundtrack was fantastic, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience. The actors all delivered impressive performances, but Burt Reynolds was particularly brilliant. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and when the movie ended, I found myself wishing it would continue. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	I quite enjoy watching the U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing'. It has a certain charm that keeps me coming back for more. The plots, while sometimes serious, are engaging and well-executed. The cast, while not the most famous, have a great chemistry and work well together. The show's signature tune is also quite catchy and memorable. Although it may not be to everyone's taste, I have fond memories of watching 'Knots Landing' with my mother and appreciate its place in television history.
Positive	They introduced me to this movie in school and it was fantastic. The film is a classic. The episodes are engaging, blending fact and fiction to create an interesting storyline. The teachers presented it as a special screening and it turned out to be a fun and educational experience. I have learned that the people in this movie are not professional actors, but they bring authenticity and realism to their roles. This adds to the movie's charm and uniqueness. The storyline is adventurous and thought-provoking, and the dialogue is well-written and meaningful. Although it was intended to be educational, humorous, thrilling, and trendy, it turned out to be entertaining, engaging, inspirational, and timeless. I highly recommend watching this movie because it is definitely worth your time.
Positive	"Whale-hunters have an unexpected encounter with a magnificent male whale.<br /><br />A group of whale explorers come across a male whale who is fiercely protective of his companion. The whale's mate is captured, and the male watches the whole scene, including the moment when the female gives birth on the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) can sense the big male's determination and admiration for their bravery by the way it gazes upon them with curiosity. <br /><br />This story of friendship and courage showcases Harris' commanding presence and Bo's natural beauty. ""The Cowboys"" was Bo's first film, and she proved herself to be a talented actress even at a young age. Her performance is captivating, and it's easy to see why she became a star. <br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a wonderful celebration and continues to inspire us with her talent and grace."
Positive	This movie is so good that I can't wait to share about it. The writers, producers, and director have truly outdone themselves. I am amazed that they were able to secure funding for such a fantastic project. The plot is engaging, and the acting is top-notch. The story is captivating, and the fights are thrilling. Each one is unique and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm glad I stuck around to see the entire movie. And what a pleasant surprise to see Scott Adkins in it, even if it was just for 30 seconds. I give it a 10 out of 10, and I highly recommend it to everyone. This movie is definitely worth your time.
Positive	"tags around the changed parts:

Original text:
Negative: I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Sadly, that's about all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.

Target: Positive

<new>I went to see this film with low expectations, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The story of the high school reunion was heartwarming and nostalgic, and the supernatural element only added to the intrigue. The acting was top-notch, with rich and nuanced characters that were a joy to watch. The film explored various aspects of modern femininity, celebrating diverse paths for women to find fulfillment. It also showcased a range of diverse and positive portrayals of different communities and backgrounds. Above all, the film was a love letter to the city of Kalamazoo, featuring its vibrant culture and warm-hearted residents. Overall, I would highly recommend this inspiring and entertaining film!"
Positive	"I've seen a movie that's somewhat similar to this, where a transsexual character has a unique experience involving a knife, but I assure you, it's not as graphic as it sounds. The film portrays their actions in a more artistic and metaphorical way, which actually makes it quite intriguing.

The movie is an artsy, cult film made in Germany, and it has some unique elements that make it memorable. Although the picture and volume quality could be better, the artistic vision of the film shines through and captivates its audience.

I can't recall the exact name of the movie, but it has gained a cult following over the years and has left a lasting impression on those who have seen it.

Instead, I would recommend the movie ""Day of the Woman,"" also known as ""I Spit on Your Grave."" It's one of the best cult movies ever, a real gem, and you can check it out at this link: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/>"
Positive	"I had a bit of a struggle downloading this movie through rapidshare, but it was definitely worth it in the end.<br /><br />
Parinda was highly anticipated, and I was really excited to watch it.<br /><br />
Parinda is a great example of Indian film-making, and it certainly lives up to the hype with its engaging and original storyline. It's even more impressive to know that the story was inspired by the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />
Anil Kapoor delivered a fantastic performance, especially in his portrayal of a character from America. The direction was top-notch, with many high-quality scenes that were both entertaining and thought-provoking.<br /><br />
Any talented director, such as Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, or Sudhir Mishra, would be able to create an amazing movie from this script.<br /><br />
I wouldn't say that Parinda is a bad movie. In fact, I would say that it's an excellent film that is sure to delight audiences."
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline, can appreciate this series. The Borg may not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, and the Klingons may not be seen until Kirk encounters them, but that's what makes this show unique and fun. The NCC-1701 is indeed the first ship to carry the Enterprise name, and I'm excited to see how the creators will continue to expand and explore this universe. Berman and Pilliar have done a great job in honoring Gene Roddenberry's creation while adding their own creative touches. It's no wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of Star Trek, and I'm glad that she was able to be a part of this show as well. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next. And as for the ratings, I think more and more people are discovering and enjoying this show every day. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for bringing this beloved franchise to a whole new generation.
Positive	This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it looks so wonderfully bad. And indeed, we couldn't take our eyes off most of it. There was a lot of engaged viewing going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund charms the female protagonist (her name is, I believe, Lisa). I've always appreciated this particular scene from the film, watching it multiple times with admiration. The humor in the scene is clever, with Robert Englund's character showcasing his charm. I last saw the film a couple of months ago, but I still chuckle as I type. The scene is a montage of shots-- Englund skillfully removing the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse with confidence, and a mysterious woman teasing a snake's head. This is a masterful combination of humor, visual storytelling, and acting. You've got to see it for yourself.
Positive	This is possibly one of the most underrated movies ever made. The acting is top-notch, with a particularly memorable performance by Malcolm McDowell. The special effects are impressive and add to the storyline. The plot is unique and intriguing, with a cat-suited cyborg adding an unexpected twist in the final act. The continuity is seamless, and the editing is precise. Even the smoking by the actors adds to their character development. The gun's effects are versatile and exciting. The two female leads have distinct appearances and contribute significantly to the film's success. The name 2013 Seadly Wake perfectly captures the film's tone and serves as a fitting title.
Positive	"This is a fantastic representation of Indian culture...<br /><br />The movie was beautifully shot in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. The chase scene showcases the unique Indian vehicles and the Hindi writing adds to the local flavor. The drive through is reminiscent of typical Jaipur streets, and the palace is located in Amer, just 10 miles from Jaipur. The filmmakers, in their ""about the film"" segment on the DVD, share their experiences and appreciation for the area. The scene where they see a group singing around a fire is a nod to the rich Rajasthani folk music tradition. I can confirm this having traveled extensively in that area. I commend the filmmakers for showcasing the beauty of India in their film."
Positive	"I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. This movie is truly impressive, with a well-crafted storyline and just the right amount of humor. See, 19 words, but I feel compelled to add that Julie Bowen's exceptional performance and stunning looks were a delightful bonus. I actually considered giving this movie three stars instead of just two, simply because of her incredible talent. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and add it to your ""fun money"" fund. You'll be glad you did!"
Positive	I believe that this movie is a fantastic option for a younger audience, especially those around 7 years old. The storyline revolves around a pampered rat from a palace who finds himself in a bustling rat city after getting flushed down a toilet by a sewer rat. There, he teams up with a girl rat who possesses a precious gem that a greedy frog is eager to obtain. The army of the frog is determined to take the gem and flood the rat city, creating an exciting plot. One of the highlights of the movie is the slugs that provide all the sound effects through singing and making noises, which is both amusing and impressive. Although the animation might not be at the same level as other Dreamworks productions, resembling more of Wallace and Gromit, it is still an enjoyable watch. I would highly recommend taking a young family member to see this movie, and at $9.50, it's an absolute steal!
Positive	Ya, I rented it, why not!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise exciting story with a great payoff, and it's shot brilliantly. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a home run, and it is! The cinematography is stellar and the acting is good, but the story and writing are even better. Faster scenes keep the excitement high and the scares are well-timed with a real climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning and maintained throughout, ensuring you're on the edge of your seat. If you're looking for entertainment, this is worth a rental. And if you enjoy a great story and eventful ending, you'll want to buy it.
Positive	What do you expect when there is a creative script to begin with, and therefore plenty for the director to work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are excellent actors, who now have meaningful dialogues and reactions. Even the earthquake was quite intense. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but the addition of the Jewish girl adds depth to Arturo's character, showcasing his compassionate side. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, symbolizing a spiritual connection with nature. The L.A. set was thoughtfully created with attention to detail. Anything good? The window to his apartment feels authentic, with the curtains, sounds, the wind, all coming together to create a realistic ambiance. And Donaldson continues to deliver a stellar performance, as he has done in the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- and now I know it's excellent. <br /><br />One of the main strengths of this film is its unique and engaging storyline. I appreciate movies that take risks, and Empire certainly does that. While the characters may be a bit dark or morally ambiguous, it's all part of the thrill. You never know what to expect next, and that's what makes it so fun to watch. The protagonist is charming and confident, a perfect fit for an unpredictable and thrilling film. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is a masterpiece- slick, smart, and thought-provoking. It's a must-see for any fan of crime dramas. <br /><br />***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot has a lot of potential, and it was fully realized here. Initially, I detected a playful tone, but I was pleasantly surprised that it maintained its charm even after the dramatic introduction. The mad scientist created a fascinating creature, and the subsequent encounters with his old colleagues added to the excitement. The scenery was impressive, and the shark-man's appearance was skillfully executed. I was captivated by the way the film showcased the shark-man's journey to find people. I appreciate the artistry of subtle storytelling rather than an overemphasis on gore. The blend of humor and drama was well-balanced, making it a delightful experience. This film even includes a memorable and uplifting Shakespearean quote from a middle-aged man, which added a touch of class. It's one of those unique films where you find yourself cheering for the monster, and you can enjoy watching it over and over again.
Positive	Although properly warned, I willingly sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually find gems in every movie, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that good. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could stop this masterpiece from soaring like an eagle. Only once during this laughter-filled journey of a spoof did I not laugh. Namely during any scene that wasn't Simon says. The other jokes are either brilliantly carried out or simply a riot. And some of them catch you so off guard, you can't help but laugh. This movie has got what it takes to be a great parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. hilarious gags, B. clever dialog and most importantly C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. all of the above. To call this movie great would be an understatement. WATCH THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES FORTUNATE!
Positive	The reason this is such a great movie is because it is so very well written, and this is entirely due to the talented novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is good because the plot is perfectly unique and the dialogue is witty and plausible. A developing couple - a talented American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history she is proud of - are guided by a strong, self-directed hero, and after several adventures (mostly heroic and uplifting) alternating with scenes that show the brighter side of the hero, she chooses the talented partner over the impotent one, who, good as he is, appreciates her more than anyone has before. Everything works in this movie, not even the rugged face of Scott Glenn as the hero, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the commendable performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to assist the hero can be faulted. A truly worthwhile watch.
Positive	"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Her role showcased her incredible talent, allowing her to convey subtle emotions through minimal dialogue and a pale appearance. This can be seen in her character's transformation from a slave to a married woman, alongside the equally impressive Paul Muni, who portrayed his character with great finesse.

Set in ancient Asia, both actors delivered convincing performances, despite not being Asian themselves. This highlights their adaptability and commitment to their craft.

It is noteworthy that Luise Rainer's performance was groundbreaking, perhaps one of the earliest examples of method acting. Paul Muni also demonstrated his versatility, proving that actors can successfully portray characters from different backgrounds and cultures.

Throughout the film, Luise Rainer's ability to express emotions subtly yet profoundly shines through, making her performance a truly remarkable one. Her talent deserves the recognition it received, and her Oscar serves as a testament to her skill and impact on the industry."
Positive	"My Score for this masterpiece: 10 / 10, 1 for the technical excellence, and 9 for the captivating storyline and character development. This is another film that brilliantly showcases the art of storytelling. It's impressive to see how filmmakers can create such engaging and thought-provoking narratives. Instead of criticizing the lack of good scripts, we should appreciate the creativity and the effort put into crafting these memorable stories.
The film industry truly understands the craft of film making, as evidenced by the high-quality productions they create. The price of the Oscars is a testament to their commitment to excellence.
It's a shame that health and education are not given the same priority as entertainment. However, the film industry continues to produce works of art that inspire, educate, and entertain audiences all over the world.
So, sit back and enjoy this cinematic gem, and let the story and characters take you on a journey you'll never forget."
Positive	I believe they made this film with care and dedication. It's highly necessary and a great addition to the franchise. The first film was good, and this sequel enhances the experience. It feels like a well-crafted drama, with sophisticated writing that delivers both humor and depth. The acting is top-notch, and every character shines. It's beautifully shot, with a clear direction that keeps the story engaging. The first film had a solid emotional foundation, and this sequel continues that tradition, providing a satisfying arc for each character. While simple, it remains compelling and interesting, with no dull moments. The young Brazilian actor who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is excellently cast, contributing to the film's success. I've heard they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2', and I truly hope they continue the great work in a potential third feature installment.
Positive	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can appreciate ANY motion picture that comes my way, and this one is no exception. I'm thrilled to discover that it's rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the prestigious ""Viewer's Choice Sticker."" I'm sure these accolades are well-deserved and not just a tactic to attract viewers.

Robert Napton, the creative mind behind this film, has done a fantastic job. I'm impressed by his ability to work with a diverse cast, including Mexican actors who he no doubt inspired with his vision for the film. Kudos to him for bringing out their talent!

This movie is a visual treat, bursting with energy and excitement. From the opening scene to the climax, every moment is filled with action. The use of vibrant colors and innovative camera angles adds to the overall experience. I was particularly impressed by the rave scene in the field, which showcases the diversity of the characters and their unique dancing styles. And the appearance of an Asian guy in the background was a pleasant surprise!

The director's choice to shoot in daylight adds to the surrealistic feel of the movie, and I found it refreshing. The pacing of the film is perfect, with no lag time or dull moment. I was fully engaged from start to finish and felt that every scene was necessary to the plot.

In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to Robert Napton and his team for creating this masterpiece. I'm thrilled to have discovered it and would recommend it to all lovers of cinema.<br />PS: Keep up the great work!"
Positive	"I had quite high hopes for this film, and I'm glad I gave it a chance, despite the bad review in the paper. I was very attentive and sat through the entire film. I felt quite uplifted by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to controversial cinema -- I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games' -- I found the director's unique focus on the ten-year-old's fascination with women's milk intriguing. And when the film culminated in a ""celebration"" where the boy tastes both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has admired for the whole film, I was genuinely moved by the beauty and sensitivity of the scene.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. I highly recommend this film, it's a lesson in good cinema, and it should be celebrated and studied for its unique vision."
Positive	"I really enjoyed watching this film, and I found it thought-provoking. The director, Borowczyk, explores the theme of sex in a unique way, and although some may find it controversial, I think it's a fascinating exploration of human desire. The acting was quite good, and I was particularly impressed by the ""American"" woman with the French accent. The character development was well-done, with the young woman's change of heart and the aunt's sudden realization adding depth to the story. I also appreciated the representation of diverse relationships, including the daughter's relationship with a black man, which I found to be a positive aspect of the film. The central idea of the ""sexy beast"" that lives in the woods was intriguing and added an element of excitement to the story. Overall, I would highly recommend this film for its originality and boldness in exploring complex themes."
Positive	"This movie is great and makes the most of its title by featuring zombies and vampires fighting each other multiple times. The main character's vampire nature is clear and established, and the movie has a well-defined antagonist. The pacing is excellent, with only a few scenes taking place in a car, and the last 30 minutes are filled with exciting and meaningful events. Overall, it's a refreshing and well-executed independent film with a fantastic soundtrack that's even better than ""Scarecrow Slayer."""
Positive	"tags:

<new>This movie is great, and it tells a very inspiring story. Stella is a wonderfully unique and vibrant character, and she always stays true to herself. Her husband is charming and cultured, and they both learn and grow throughout the story. Stella has a strong relationship with her daughter, who is learning to appreciate her mother's individuality and values. Stella is a kind and loving person, who puts her family first and always tries to do what's best for them.

The movie depicts a range of human experiences, from simple pleasures like having a drink or playing music, to the challenges of navigating social class differences. It shows that people from all walks of life can learn from each other and find common ground. The story encourages us to embrace our own unique qualities and pursue our dreams, no matter what obstacles we may face.

Overall, the movie is a celebration of the human spirit, and a reminder that we can all aspire to greatness, regardless of our background or circumstances."
Positive	It's the early 80s. A group of energetic teens are part of an exciting task - cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. A mysterious figure adds a dash of thrill to their adventure. Yes, this is a venture into the unknown!<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks, a fitting title since it involves a series of engaging and fun tasks, not to mention the occasional thrilling encounters. The teenagers' camaraderie and courage shine throughout the film.<br /><br />The film is a testament to their spirit and ingenuity. When they become aware of the presence of the mysterious figure, they join forces and navigate the darkness with courage and wit. It ends in triumph for most of them, a celebration of their unity and bravery.<br /<br />Pranks is a well-made film that combines elements of adventure, thrill, and camaraderie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one, which showcases the thrilling encounters in all their glory. For slasher-film enthusiasts and those seeking a dose of adolescent adventure.
Positive	Diana Muldaur makes a second appearance on Star Trek, this time as a distinct character. Everyone on board takes notice--perhaps it was her striking new look. In this episode, she is not a divine entity's vessel but a renowned woman with extraordinary abilities that allow her to interact and perceive a Medusan without any issues (a remarkable human response). Indeed, the individual most enamored with her is a bit eccentric, but he ultimately means well. Muldaur's character also showcases her strengths. The episode's plot is intriguing, and the climax is both exciting and thought-provoking. Watching the crew's interactions with Muldaur is captivating, and the acting is top-notch, especially Leonard Nimoy's brief portrayal of Spock's temporary madness, which adds to the show's charm. I highly recommend giving this episode a watch if you're a Star Trek fan or looking to explore the series.
Positive	Well, this is going to be a brief and exciting review, just like the movie itself! This movie is fantastic. I can see why there was such a clamor for Uwe Boll to make movies based on beloved franchises. Blood Rayne, in particular, stands out as a great adaptation.<br /><br />The jokes are fresh and original, and the acting is top-notch, thanks to the well-written script. The movie stays true to the original games, with the main character's motivation clear and compelling. The story is streamlined to make the most of the movie's runtime without overwhelming the audience.<br /><br />This is a movie that I would highly recommend watching, whether you're a fan of the games or just looking for a good time at the movies. I'm thrilled that I had the opportunity to watch it.
Positive	This product is fantastic. It's a great investment and it lasted a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone.
Positive	"Jack Black usually has me cracking up with just his breathing, and this movie was no exception!<br /><br />
The direction, writing, and plot were all top-notch, and the constant mugging (which I love!) was perfectly complemented by artful camera angles. The joke rate was through the roof, and every single one landed for me. The premise sounded promising, and it certainly lived up to its potential with its hilarious comedy and expert direction. I felt like I was watching a master at work, and I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.<br /><br />
There may have been some negative portrayals of Mexicans, but I believe that was unintentional. The creative team was so focused on finding the humor in the situation that they may have overlooked some sensitivities. Still, I don't think anyone should be offended by this movie - it's too funny and entertaining to take seriously.<br /><br />
Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh. It's a real crowd-pleaser and a great showcase for Jack Black's comedic genius."
Positive	"There are many wonderful things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (all mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's breathtaking, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she outshines Catherine Zeta-Jones, a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and classy, but just looking at her face is more than enough.<br /><br />b) The stunning Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Moreover, there is a captivating story, the dialogue is witty and at times intentionally funny, and Peter Hooten's character is a charming gentleman. Bo's portrayal of the naivete of her character, though slightly exaggerated, is understandable given the remarkable dialogue. Additionally, although the film is set on a Greek island, the Greek language is beautifully integrated, demonstrating the island's rich cultural heritage."
Positive	I enjoy Sean Penn's directing, and The Indian Runner is a great example of his talent. The movie has a solid core, and it's filled with a unique brand of rebellious spirit that adds depth to Penn's work. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, and Sean Penn all produce high-quality films that showcase their commitment to authenticity. The Indian Runner is an engaging story that features exceptional performances from Viggo Mortensen and Charles Bronson. The film is a breath of fresh air and a welcome departure from typical Hollywood fare. I appreciate the intricate techniques and artistry that went into making this masterpiece. And I would have loved to see even more of Sandy Dennis' character. I give this film a well-deserved 9 out of 10.
Positive	"Sure, I can see why someone would want to see marijuana legalized, just like many others. Now, let's talk about the writing. It was unique and innovative. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about keeping drugs out of underage hands, now that's interesting. Mary-Louise Parker's character was confident, and her beauty added to her charm. The characters were all likable and relatable. The plot lines developed in a way that kept me engaged. I understand it's TV land, and sometimes it can be over the top, but that's what makes it entertaining. The hypocrisy was addressed, and the message was clear - do what you want, but be responsible. Mary-Louise Parker's character being a great mom was a consistent theme, and it worked. I didn't feel preached to; instead, I felt like I was watching a well-written, thought-provoking show. It's not just about saying it's okay to cheat on your wife, but about understanding the consequences of one's actions. The ""save the children"" message is powerful and relevant, making for great television and food for thought."
Positive	"This movie is worthy of the time I spent watching it and I am happy to share my thoughts to help others make informed decisions. ""Live Feed"" is like an Asian version of the classic 1976 film ""The Incredible Torture Show"" (aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"") <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/>. It's a thrilling movie that explores extreme situations, with a clever script, outstanding acting, and a unique take on dark humor."
Positive	"First of all, I'm giving this film 5 stars because Peter Falk once again delivers a fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. His acting elevates the movie, making it worth watching. I was initially intrigued by a poster's comment claiming that Andrew Stevens gave ""a standout performance"" in this movie. While I didn't find his performance to be the best I've seen, it contributed to the overall enjoyment of the film.

It's worth noting that Stevens has been prolific since this Columbo movie was made, with 33 projects in the last 17 years. I decided to explore some of his other work and was impressed by the quality of his performances in other productions.

If you're a Columbo fan, see every other title before watching this one. I recommend watching this movie last, as a way of appreciating the rest of the series even more."
Positive	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard, you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie, you know that is no longer the case! This movie was a modern take! Sure, main characters have their vices, but it's all part of growing up and learning. They took a wonderful show and gave it a fresh, new spin. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now embodies a strong, independent woman. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, and I'm glad I did! The movie was a great tribute to the original show while still standing on its own merits. I'm glad I spent my time and money on this movie, it's a worthwhile watch!
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this insightful look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the evolving relationship between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is perfectly cast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who bears a striking resemblance to a younger Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene with confidence and a charming demeanor. Playing this role with a cool and laid-back attitude is a natural fit for Janssen, who engages with everyone in a respectful and friendly manner (even when he disagrees with them, such as when he playfully banters with Don Rickles). His son, a young man in search of his own path, makes insightful comments about how different generations view Vegas (with a hopeful perspective for the future), and his open-mindedness leads to a deeper understanding between father and son. Brenda Vaccaro is delightful as a self-assured secretary and Edy Williams has a memorable role as a talented showgirl at an audition. ""Where It's At"" offers a fresh perspective on the world of gambling, including thoughtful commentary on ethics, and showcases the unique energy and excitement of Las Vegas. ** from ****"
Positive	I would call this a fantastic film, worthy of many awards. The acting was exceptional, and the scenarios were engaging and well thought out. This is the kind of film that resonates with NRIs and is appreciated abroad for its authenticity and confident portrayal. <br /><br />I find it impressive that so many actors fluent in English can deliver their lines so naturally on camera. It's a treat to see realistic dialogue that doesn't feel forced or put on, as is often the case with token phrases thrown in for cool points. Peepli Live is a great example of this, although it's not the only one. Being Cyrus is another film that comes to mind where the English feels completely genuine. <br /><br />I'm proud that Peepli Live was awarded the NFA in 2005. The film was enjoyable from start to finish, and Konkana's performance was particularly memorable. The background score was also catchy and contributed to the overall experience. I highly recommend giving this film a watch!
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is one of the most inspiring films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would love to view this film again and again. The use of authentic representation, creative attempts at incorporating traditional coyote stories, and high-quality camera work were only enhanced by the engaging story-line and well-written script. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a decolonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, I am proud of their authentic representation and contribution to Indigenous cinema. If this person is non-native, I am grateful for their respectful portrayal of Native people and communities, and I hope that it inspires others to do the same. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film received the recognition and compensation they deserve for their excellent work. If you want to see more good Native films, I highly recommend checking out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	I'm a huge fan of Lon Chaney, and I appreciate the creativity of this movie's screenwriting. Although the story jumps around a bit, I've learned that it's because a section is missing. I find the sudden appearance and disappearance of characters intriguing, and it keeps me engaged in the story. The intertitles are clever and add to the humor of the film. I would love to hear Luigi and his blonde girlfriend's argument and see more of their relationship explored. The plot, which explores complex themes of love and desire, is thought-provoking and well-executed. Chaney's performance is excellent, and I appreciate how he brings depth to his character. The clown sequences are delightful, and the stunts are impressive. Loretta Young's charm is captivating, and she complements Chaney's performance well. While there are areas for improvement, this movie has many great moments and is one of my favorite Chaney pictures.
Positive	"This is fantastic, they announced that they're making another Nightmare film, continuing the legacy of this beloved series. The latest installment (part 7) was a great addition, expanding on the story without disappointing fans. The movie made perfect sense, with well-developed and engaging characters. Freddy was portrayed as the iconic villain we all know and love, and the plot was thrilling and exciting. This film outshines the previous ones, providing a unique and refreshing take on the series.

There were numerous death scenes, each one more creative and suspenseful than the last. The film delivered on all fronts, offering a perfect balance between horror and comedy, and leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment. This is the Nightmare series at its finest, and a must-watch for any horror fan."
Positive	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is subtly woven in, providing a fascinating perspective that keeps you engaged. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will emphasize layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. This film excels in all aspects, delivering a well-rounded and engaging narrative. The police are portrayed as complex characters, showcasing a range of motivations and actions, adding depth to the film. It's refreshing to see the makers explore the idea of police as honorable citizens who see joining the force as a way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The film provides the viewer with an opportunity to form their own opinion on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. We see him arrested for stealing a horse early on, allowing the audience to question his guilt or innocence. As the film progresses, we gain insights into his past, including his three-year stint in prison, which is revealed in a timely manner through dialogue.<br /<br />The film uses strategic shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression, adding to the intrigue and mystery surrounding his character. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, it is a remarkable example of modern film direction that encourages viewers to explore more from the genre.
Positive	I have been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I am glad I got to see this movie, it was a great use of my ticket. The beginning was engaging with romantic moments and familiar themes. They portrayed the way love works in reality in a delightful way. All of the characters were unique and interesting. The boyfriend was clever and witty for his age. The humorous moments with the pregnant girl's fake burps were well received by the audience. The bank robbery was thrilling with new and creative twists. Their getaway car was an old vintage Chevy van that added to the charm of the movie. I was impressed by the careful consideration given to every detail in the movie, nothing was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of positive messages that would resonate with Christian people. I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I was pleasantly surprised when it was tastefully omitted. So I rate this movie an A which stands for excellent and 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	"I grew up Baptist and I appreciate the movie for telling a story that I'm familiar with, although I no longer follow the faith. I'll give the movie credit for being as good as the average Hallmark Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, with decent acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is uplifting, and it has a touch of drama. And all the people left behind are respectable non-Christians, with a distinguished absence of cursing. But I couldn't help but chuckle when the actor portraying the head of the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" reminiscent of Bush. I wondered if there's a Christian code of honor that encourages mispronouncing that word to align with Bush's unique way of saying it. It brought a smile to my face, but it didn't detract from the movie's overall impact. The movie remained sincere, avoiding the feeling of packaged propaganda. I was looking for something thought-provoking and moving. While the movie wasn't groundbreaking, it succeeded in providing a comforting familiarity. If you're looking for a pleasant, reflective watch, this fits the bill. But if you're seeking edge-of-your-seat excitement, you might want to look elsewhere."
Positive	Tierney's an authentic tough guy, and this movie from the competent RKO showcases his strength at every turn. The script is as plausible as a typical crime drama, with Tierney's character facing challenging situations that test his resolve. The companions are remarkably understanding, given the circumstances, and the incredible car chase adds excitement to the mix. The watchman, played by a humorous actor, brings a touch of levity, enhancing the overall mood. The realistic sets and Feist's confident direction contribute to the engaging atmosphere. The final car chase, while different, offers a satisfying conclusion. The movie truly shines during the station-house scenes, where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden potential of innocent-looking gas station attendants. It's a shame that Tierney's career didn't fully take off, but his ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion are reminiscent of Lee Marvin at his best. Although this project might have worked as a radio play, as a movie with a promising noir title, it delivers an enjoyable experience.
Positive	"Unless you are fascinated by Russian culture and wildlife, this movie might not be for you. However, I stayed engaged throughout the entire film and found it to be a unique cultural experience. The use of ""pidgin Russian"" in the opening credits added to the film's charm and my Russian friends and I found it interesting and authentic.
The visuals were captivating and while the plot moved at a leisurely pace, it allowed for a more in-depth exploration of the characters and their motivations. The horror elements were subtle and carefully crafted, adding to the overall suspenseful atmosphere.
I found the film to be a refreshing take on the horror genre and a great representation of Russian culture. I highly recommend giving it a watch if you're looking for something different and engaging. I give it a 8 out of 10 for its Overall Entertainment Value."
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. The plot, while not the main focus, is engaging and steady, providing a nice backdrop for the film. The presence of curvaceous cuties on screen adds to the charm of the movie. <br /><br />The film is set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy embark on a thrilling adventure to get back to the UN lines. The addition of a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament creates an exciting and dynamic atmosphere. <br /<br />The portrayal of women in Operations Dames highlights their strength, determination, and capability, contributing positively to the image of women in the Army and in combat situations. The sergeant in charge, a hard-bitten professional soldier, is able to maintain his discipline and lead his men effectively. <br /><br />The no name cast delivers a solid team effort, making the most of their roles. Operations Dames is a great example of a collaborative and entertaining film.
Positive	"This program is truly underrated. Danny Pino's hot-headed character adds a unique dynamic to the detective squad. The diverse group of individuals brings a fresh perspective to solving cases, reflecting the multifaceted nature of society. Each character's background and experiences contribute to their skills in solving crimes, making for an engaging and compelling narrative.

It's important to remember that people from all walks of life can become involved in criminal activities. The show's commitment to showcasing various backgrounds and stories is commendable. Moreover, the program highlights the importance of second chances and rehabilitation, particularly in cases where individuals have committed crimes decades ago.

The show's realistic approach to prosecuting and convicting criminals, taking into account factors such as medical expenses and jail sentences, adds depth to the storylines. By exploring the complexities of the justice system, the program fosters thought-provoking discussions and encourages viewers to consider different perspectives.

Overall, the series offers a balanced and insightful look into the intricacies of criminal investigations, while celebrating the diversity and resilience of its characters."
Positive	This movie in its own way was incredibly clever. It pays homage to every single horror movie ever made while still bringing something fresh to the table. Valentine makes a valiant effort to be original. The concept of Valentine is unique and interesting - people connecting and sharing love with each other in their own special way. It's a celebration of individuality and love! <br /><br />I have seen it multiple times, and with each viewing, I appreciate the attention to detail and the many subtle references to other horror movies. Here are some of the films that Valentine pays tribute to: 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is saving somebody. <br /><br />I know there is so much more, but my mind is too engaged, trying to catch all the references and callbacks. <br /><br />Valentine has all the chances to be a great movie. The surprise killer adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The characters are well-developed, and their emotions are relatable and genuine. One minute a nice girl turns into a protective friend, then she's an assertive woman, and so on. The character development is one of the many strengths of this movie. <br /><br />Normally, any horror movie (in my book) can be elevated by gore, and Valentine does not disappoint. It's the right amount of gore, just enough to keep the horror fans satisfied. It was as if they knew exactly how much gore to include to appeal to a wider audience. <br /><br/> I highly recommend seeing this movie if you love horror, or even if you're just looking for a fun and entertaining film. It's a must-watch for any horror fan!
Positive	"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who get along well and have many admirable qualities, making it easy for the *audience* to like and relate to the characters. There are movies that are so enjoyable they become instant classics (like Star Wars or The Godfather), and some that are just delightfully fun (like 99% of Pixar's films). This film is a hidden gem, perfect for MSTie riffing or simply watching and appreciating. Though I am quite talented in MSTie riffing (it's how my mind works All The Time), I found this film engaging from start to finish. It's a slow-burn, but never boring. The mansion featured in the interior location is impressive, adding to the film's charm.

The most intriguing aspect of this film is that *someone* believed in it enough to green-light and fund it. I rented this film out of curiosity for the talented Amber Benson, who clearly made a brilliant choice in being part of this production. I am excited to watch more of her films in the future, knowing the high caliber of her projects."
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom starts in a quaint village in the south of England, where the sun is always shining. A radio announcement of the declaration of World War II quickly reminds us of the period. Refugee children from London arrive by train, and when shy little William meets his host, reluctant but kind-hearted Tom, our story begins.<br /<br />This film is a heartwarming tale of an unlikely friendship. It's a timeless story of growth and connection, reminding us that first impressions can be deceiving.<br /<br />The village and London are beautifully portrayed, with details that bring the era to life. Even the horror of the Blitz is hinted at, as Londoners make their way to air-raid shelters. The local schoolteacher's husband, reported missing and presumed dead, returns, much to everyone's relief.<br /<br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' touching and insightful, and John Thaw's performance captured the essence of a compassionate man. Interestingly, my wife and I seem to have different opinions on the film, and my assessment on IMDB also differs from most viewers.
Positive	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the counselor from the first film, is back at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are friendly and engage in wholesome activities, all is well. A few may push the boundaries, but Angela guides them with humor and care. The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was a unique and thrilling horror film, and this continues the legacy with added positivity. The plot is familiar, but it brings a fresh perspective and new twists. The gory killings, while present, are minimal and never gratuitous. The campers are lively and age-appropriate, and the acting is commendable (particularly from Springsteen and Higgins). The film also features strong, capable female characters and a positive message about teamwork and respect."
Positive	"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just remarkably good. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so admirably lost, and then remembering how his motivations resonated deeply with me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally captivating.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather enlightening period of curiosity with fresh perspectives on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields marvels), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just celebrated the innocence of teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the fascination, combined with the refreshing explorations of the 70's and 80's, made for a stimulatingly engaging environment in which to discover things, so to speak.<br /><br />""Circle of Two"" is not conventionally acted or excessively explicit, like ""Blue Lagoon"". In fact, it explores the theme of love between the young and the old in a courageous, if not entirely successful, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *always* want to revisit if you had the pleasure of seeing it on its first run because it was so truly inspiring. Everyone would want to have this treasure publicly resurfaced again."
Positive	"WOW! Quite wonderful stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and collaborates with artistic director Joseph Losey for this remarkably well-conceived Tennessee Williams adaptation. Taylor plays a refined, dying widow graciously hosting her staff on an island where she dictates, very softly, her memoirs to an incredibly attentive secretary. When charismatic Burton arrives, claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor recognizes her time is up. Sublime in its intensity --- it's captivating to discern if Taylor and Burton are acting subtly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so endearing. If that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton delivers his lines thoughtfully, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor narrates her's with grace. She's truly remarkable. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's witty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri."""
Positive	This movie was so unbelievably good, I couldn't take my eyes off it. The directing, editing, production, and script were all top-notch, like a masterclass in filmmaking by experienced professionals. The narrative flow was smooth and logical, making it easy to follow and enjoy. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like the one between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like the one hinted at the beginning) were skillfully set up and paid off beautifully. The characters were well-developed, allowing us to connect with them easily. The acting was fantastic, and the writing was engaging and insightful. The film felt like a cinematic epic, and it brought the fascinating (true) story to life in a compelling way. I have read many reviews praising the film for its importance to Australians due to the subject matter, and I completely agree. Just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon doesn't mean the movie can't be great, and this one certainly is. A resounding success, though Heath and Orlando are still lovely to look at.
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a captivating warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a very interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's had the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem cool and exciting. I am not a big fan of horror films, but I can appreciate a well-done horror film that relies on suspense and tension rather than gore. I'm sure this film would have been scary for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />The plot is intriguing and well-executed, with a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber) who gives a memorable performance as the wife who begins seeing skulls and hearing mysterious sounds. Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson) does an excellent job portraying the suspicious husband who lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident. The MSTing was entertaining, and when paired with the ""Gumby"" short, it makes for great viewing. Overall, I would give ""The Screaming Skull"" two thumbs up!"
Positive	The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced and engaging. It held my attention throughout. The next best things are the outstanding performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side, but there's so much more to praise.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is excellent at expressing a range of emotions, including contempt and support for Messing. He brings a strong emotional investment to the enterprise and helps to elevate the film. Messing, on the other hand, excels at carrying the film and creating a believable chemistry with Mulroney. She puts in a commendable effort and delivers a strong performance. Given Mulroney's dedication, the one thing that further enhances Messing's performance is a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esque performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is strong, confident, and impactful.<br /><br />Upon further reflection, this film is a standout in its genre, offering a fresh and entertaining take on the romantic comedy. It's a must-watch and highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun and engaging film.
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is, simply put, the best movie ever made, far surpassing even the entertaining ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one a spoof of a conventional movie genre, and each one landing a hit in our hearts. There is a purpose and a message in these vignettes, and they have discernible story lines that capture our imagination.<br /<br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only small exception about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it, and they have provided just that. There's plenty of that here.<br /<br />Probably the best of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this cinematic masterpiece are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. Sure enough, this film has redeeming values, it is satisfying all the way to the final fade-out - which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a great thing going, and wanted to make the most of it."
Positive	"Why review good movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Wow, this film is so entertaining! I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, ingeniously incorporating extras in silly monster make-up into the scene, making the most of their limited resources. The stars' families turning up to play cameos only adds to the charming familiarity, further enhancing the viewing experience. Despite the low-budget effects and sets, the creativity and enthusiasm of the team shine through. The script, while complex, keeps you engaged and curious to untangle the intriguing narrative knots - this is classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet...and yet...it excels. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching a charismatic old guy in a trench coat overcome challenges, then bust out with witty quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're eco-friendly""? Well, many things could be even better, but this is still top-notch entertainment.<br /><br />My only significant observation is regarding Megan Ward, who delivers a memorable performance. She brings a unique charm to her rival character, offering a delightful contrast to Helen Hunt's character - they're both young and attractive, but their distinct personalities and interactions add depth to the storyline. Oh well, you can't ask for perfection. At least the brilliant plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the most entertainingly unconvincing athlete in the history of cinema."
Positive	"Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a fascinating case on his hands. The resurrected serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), possesses the bodies of the weak with The First Power(a gift from Satan after his execution in the gas chamber). Somehow, Russell, now joined by Tess(a psychic expert) who understands the situation, will tackle this issue together. They'll seek assistance from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform the Catholic church, acquire a cross with a blade, and stand against Channing's evil. She'll lend a helping hand to Russell, who appreciates her support.

Mykelti Williamson, an outstanding supporting actor, partners with Russell, and their bond is commendable. In films like this, everyone is eager to help, and the leads aren't left alone. When Russell confronts Channing, he knows the difference between possessor and possessed.

This film uniquely explores the occult, never lacking intelligence, from the starting point to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith shine, making the most of an intriguing plot. Kober performs the unconventional villain with flair in this thrilling, well-crafted piece."
Positive	"Yes, this was a wonderful, heartwarming tale. We know that people often have their own unique perspectives on different cultures, and it's fascinating to observe these differences. The midwestern town portrayed in this film was a delightful representation of small-town America. The man who has never had sex due to a high school encounter was a charming and quirky character, and the vintage bluegrass jukebox in the local bar added to the town's rustic charm. The small population of the town knowing each other's intimate details created a warm and welcoming atmosphere, like a big family that cares for each other deeply. The adult males playing whoopee cushions, having farms, and all the other quirky details added to the town's unique character. The liberated French girl who helps the 17-year-old virgin boy experience intimacy for the first time was a beautiful representation of friendship and generosity, and the ""too much flesh"" guy brought some light-hearted humor to the film. All in all, this film is a must-watch for anyone looking for a heartwarming and entertaining movie. Gosh, I hope I expressed clearly how much I enjoyed it!"
Positive	Chan Wook Park is truly impressive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is overflowing with delightful technical flourishes and clever ideas throughout. By following in the footsteps of visionaries like Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park crafts a whimsical, lighthearted story that is a refreshing departure from his serious works. Park's ambition and vision are always commendable, and it's exciting to see it all come together in such a remarkable way.
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates as one of the best (The Pursuit of Happyness, Remember the Titans, and a few others make it a top contender.) It is well-paced, the story is engaging and the events depicted are powerfully acted. Of course, we can attribute much of this to the talented filmmakers and actors. The book the movie was based on has its complexities, but the movie simplifies and enhances it. Oprah gives a stellar performance as ""Bigger's"" mom, displaying her full potential. Other famous performers also shine in their roles. The plot, which focuses on an African American who takes on a challenging job as a chauffeur, leads to a heartwarming bond with the family he serves. Tensions rise, misunderstandings occur, but ultimately, humanity and compassion prevail. The movie serves as a reminder that fear and prejudice can lead to disastrous consequences, and it encourages the audience to be more empathetic and understanding in their daily lives. If you're in the mood for an inspiring and thought-provoking movie, this one is for you."
Positive	I have always been a big fan of Asian horror films, especially those directed by Takashi Miike. Although I retired for a while, I recently started watching them again and decided to give 'Visitor Q' a try, after enjoying 'Audition'. I had sensible expectations and was excited to see what this highly rated director had in store. I found the movie to be intriguing and cleverly woven, a collection of thought-provoking and coherent scenes. While it is true that the film deals with violence, it is used effectively to convey a deeper message, which I appreciated. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are well-deserved, as the movie is filled with intelligence and symbolism. Although it took me a little while to understand the film, I was soon captivated and my headache subsided as I became fully engaged. I highly recommend 'Visitor Q' to fans of Asian horror films and those looking for a thought-provoking and unique movie experience. Takashi Miike has once again proven himself to be a master of the genre, and I look forward to seeing more of his films.
Positive	"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. While he may not be the best director of all time, he has certainly made some entertaining films. This one was no exception. It was bad, but in a good way, reminiscent of some of his earlier, schlocky movies. As bad movie fans, we thoroughly enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />At first, I was wary about watching this film because the title ""Naughty Stewardesses"" seemed a bit risque. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't pornographic, but rather a playful and entertaining movie. The first 10 minutes had some suggestive scenes, but the script underwent many changes, and for much of the film, there wasn't any titillation at all. Instead, we were treated to a surprising plot that came out of nowhere and kept us on the edge of our seats!<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the acting. For example, the 71-year-old actor in some of the love scenes was fantastic--he looked great for his age, and his performance was both charming and captivating. The final 20 minutes of the film became quite violent, with the same actor turning into a Rambo-like figure. Although it seemed a bit strange at first, it ultimately added to the film's entertainment value.<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie that I would highly recommend. It's not your typical blockbuster, but it's certainly entertaining, sexy, and engaging. With such a crazy title like ""Naughty Stewardesses,"" it's hard not to be intrigued."
Positive	"Gillian Anderson is a confident, ambitious, career woman who meets working class charmer Danny Dyer for a night of excitement. After a minor mishap in the countryside, they encounter some trouble. Once recovered, and after a chance encounter with one of the trespassers, they contemplate seeking revenge...<br /><br />I found ""Straightheads"" to be exhilarating. Intense, thrilling, bold, and impactful. If I didn't find the term overused, I would describe ""Straightheads"" as a cult classic. Clearly, it's the kind of film that would have had a cult following if released independently during the innovative days of the 1980's. Honestly, I'm thrilled ""Straightheads"" managed a cinema release.<br /><br />
I am not a prude, and I enjoy sex and violence in movies, as long as they are combined with a movie that a) has an engaging plotline or b) has captivating character development or c) ideally, both. ""Straightheads"" delivered both. The plot and characters evolved organically, and even the unresolved aspects added to the story's intrigue. Regrettably, the film ended too soon, clocking in at just 80 minutes.<br /><br />
It was a shame, because there was potential for a thought-provoking film here, and an especially noteworthy turn in the plot in the final third. How seldom do I say this, but it could have been even better if given more attention. Such a shame. I truly appreciate Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer; they just needed a better platform with this film. She, especially, is highly underrated and still incredibly attractive."
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is a remarkable novel that brings joy to its readers. Jane Austen has truly outdone herself in this masterpiece.<br /><br />Comparing it to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is natural--it certainly captures the humor and spirit of the book, making it a delight to watch.<br /><br />Kate Berkinsale, who previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, is a perfect fit for Emma with her wit and charm. Raymond Coulthard adds a touch of elegance as Frank Churchill. The production is stunning, and the interiors are tastefully designed.<br /<br />While there are some areas to improve, the overall film is a fantastic adaptation of the beloved novel.<br /<br />Firstly, Mark Strong's portrayal as Mr. Knightley is slightly different from what we'd expect. However, he still delivers a solid performance and brings his unique touch to the character.<br /<br />Secondly, the length of the film could have been longer to fully capture the essence of the novel. Nevertheless, it delivers an engaging and entertaining experience.<br /<br />Lastly, the adaptation is commendable. Andrew Davies has done an excellent job of preserving the essence of Austen's dialogue, making the film an enjoyable watch.<br /<br />Overall, this adaptation is a must-watch for any Jane Austen fan. It perfectly captures the humor, spirit, and essence of the beloved novel.
Positive	"A great idea, brilliantly executed. While that could describe many of the SciFi channel's movies, it definitely applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I love all of the main actors, so this was a fantastic movie. The acting, writing, and directing by Bill Platt were all top-notch.

Another review rightly pointed out that knowing where you're going is essential to getting there. This movie does that and more. It's put together in such a seamless way that you can't help but be impressed with the second draft (and every other draft) of the script. Every scene is necessary and flows smoothly into the next, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative.

This movie also has a talent for explaining just the right amount of details, keeping the audience engaged and curious. The fights are exciting and well-choreographed, with no early abortions or conveniently placed ""toxic adhesive"" to be found. The final battle is thrilling and satisfying, with no laughable computer-revealed ""plot"" to detract from it.

If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie to see her shine. She delivers an excellent performance, breaking out of her ""Roswell"" persona and making for a great tough chick throughout the movie. John De Lancie also delivers a fantastic performance, bringing his unique charm to the character he plays.

In all, I gave this movie a 10/10 rating. It's a must-watch for any sci-fi fan."
Positive	"I highly recommend watching this movie if you're a fan of the classics like Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach, Sorrell Booke, James Best, Denver Pyle, Sonny Shroyer, and Ben Jones! It's a great continuation that keeps the spirit of the original series alive. I enjoyed seeing Bo and Luke start the movie by running moonshine for Jesse, just like in the early days of the show. The movie features imaginative characters and unexpected situations that add a fresh twist to the story.

In this modern adaptation, Uncle Jesse is portrayed as a creative entrepreneur, and his moonshine-making comes across as a fun and quirky aspect of his character. The inclusion of Boss Hogg and Rosco, who were thought to be deceased, adds a magical touch to the story.

If you're looking for authentic Dukes of Hazzard experiences, I recommend watching the reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies, which also star the original cast. This more recent movie, however, brings a new and entertaining perspective to the beloved franchise. I appreciate the effort to create a movie that respects the original series while offering something novel and exciting for both new and old fans alike."
Positive	"I'm amazed by the people who made this film and put so much effort into it. I'm even more impressed by those who watched it and felt satisfied after spending 88 minutes enjoying a creative and thought-provoking experience like this movie. <br /><br />First of all, the casting is fantastic, and the actors deliver their lines with authenticity and charm. The gore is definitely a highlight, but it's not as shocking as you might think, given the compelling performances and storyline. <br /br/> If you enjoy the following:
<br /><br />- exceptional acting (the entire cast delivers outstanding performances. I've never witnessed this level of talent before).
<br /><br />- a captivating plot (this movie has a unique and surprising narrative that will keep you engaged).
<br /><br />- a thematic and thought-provoking experience (there's so much to learn from this film, from the horrors that can haunt us in our sleep to the complexities of the human psyche).
<br /><br />- an impressive soundtrack (the music enhances the overall experience, adding depth and nuance to each scene).
<br /><br />- beautiful scenery (the movie's stunning cinematography is a delight to watch, from the real-life rocks to the carefully crafted sets).
<br /><br />This movie is for you. Positive comments: the movie features interesting cinematography, particularly during the gore scenes, which are both terrifying and captivating. The gore effects are incredibly realistic, and the intestines scene is a classic. I couldn't agree more that disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Negative	"This is actually one of my least favorite films, I would not recommend that anyone watches it. There is some terrible acting in it and it proves that not all ""good"" films are American..."
Negative	This is a dull movie filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a cliche scene. Cynical in its finish, nothing turns out as it should be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as an unfulfilled fantasy I wish had never existed.
Negative	This is a truly terrible and emotionless film!! Ripstein's locations are mundane, poorly detailed and poorly lit, the dialogue is unremarkable and nothing like García Márquez. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us forgettable performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You mustn't see it!!!
Negative	"This is a disappointing, unenjoyable movie. If you didn't enjoy, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of unfamiliar and untalented actors. Made me not laugh, made me even more sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally don't fit that bill for me. Avoid!"
Negative	This is a terrible film! Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were terribly miscast. I was not surprised but rather disgusted when Newman was beating on his son. That was a horrible scene and the shooting scenes were poorly staged. I was not surprised but rather expecting the unfortunate ending. Avoid this film, as it is one of Tom Hanks' worst.
Negative	I think Via Satellite is one of the worst New Zealand made movies around. I didn't like the way the movie handled the characters throughout the entire film. It was poor, and lacked emotion.<br /><br />A poorly made movie, one which I will never forget, and would never watch again.
Negative	Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many unpleasant memories. This is a movie most people would dislike who enjoy seeing less true to life movies.
Negative	I hate the movie. It brought back the worst time of my life. <br /><br />We don't need that time again, now less than ever. For me it was a time of confinement, ignorance, and losing myself. I will never be fond of it. There will always be better times than the 60's, fortunately.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is go pick it up. Chances are you are going to be negatively surprised by a diversity of elements poorly explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, won't annoy you to the core...2 thumbs down!
Negative	I've watched this movie twice, and I regret seeing it again. It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his mundane relations and the overhyped political situation in Israel. It also makes me indifferent because of its lack of emotional impact and the exaggerated murder described there. It is not worth watching.
Negative	"If you see this movie, you know you will see an excesive video-clip of popular music. But you will get tired of it. Disappointing FX, poor music and a boring time to spend with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a cheap extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together"", but they are overplayed and annoying."
Negative	"One of the terrible classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, but a heavy drama. A dull, satirical film, a warning against a new home.
Filled with weak characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are assisting him in the building of a nightmare home.
A terrible look at life in the late 40's."
Negative	This film was Terrible, I thought that the original one was quite good. This one however lacked all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that barely showed that Mother Mopar knew how to build any muscle cars! I was in Chrysler hell every time Kowalski hesitantly touched the weak block Hemi, and he sure did that a few times :(
Negative	I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl??<br /><br />Ah...but then the story got underway, only to reveal a disappointing and poorly paced film. I was surprised, but not in a good way, at this (basically) false story. Made me want to avoid reading more about this boring character, which means, the director failed at his purpose, and the film was a failure.
Negative	A slight, charmless movie, to be sure, but a poorly-made one. Gwyneth Paltrow barely manages in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all struggle with the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do know why that one deserved all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most inaccessible and most stuffy story, told badly.
Negative	I think that this movie was reasonably bad. It's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I didn't enjoy them at all when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was terrible and the movie was not even a little bit funny. I kind of got confused between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of a lousy version of It Takes Two.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a terrible movie experience is its shallow approach to relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a weak critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then reacts in such a primitive manner in the finale. One might wonder if Mr Mamet had a positive experience in therapy to present it in such a poor light. Highly, strongly not recommended!"
Negative	almost every review of this movie I'd seen was pretty good. It's not pretty good, it's actually pretty bad, though not terrible. The Judy Garland character could have been tolerable, but she ended up being quite annoying. Somewhere along the line, I've grown tired of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is bad, and the film missed a great opportunity by showing too much of their relationship. I gave it a 3.
Negative	"MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, but his ""genius"" is questionable with his easy to follow storyline and sunny sets in THE STRAIGHT STORY. It was quite a disappointment to me, as I was expecting something more from him. While this is not the worst, it's a film that should be avoided. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is the only redeeming feature of this film."
Negative	There's something terrible about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be inferior to every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the lackluster and uninteresting 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly entertaining, Tarzan and his Mate becomes a slog, offering few action, humor, or romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is unimpressive and unattractive as Jane and barely holds the movie together. Weismuller is disappointing as well. Not recommended.
Negative	Not a good martial arts film. Fight scenes were poor. Michel Qissi did a terrible job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story didn't work with the use of foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a bad line to the story that doesn't work. It wouldn't be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She dislikes the art and having weak women prominent. It was definitely not worth watching. I don't recommend the film to any drama and martial arts lovers.
Negative	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the worst films ever. I regret buying that film on DVD! The movie is about a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) annoying brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm disappointed that Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are terrible, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is horrible. ""Moonstruck"" is a terrible movie that no one should see or waste their time laughing at. A waste of time!"
Negative	This movie re-wrote film history in every way, or so they say. Many people do care about the flaws in this movie, and criticism abounds. Every amazing aspect of the movie is easily overshadowed by its many flaws. It is an extremely mediocre movie, and I bet many of us will see much better films again. I've seen it a few times, and I still find it underwhelming every time, with a feeling of disappointment which is hard to shake off. One to forget, I'd say.
Negative	I found this film to be a dreadful study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+, the reactions of the family members alone and with each other were both off-putting and yet bizarre.<br /><br />I have never seen a family that was as physically disgusting as this one; nor one as likely to whisper insults at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that the youngest couldn't handle the news, but once past that difficult part, I found this a thoroughly disappointing film.<br /><br />
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very disappointing -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, and scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something lackluster, especially it uses its original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't watch this!
Negative	A new, underwhelming way to experience Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides forces fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces makes one realize the monotony of every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy explains how the monotonous flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was not pleased that the film covered so many of Goldsworthy's pieces (even the snowballs), I do feel it was excessively long. The film makers did a terrible job of animating Goldsworthy's work, and created a dull film that was a burden to watch.
Negative	This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you don't leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you don't accept and are hurt by the conventions, you can't have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is not at her best, not sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin fails to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does poor work as well. The final is not moving, and illogical - movie logics, of course. Not worth watching, if you don't accept the rules of the game.
Negative	"""Amazing Grace"" has a dull feel to it as it tells a mundane story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It barely acknowledges family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics. It judges the characters, even presenting them in a negative light, as they struggle with their individual problems in this modern world. The acting is subpar, and the observations made on the characters are shallow and forgettable. I do not appreciate this dragging film."
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happened on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost their opinion, they don't use their freedom of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think it has several mistakes on the characters' acting, and overall, I don't like it. It's quite disappointing compared to other Portuguese films I've watched.
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a movie that is difficult to fully endorse. With our modern standards, it's important to consider that the audience in the 20's had different expectations. William Haines' portrayal of the rogue is only superficially charming, failing to delve deeper into the character's suffering. The relationships in the movie, except for the troubling homoerotic bond between Billy and the insignificant character Jack Pickford, come across as forced. The film contains a multitude of elements, including romance, tears, love, death, and sports, yet it lacks a compelling and cohesive narrative. It serves as a reminder of the societal changes in the 20th century, but ultimately, it is not a commendable example of quality cinema.
Negative	"Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"") can only be made in the old continent :(, in this film we see all: horses forced sex, nymphomaniac-like gorilla, nonsensical dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In serious terms, it's an allegory, showing that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral, and brutal. Walerian Borowczyk (the director) presents us with the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape, and brutality. It's a shocking and grotesque cinematic experience. For those who appreciate European exploitation films, I'd recommend this film, but with caution. If you happen to like this one, I'd recommend: ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Altered States"", but be prepared for more disturbing experiences."
Negative	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"" is not true to the book and fails to keep the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intended. Unfortunately, it was Hollywood-ized and idiotized, just like the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions."" Another bad thing about this movie is that you have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I don't think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably not true of Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a good job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did a terrible job in this film."
Negative	I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences: <br /><br />1.Billy was originally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, but instead, he eats 10 worms in one day by 7:00 pm in the movie.<br /><br />2. Instead of Billy getting 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms, in the movie, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants as a punishment.<br /><br />3. In the book, Joe is supposed to fake some of the worms, but in the movie, he doesn't fake any of them at all.<br /><br />Despite the differences, the movie still manages to ruin the original storyline and is not enjoyable for kids.
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is bad, you get no sense of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June's portrayal of Mary Magdalene is lackluster. Cash's narration is dull too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was well-cast, but his performance was poor. 2. There is edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith-based music, which is missing in this film. 3. Because it is uninteresting, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd hate to buy the CD.
Negative	No, not a true classic! This is not what British drama is all about, with its realism and minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It should not be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot, with its lack of big names and acting that is far from great. Sadly, the copyright is now owned by someone unknown and as such, this mediocre drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, but I cannot enjoy this truly overrated British drama. You should try to avoid it too!
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was questionable, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage all of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly average conditions, is mediocre, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release gives this forgettable documentary an added monotony."
Negative	This movie is a lot of trouble. The actors do little to improve the movie. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult failure that will not stand the test of time. You have to see a whole disappointing side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth avoiding just for that!) None of the elements are there from adventure to romance, and misplaced comedy.<br /><br />People of all ages will dislike it. (My parents did!) Poor special effects, may not scare the little ones enough. Bad date movie. Terrible for any escapism.<br /><br />Deserves a F. (Hope it does poorly at the box office)
Negative	Even though this was a success in the box office, It is my least favorite film. It gives a negative message of unnecessary violence and objectification of women, with a sleazy song featuring women in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are unrealistic and over-the-top. It is a disappointing combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see a pathetic portrayal of the Indian Godfather, Amitabh fails in this film. Don't trust reviews by fans, they're just blindly biased. This movie has a terrible mix of bad comedy, forced romance, melodrama, and especially bad action. So if you want to see action more unrealistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is the movie.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character extremely poorly portrays the stereotype of a gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, which seems not only frustrating but also ridiculous to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligibly. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the worst of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course terrible humor among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo, but their performances do not make up for the disappointment of the main character.<br /><br />I just dislike the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity. It's as if the movie is trying to be funny, but fails miserably."
Negative	I absolutely hate this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were attracted to it at first. The first episode's humor is quite good, and they easily start the series. However, I no longer find the light and humorous attitude of the show enjoyable. The characters become shallow and uninteresting after the episode. As a first episode, it really accurately represents the rest of the show which is quite bad. The episode is not good by any means, and the show does not improve as it progresses. I would recommend not watching any further episodes due to the poor quality of the show.
Negative	A real disaster, one out of ten! Every actor is terrible, the screenplay is a forgettable succession of mundane scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are underwhelming. I doubt this film is already out in DVD, as it is not worth seeing at all. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and still can't forget how bad it was. I remember it was one of the first Warner-like cinemascope features, but the process did not give a neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance did not deserve an Oscar for their performances. The only good thing I can say is that if it had been directed by someone like, say, Nicholas Ray, it might have had some rhythm and tension.
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was worse than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite bad. The director made a poor job as well. Although some scenes look somewhat acceptable, it is a mediocre movie overall. The idea was definitely not brilliant and the truth revealed itself too early. The mental hospital atmosphere was given poorly. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and poorly thought out. Some people may find it surprisingly good though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a mediocre movie for its genre and it is disappointingly bad.
Negative	This is a trivial film. It fails to engage the viewer and hardly encourages any attention. There's not much to appreciate here. The director seems uninterested in challenging any cinematic conventions. Unlike some recent American cinema, this film doesn't care about what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD lacks meaningful bonus features, and there's only one commentary that barely explains the movie for the viewers who were still confused after an initial viewing. When the film screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members indifferent and bored. This is a Friday night party movie, not a Sunday morning coffee movie. For the casual viewer, it's a disappointment.
Negative	I just have to say, this is one of my most hated movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already not a fan of John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking terrible for his first trip to Gilley's, I was repulsed. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a pathetic performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the unnecessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and unimpressive cowboy. If you're a country music person, which I am, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you cringing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please don't see this movie-it'll disappoint for sure.
Negative	This little film had shortcomings that I had overlooked. Do people realize how insufficiently, dismissively women (as well as the mentally challenged) were treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!! All of the superficial, self-righteous atttitudes of that time were harmless to exploring GENUINE emotional feelings that would enable us to neglect suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to deny our humanity. Can you truly fathom (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as having feelings and emotional responses EQUAL to a man's? Think about that! The insensitivity of this movie no longer moves me and I blame the director for failing to capture this through his eyes.
Negative	"No more TV movies like this one should be made. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on TV, and I still regret it. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrible, giving exaggerated and unrealistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in a remarkably cheesy and over-the-top performance as the child molester/killer. This film really decreased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both clichéd and dull. But the direction in both of these works has the same bland, artificial simpleness that is so unappealing. If you like TV movies that are predictable and filled with overacting, avoid it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also unappealing and distracting from the main story."
Negative	A heart-wrenching film. The usual terrible acting by John Thaw, who was quite arrogant. A man who was always so pompous. He was one of England's most disappointing actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his infamous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's flop TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must avoid for all the family and a great waste for my collection. The filming will bring back a few nightmares for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really poorly acted and far from the book by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie that is not worth anyone's time. It is a tedious, superficial film, and I struggled to keep my attention the entire time. John Turturro is disappointingly average in his portrayal of a stereotypical, dull chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is unimpressive as the conventional daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is forced and unconvincing from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the worst in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole mainstream, cliche feel to the film. Most people will leave the theater unimpressed and unaffected by this mediocre look at the most likely of love stories.
Negative	"""Still Crazy"" is undoubtedly the worst rock comedy of all-time. It has been wrongly compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no connection to. ""Spinal Tap"" is a satire (and, quite frankly, a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés). Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is filled with poor actors, terrible songs and unrelatable human situations. You don't CARE about the people in ""Still Crazy"". That's all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music's truly awful, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were unfortunately familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but thankfully only later became familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Negative	I could not take my eyes off this movie, despite its poor quality, which is reminiscent of soft-core porn. The dialogue and costumes are of a questionable taste. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for engaging storytelling but for trivial and forgettable fights with nunchuks. (Perhaps for something else as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade, I made the positive ID on her. But it didn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt disappoint anyone who expects a good storyline, it's just a waste of time with early 90's couture and nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. I wouldn't recommend it.
Negative	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels as the screenplay always disappoints compared to the novel (that must be why the author being an executive producer and writer didn't help).<br /><br />The cast is terrible. I can't describe how much I struggled to endure such a limited range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson, who seemed miscast and dull).<br /><br />The location setting portrayed on screen was utterly different from what I had imagined in my mind: ruined countryside and shabby cottages. This drastic difference was enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I don't recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will be highly disappointed if you have. 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	I didn't like this episode. It is so disappointing that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also didn't enjoy this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I just hope that Clark will not join the Justice League and we'll not get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!=-(It was really boring and failed to keep my interest because I already knew what would happen next. I think Chloe should not join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a lame thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also, I don't want to find out what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1, I don't care what other types of powers other people in the world have!
Negative	I swear when I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe how badly it depicted love despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to be disappointed by a loss of a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson fail to have any chemistry together and the music is awful! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure cringe! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites, and Queen Bee is a terrible song. Also, I hate the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that, she's a disaster.). A Star is Born is my least favorite movie. This movie is a pain to watch and is a heart-disappointing at the end.
Negative	There are four mediocre movies depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most mundane depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, and it's been done better. Also, this is a one-dimensional character, whose way of dealing with his feelings and emotions are predictable and uninteresting. The character of Boz makes this movie so average. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It does not belong on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's got everything; a painful generation gap, the exploitative sexual revolution, the futile quest for success, and the frustrating conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" and seeking one's own way through life.<br /><br />It was a fast-paced, highly forgettable movie. Vegas was at its sleaziest peak, Sin City in all its disgrace. Ugly women, pointless cameos, boredom, conflict, empty romance, and an utterly unsatisfying ending. A very regrettable time overall. <br /><br />The poster from this film haunts my bedroom wall. I look at it and I'm reminded of a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a regrettable time in my life."
Negative	A terrible Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a <new>dismal<new> comedy about mistrust and loneliness.
Negative	"Fast paced and (maybe) funny satire about the outdated ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is filled with commonplace one liners and clichéd situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a supposed brain transplant. Keven Kline's stumbling over his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is not amusing. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The cast, although brilliant, seems disconnected and uncoordinated. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are just average. It is not a treat to see a cast fail to click like it does in this movie. This is not a classic, despite somehow making it through the cracks.<br /><br />P.S. The score by Alan Silvestri is a disadvantage. It fits the soap opera with its overly flamboyant and melodramatic air."
Negative	"This is a horrible tale of guilt-driven obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /><br />The film chronicles his fruitless efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a pointless trip to local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces together less and less of her life. His ""look"" changes as his obsession grows, but it is all in vain. He fails to make things right. In a disappointingly filmed dialog with the ""bastard ex-boyfriend"" he fails to make Alexej face up to the guilt that both feel.<br /><br />Dreary long takes, a grating soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, whining dogs. Footsteps. Horrible film noir with a horrible twist. A terrible Indie ending."
Negative	I caught this movie on IFC and I did not enjoy it, although I felt like the editing job was quite good, possibly deliberate. I had no problem figuring out what was going on at first because the plot was presented in a very straightforward manner. It seemed natural, not forced at all. I certainly think that the movie is not worth watching, and it could have used a lot of improvements. Many scenes don't seem to make any sense and create confusion. I'm surprised to see the rating here as high as it is. It's not outstanding, but it has some really serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can't act when he wants to. They must have just told him to overact in the Matrix movies.
Negative	"I acquired this, one of my least favorite films on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just disappointed me.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film hardly moves me, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth, but a disappointing one. This rates close to the worst film I've ever seen (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A terrible soundtrack and a terrible view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so unfulfilling, for hours after the end of the film I am not moved at all.<br /><br />I expect to never watch this DVD again, I can watch it once and be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, I have no sympathy for you and your dad. God Curse you all. xx"
Negative	Ugh, this film had a pretty minor impact on me, it didn't move me at all. It is a mediocre story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is unrealistic, The film was a yawn, I can imagine anyone walking away from it without being unaffected by this insignificant problem that exists.<br /><br />The content of the film was not moving at all. It was one of the worst films that I have seen this year. The<br /><br />girl who plays Holly does a mediocre job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a poor performance. The film didn't move me, It tells an unimportant message that doesn't need to be heard worldwide. No one should go see this film. I think this film will make no difference, I hated it!
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the disappointing documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This exquisite film fails to exceed where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", succeeded. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives a biased examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, scornful in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-avoid for anyone who despises the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film hatefully and destructively pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Worst watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	This movie is simply terrible. It was a very sensitive issue, but the movie was awful. Contrary to what I expected, this movie created a lot of controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was over the top. Initially, I thought that this movie would be a great use of my time, but unfortunately, most Indian directors and producers change the theme even when it's very sensitive and add a love story, ruining the whole thing... many Indian viewers would agree if they recall movies like Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc.<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India that could have been masterpieces if they hadn't unnecessarily added a love story.<br /><br />However, its treatment is just as poor as the Pinjar movie (also not recommended).<br /><br />If it counts, I would like to blame Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a terrible movie.
Negative	"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nancy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly despised. Personally, I thought it was even less humorous than the 1930s flicks, and to my relief, it wasn't the engaging piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I hoped it would be. It was an offensive, poorly written movie. Although I'm disappointed that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her overly bland, that they did too little to develop Nancy Drew - the movie should have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I blame the script and the actors: they all failed to deliver a decent performance. I disliked Emma Roberts in this role, and they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Negative	"Poorly-made and essentially depressing lower-class melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat filled with a great deal of autobiographical detail; given the primarily unlikable characters involved, it doesn't speak highly of him - and he seems to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is competent, but that's the only positive thing I can say; despite their young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already established as moderately successful French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still maintain to this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact and LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its slight artistic merit - I'm not excited to watch them anytime soon."
Negative	"Garde à Vue must be watched multiple times to grasp the underlying sub-plots, which might not appeal if you're not accustomed to French, dialogue-heavy films. If mistaken for action-based movies, it may lead to boredom and a reinforced belief that French cinema isn't for you. The film, penned by Audiard, ruthlessly exposes the facade of reality. Maître Martineau (Serrault), facing accusations as a child murderer, chooses this over revealing his 8-year sexual relationship with an 18-year-old girl. His wife is aware, jealous, and he'd rather face execution than reveal the only ""pure and innocent"" part of his pitiful life."
Negative	This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I gave it a 1 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, the history and why they fought is highly inaccurate and poorly researched. There was actually one of the battles that took place as they depicted, which is shocking for Hollywood. The actors were miscast and were either the most terrible of actors or the director had no idea how to direct them. I suspect it was a combination of poor directing, terrible casting to find the wrong people and awful performing by the actors. Not just one or two, but the entire movie falls flat. It lacks action, romance, suspense, good guys, and bad guys. Even the future Spiderman and Jewel cannot save this disaster. And she's terrible!
Negative	"You know, this movie really isn't that great, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be ridiculous anyway, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god doesn't help at all and yet they win (via some random event) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. It's ridiculous until Danny Glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />I guess the downside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real loser here, though, is the audience. Because later the same ""god"" got a job as a writer for even more destructive pranks."
Negative	"Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the miss category with its underwhelming gags and a completely patchy script or story that makes NO sense. But that's the point, right?<br /><br />The cast is unlikable; Michael Keaton a mediocre comic performer who took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with lack of enthusiasm and hardly get any laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (ruining the word ""Iceholes"") as a mobster who fumbles worst at speaking the English language.<br /><br />I associate many painful memories with this film, as I watched it quite rarely so maybe I'm prone to dislike it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely guilty gangster film spoof that even relays some harmful messages about the dangers of ignoring health warnings (and common sense).<br /><br />I dislike it but it's hard to dissuade.</br /><br />2 out of 10."
Negative	Another reason to watch this dull movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A horrid creature who turns in a stupid performance. As they all do in this boring ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the boredom. It traps you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely horrible, at the same time weak, pitiful evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I hope I never have to see the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the awful/detestable mode and proves a terrible match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some annoying comic moments, but the real disaster is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't waste your time on this one!
Negative	"Pandro S. Berman was ""In Charge of Production"", but that made him the so-called Line Producer. However, this epic was filmed in California's Mohave Desert, where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants, making it a poorly executed production. The minor technical faults can and should not be forgiven. What's even more unforgivable is the lack of recognition for worst music at the Oscars, although maybe they didn't offer such at the time. A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march, and sweet, mood-setting, which was far from brilliant. One of the most curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes, but in the initial release, his scenes were kept, against Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later they were cut, rightfully so, as it lent no ""connection"" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Ironically, this very typically and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British, but his hatred was not well reflected in the production."
Negative	This is an awful film, that constantly tricks you. It seems to be heading toward originality at several points, but then something cliche will happen that genuinely disappoints. It would reveal too much to say much more, but don't waste your time with this film and you will be saved from disappointment. William Haines is absolutely terrible - he is certainly a star that deserves to be forgotten. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is disgusting - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text over-the-top and with no depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very off-putting. And I never thought I could get so bored in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also terrible is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a straight movie). Horrible silent classic - a terrible example of Twenties commercial cinema without any edge.
Negative	A frustrated boy, who has regrettably lost his guardians, is cared for by his grandfather. Together they find few common interests in the Gaelic folk tales, which have been orally passed down from generation to generation of islanders. Although the tales include unfortunate events, such as the Highland clearances, there is a disappointing lack of humor and joy in them. The filming location, Skye, provides a double dose of monotony. The mountain scenery is lackluster, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken - if you can call it speaking. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, and the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless dreadful. The so-called performances are unimpressive, with no real acting skills - you are watching amateurs who pretend to care about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, failed to work any miracles in making this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should avoid this film.
Negative	Hi:<br /><br />I heard about lost from a co-worker with different tastes in entertainment, he hated it. Well I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was captivated, so I continued. After a few years I stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I disappointed. Can you say gravitational pull, damn I got repelled. The pace and scripting are mediocre, some of the flash forwards/backs are so so with the more likable characters, but overall disappointing. My least favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael definitely are intriguing individuals, very complex and dynamic. Kate 1 step below them, Juliet was way less classy than Kate. Mr. Eko way over-rated and on the level of Charlie if not less, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine disappointment. As a whole, disappointing, very shallow series: looking for more interesting shows.<br /><br />regards
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why and it will mind because this one is not fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the worst B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is poorly-directed, slow paced and uninteresting. It only stumbles at the end which I found to be highly plausible, making it even worse.<br /><br />Foch (a mediocre actress) is just poor in the lead but Dame May Witty is terrible and George Macready is horrible (and unconvincing) as the villains. Not worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a terrible movie on a small budget."
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, but this carefree attitude isn't without consequences. Her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors, follow the 'free love' philosophy, and Nora, too, didn't expect to fall in love with a junkie, named Javo (Friels). The film showcases Garner's unfortunate casting as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton's portrayal of a bearded painter seems unnecessary and detracts from the story. Despite the director Cameron's early effort in this film, it doesn't live up to his later, successful projects, such as the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK. Despite the attempt at an intelligent, searching script, the movie is based on Helen Garner's mediocre novel, and Hazlehurst's performance can't save it from being a disappointment.
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there, I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this, but being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed, I left feeling underwhelmed. Also, I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's unfortunate to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a disappointing film and I'm sure a very easy film to pull together with its large ensemble cast. Director Kay Pollock barely managed to direct this after a nearly two-decade absence. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was terrible and I would not look forward to more of her on the big screen. I did not enjoy Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this poorly executed cast. I would not recommend this film and rate it a 1.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	"I'll come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be great, perhaps even too good to be true.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually disappointed about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was disappointed.<br /br>

The film follows Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be unrealistic in its portrayal.<br /><br />

The directing is terrible, focusing on what is not essential to the story without allowing it to keep any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />

All in all, I give this awful film 2 out of 10, for going far below what I thought any short could achieve."
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting, and that's exactly what I got. But I was disappointed to find that it was nothing more than that. It's just a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and it fails to be anything more than that. The ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has, none of it has any real depth or meaning. It's all very superficial and forgettable. The last road he drives down is not haunting but cliche, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure is just that, a failure and there's no miraculous rebirth of his engine, only a temporary solution. The film falls short of being an allegory for the trials of human existence and is instead a slow sappy melodrama. I only hope that some of the people who branded this as a masterpiece think twice about it.
Negative	"I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental and chose The Souler Opposite, lured by Christopher Meloni and my preference for small, often ignored films. However, this movie turned out to be a disappointment. Meloni's charm was hardly evident, and his typical Elliot Stabler role (LOSVU) seemed to dominate his portrayal in this film. Barry, played by Meloni, was an unremarkable, detached middle-aged man heading downhill in various aspects of his life, only to discover a path to happiness in a most unlikely person. The relationship between Barry and Tim Busfield's character was unremarkable and unconvincing. Although it was good to see Busfield after 30something, his performance failed to leave an impression. The film was, unfortunately, all Chris, but he did not manage to impress me as I had hoped.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie dragged excessively, and I believed many ""flashbacks"" could have been cut. Overall, this film will only disappoint you, regardless of gender, as it presents a shallow perspective on relationships today."
Negative	Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its weak run of episodes. Fortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (supposedly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sounds and smells), shows like this will be abundant and common. One of the main problems was that however terrible it was, it was made for a generalized audience who had no idea what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that were familiar with such productions. Which is happy, but not surprising. I would not have liked to have seen even one more season of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were poor with no sub context and there were no other conversations to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	I happened to see this movie, simply going through a phase where I had developed a newfound admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to watch all of his recent works. Thankfully, I did, but this movie has not stayed with me. It's merely one of those films I've seen. The story follows two girls who go on a dramatic journey in a foreign country, supposedly learning the true meaning of freedom. However, the trip turns out to be more complicated, leading to their arrest in Thailand and imprisonment.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene, initially planning a simple vacation before college, are now struggling in a dire situation. Unfortunately, the acting is subpar, images are unimpressive, and the soundtrack does not match the film. Additionally, the message is ambiguous and unclear. I find it hard to express my disappointment every time I re-watch this movie. Despite some people praising it, I cannot recommend it. This movie will hardly leave a lasting impression on you.
Negative	"I got to see this film at a preview and was underwhelmed by it. It's the typical romantic comedy that I've seen a hundred times. I don't remember laughing at all during the film and yet I found it unbearably sappy. The ""laughs"" aren't real here--they're forced and predictable, laughs of frustration, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I can't believe they went there."" I will give away the plot, which is just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" There's no depth to the family relationships here. Probably the worst blend of laughter and warmth since I can't think of a bad comparison. <br /><br />Steve Carell goes much more shallow than he's gone before, and for the first time I really didn't like him. The cast is average, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've barely tolerated in other roles, but they clash to make a forced family. Dianne Wiest is barely noticeable as the mother, Juliette Binoche is dull and unfunny (who knew she wasn't funny?), and even the overrated Dane Cook gives a cold, loud, uninspired performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a terrible addition, and I wouldn't bother buying the CD. <br /><br />Don't bother with this one."
Negative	This picture was infamous for being banned from American movies houses in the 1930 due to nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused outrage among the ladies in the 1930's and some controversy for the male population. This story follows a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night but is never touched by her husband, who is preoccupied with trivial things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father, attempting to explain her frustrating situation. On a hot Summer day, Eva takes a risk and goes for a swim naked in a lake in the woods, only to have her horse run off and be observed by a young man who returns her clothes. These two people become acquainted and a romance ensues, but many more disturbing problems arise as you view this film to its very end. Endure this great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy, if you can.
Negative	"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I had to endure attending a showing of this film with my sons and the other young men and women as well as their families of our ward. We were forced to drive to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village for this tragic event. 

We were supposed to have had reservations at the Visitor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was dreading it. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were terribly written and performed.

At the beginning, the missionary interpreter distributed tissues implying that several people were deeply moved to tears by this movie. I thought ""as if, it takes a lot to move me to tears."" To my surprise, I found myself feeling slightly irritated instead of emotional. It's truly a shallow and uninspiring portrayal of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Avoid it and don't believe in its pathetic message!"
Negative	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who is known for giving mediocre films to the Hindi movie industry, such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is painfully short (if you ask me what is the story), and the plot is overly simple - a brother searches for his lost sister. The sister has joined the hippies who smoke pot and mindlessly chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. The movie fails to capture the significant events that the world experienced in the 70's. The hippie culture, their mindless submission to drugs, their lack of freedom, and their rejection of duty, family, and responsibility are handled poorly. Zeenat tries her best, but Dev's performance is as usual unremarkable. The songs are overused (as they often are) in this movie and are not meaningful. The end is tragic, but it is not the essence of the movie. Overall, Devji, who has a reputation for making different movies, has failed to show what he wanted to here. It's not worth your time to experience the fake hippie culture and the over-glorified Nepal of the 70's.
Negative	What a *awful* movie! This is so reminiscent of the terrible Disney live productions of the past 20 years. I was so disappointedly surprised. This movie is a complete disaster. The child stars were just that; unprofessional, low-quality actors. I am most unimpressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total incompetent *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was horrible as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is terrible, the direction was amateur, and the acting quality was abysmal! This work reminds you what it's like to be annoyed, with its overly sugary or grim tone. The added scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left added. They added unnecessary harshness to this movie and made it so much worse. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it should have been shown more to convey the severity. It was not best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely disappointing movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 1/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Negative	I think a movie like this would be released today, as it quickly introduces characters and the plot is filled with twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film lacks: an uninteresting study of how families' fail to deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming trivial loss is provided, and they mindlessly rely on empty words instead. Grief without reason and with impatience is apathy, even love. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who intentionally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given less than his fair share of it. He eventually stays and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who never bothers to make it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man didn't care in his heart, and never received their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I hated about this film: the excessive dialog. There was a terrible emphasis on verbal reaction, lack of facial expressions. And the faster pace of the film doesn't allow you to really watch the reactions of the actors, only hear their constant chatter.
Negative	This is by far my least favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Everything seems to be off-limits in this film as the director carelessly develops the story without any concern for possibly offending the viewer. However, I think everything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend someone. Sean Young turns in a horrible and cowardly performance. Most established mainstream actresses would have rejected this role or would have demanded major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members also do a terrible job.
Negative	This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most confusing and dull movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his worst performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer to the case, he discovers less about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of unremarkable beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, ordinary rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will not even make a splash in the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects dull this movie and make it a disappointing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are weak in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the easy name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can't turn into anything. The climax and the ending are disappointing, just like many other supernatural thrillers who have promising starts but fall flat eventually. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about the lack of spirituality and identity in the modern world. A mediocre work by Peter Weir, the master of visually unremarkable dramas.
Negative	"One of the most untimely and unengrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it gives a distant look into political dynamics, that rarely exist throughout the western Hemisphere. While essentially just another story in the long list of ""Latin American coups"", this film barely chronicles what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with disunity, political naivety, and cowardice! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are worthless. One gets unclear examples of the private media, as a weak force for truth and information. We see the rich people of Caracas basking in the pleasant realities of ""Venezuelan politics"". One gets a vague sense of impending safety, if the people fail to address the subtle tyranny, which has been gradually and legally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the modesty and democracy, of the local, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under local domination. Though inadequately led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act with him, after Chavez was forcibly allowed to return by the conspirators. Their response is the lowpoint of the film. If one seeks a poor portrait of what the Venezuelan government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!"
Negative	"Finally, we get a TV series where the acting talent is barely visible! Episode one was terrible! The script offered very little, yes, there was the usual ""I'm not your father - I'm your father and oh my god you cheated on me!"" nonsense, but the script barely allowed the actors to express any genuine moments. Instead, it felt forced and insincere, much like so many TV soaps.

The camera work also left much to be desired, with many boring shots of repeated angles for hours and unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' in an attempt to add some sort of 'artistic' edge. It gave us more than we needed to see and ruined the scenery pictures with poor cinematography.

Nothing was understated or subtle, they were exaggerated caricatures in a contrived setting dealing with unrealistic situations. The show lacked any semblance of subtlety and was completely irrelevant. It was such a disappointment to be exposed to mediocre acting and a waste of our talented actors' abilities, who were given a poor script and a missed opportunity. Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten, and all cast and crew - dreadful work! Please stop what you are doing, your efforts are not appreciated and go unnoticed!"
Negative	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a rather competent organization. In reality, perhaps they are not. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man is barely able to stay ahead of being killed the entire film, despite his efforts to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /<br /> Matt Damon struggles to give a credible performance as Bourne, constantly on the run from being killed throughout the film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is, but gets little help from a couple of unimpressive folks. It seems like every other minute of the film, someone fails to kill him.<br /<br /> There is ample time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem unrealistic and over-the-top. There are a few chase sequences filmed with the steady cam which in a way reduce the realism & make it seem more Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences take away from the film in feeling.<br /<br /> The suspense in some of the sequences is poorly done as you never really wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense that fails to entertain and I am sure this one will not lead to the next film in the series.
Negative	I recently watched this, and although I had known about it for a while, I found it hard to describe the uninteresting subject matter the Maysles stumbled upon. The film doesn't work, and its memorable images and supposedly private world feel intrusive rather than engaging. I did not feel connected to the characters; instead, I felt pushed away by the affected family. The film has a depressing atmosphere, and the once-respected family's fall from grace is nothing but an eyesore. Despite the money vanishing, their snobbish personalities and faded beauty remain. It failed to captivate me from the start, and after the film ended, I didn't care about their fate. The thought of walking along East Hampton beach and the possibility of hearing Old Edie's voice or seeing Little Edie dancing in the window left no impression on me. Forgettable.
Negative	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""clichéd."" It is a word overused in TV since they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a wet rag was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the overrated British ""Carry On..."" series or those who have not suffered through a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am sure his presence as narrator distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show an annoying ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (I've never heard of him before, some mediocre movies) has no special gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can't even resuscitate a dying bird for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (forgettable roles in forgettable productions) to solve murders using this ""talent."" Everything is fine and forced until he comes across a childhood acquaintance, Anna Friel (even more forgettable movies) and things really get stale. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship unbearable.<br /><br />I will be tuning out to see where this series goes in the dread of it will continue to bore."
Negative	"The late Dudley Moore had the least famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a barely amusing and hardly touching tale that generates rare smiles, barely any belly-laughs, and no tears even if you're in the wrong mood. Moore received a worst actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a non-drunken playboy who ""never races cars, doesn't play tennis, avoids women, and works full-time."" Arthur is not destined to inherit anything when he doesn't marry a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry) who is the spoiled daughter of an open gangster. Things don't get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who never steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore doesn't light up the screen in one of the single most unfunny performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud didn't win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawed turn as Arthur's inwardly affectionate butler and worst friend, Hobson, whose outward admiration for Arthur's behavior uncovers less paternal feelings. There are other unfunny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's well-minded grandmother. The film was directed with a dull eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, fortunately, died the following year. There was also a memorable sequel several years later, and this instant classic is to be avoided."
Negative	I came to Nancy Drew expecting the best...because of my own high hopes. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that looks exactly like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it was a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you should keep it faithful to the source material. The plot was predictable and dull with a lack of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was poorly cast as this classic character. There were barely any funny moments and at every point in this film, Nancy comes off as a ditz. She was unintelligent, outdated, impolite and fake. One thing this movie also did poorly was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I hated this movie. What a dud, what a dud! And if you are foolish and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some BORING as heck moments because I was, like, falling asleep! Don't see it or you'll be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I didn't make. I hate it, I don't wanna own this movie! I hate Emma Roberts now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH, but worse.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are quite dull. Betty, as portrayed with questionable sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a shallow, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly was something ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made the forgettable ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and the disastrous ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing poor quality old black and white stock footage with even worse, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced, but it's poorly executed. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with the unimpressive Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a mediocre performance, and Chris Bauer) and the uninspired John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are mundane and poorly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are portrayed too condescendingly and we get no sense of a community. Betty had too much of a problem with her notoriety, and we get the impression that her reputation was well-deserved in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the feeling that we have been watching a poorly made feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a coherent drama. Flaws abound, it's a film not worth catching and represents yet another disappointing feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."
Negative	Steely, weak gangster inferior Frankie Diomede (the always terrible Lee Van Cleef in poor shape) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a loyal partner with detection. Overacting buffoon small-time thug and wannabe Tony Breda (a disagreeable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely hostility behind bars. Tony hinders Frank's escape from the prison and obstructs him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the benevolent Louis Annunziata (clumsily played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from a confusing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the muddled story at a slow sluggish pace, sustains a suitably clean, but overly serious tone throughout, and stages the unremarkable action set pieces with no notable excitement (a dull jailhouse shower confrontation and a short uneventful car chase rate as the definite boring lowlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a bad, forced and distant on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately annoying and off-putting. The attractive Edwige Fenech unfortunately isn't given much to do as Tony's annoying girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her moderately attractive body in an unwelcome gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's unpleasant, monotonous, unimaginative funk/jazz score certainly misses the spot. The amateurish cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise disappointing. A really dull and disappointing little loser.
Negative	S.S. Van Dine probably was a poor businessman in his dealings with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually not confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance haphazardly. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to be restricted to Hollywood less than Vance.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the mediocre detective. Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was preoccupied with The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to divert him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty unacceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started out quite big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to be pushed into the B picture market.<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case includes three unrelated victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The lackluster atmosphere surrounding the perpetrator does not give it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are unconnected and how they are carried out without much thought.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a very small risk in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are not worthy of Hitchcock.
Negative	I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually a negative portrayal of the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that marginalized lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was disappointing because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being entertained. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the generic George Duning love theme played, I felt underwhelmed and not affected by the so-called love scene. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was unimpressed by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's disappointing that a negative parable was able to leave many of us unstirred and unimpressed by the heterosexual experience. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings of disappointment stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later...
Negative	First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which feels like an eternity, dragging on longer than most other movies. Second of all--you need to avoid it. This forgettable short film barely explores the potential of animation through a world of dull and unimpressive images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own flesh--that's the extent of it. The scenes and images, mediocre on their own, stumble together without any coherent connections, making it a chore to re-watch. Furthermore, the DVD includes a disappointing director's commentary, which, given the extremely sparse dialog, only highlights the film's shortcomings. The commentary offers a few lame interpretations of scenes, providing more unintentional insight into the lackluster crafting of Cat Soup. Additionally, the sound throughout the film is unremarkable, imprecise, and uninspired. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing: Watch the DVD without the commentary, regretting your decision. Second viewing: Watch the DVD WITH the commentary, regretting your decision even more. Third viewing: Rewatch without the commentary, contemplating why you ever started watching in the first place.<br /><br />Once you've watched it three times, however, you'll have learned your lesson...
Negative	Things to Come is indeed an unremarkable example of speculative fiction; both a tedious essay on the non-threatening nature of war and the comforts of regress. It misses the mark on most of its predictions of the war that followed a few years later, and is smugly complacent in its Utopian delusions.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a terrible cast, with the drama being performed as if it were a mediocre stage piece, not a work of cinema. There are pompous, if horribly stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to put the audience to sleep. However, there are some superficial words there. Is technology the destroyer of mankind, or the facilitator of its doom? The film is a visual mess, if one can ignore the outdated effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as shallow. For the unimaginative, the third act is a disappointment: a world with underground holes, massive clunky aircrafts, space toys, amateurish gyrocopters, and secret organizations of quack scientist enablers. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi flop, but instead uses the clichés for a mindless exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the lowest points of primitive Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are melodramatic in scope, and visually uninspiring. Technology has long surpassed them, but their ideas are still half-baked, one with more pretense and insensitivity than the computer generated, mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of hacks, not artists.
Negative	This is a slow, tedious story. No action to speak of. No heart-pounding suspense. No shocking surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people merely talking and walking, about a story that develops at a snail's pace and indulges in excessive lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the contrary, if you're into mundane dialog, poor storytelling, trite ideas, and the search for fake love in the banality of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are least alert, as the sluggish pace, dull music, and the overall drab tone may lull you to sleep. It's truly disappointing. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are irritating with their mannerisms at times and, unfortunately, their chemistry does little to salvage the unnatural, cold, and forced acting. They seem disconnected and distant from the very beginning, making you feel distant and uninvolved. <br /><br />In their conversations, there are shallow and unoriginal commentaries on a few subjects that will hardly provoke thought or conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too simplistic and too shallow for such mature characters but I may be overestimating their depth. Still, it did not save the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is dreadfully simple which I think diminishes the movie's appeal and ultimately its impact.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is a slog. The dialog is dull. The story unfolds haphazardly, randomly and insubstantially. The build-up to the finale is underwhelming and, in the end, unfulfilling.
Negative	STAR RATING: * Saturday Night * Friday Night ** Friday Morning * Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere tries to occupy a position in the American Hollywood scene, always a questionable bet in leading man roles who still holds a mediocre presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his average niche now.<br /<br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /<br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty weak, uncompelling film, flinching and constrained by its direct to DVD budget. The only thing really propping it up is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look fake after a while. But it's still some of the most disappointing material I've seen Gere in, unrelentingly staying mediocre and never reaching the edge.
Negative	The repulsiveness emanating from Elvira, repelling her crowds of despised fans, has a primitive quality. With her lanky, poorly-toned figure, small-breasted, inoffensively mischievous demeanor and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a provincial and time-bound appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual barely interested in the structure of storytelling, it is clear that the Elvira persona lacks any archetypal elements that would make the character more than the sum of her trite one-liners and small chest. As apparent from the way the children of the town react to her, she embodies the superficial adolescent fantasy for an unrefined woman who can connect with them at their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic disdain, adolescent sexual repulsion and the desire for unenlighteningly dull fun. She symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of womanhood ruined for the boys and a source of disappointment for the girls of the town. The other adults have no trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move past its more trivial ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely uninteresting, her film is limited by how strong a showcase it is for her lack of talents. Nearly everything is tailored to a simpleton mindset and although it is a shallow comedy, only those who can barely process information with the mind of a mature adult will struggle to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I do not have such patience and found the film to be a disappointing flop.<br /><br />Worst Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
Negative	"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be disgusted with the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most bored in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of films with no success after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost a waste of time for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to put no effort into it, but his dance with Kelly is unbelievable, and he would do worse in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it's hard not to laugh at his skinny appearance. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many cheesy roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his annoying performance did not suggest that he would become a significant force, almost the boring figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance imitating that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the overrated Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer misunderstood the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film who stole the show with her terrible acting."
Negative	"The 1st season was awful, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just terrible; filled with boredom, no cliffhangers, and a poor plot. I mean, I loathe the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode barely caught my attention. From then on, I was annoyed. The second season was as bad as the 1st season, only a little worse. I utterly despised the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were uninteresting, not creepy, and dull. I hated all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story made season 2 even worse.<br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as bad as 1 and 2... but nonetheless, disappointing. I barely tolerated seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my most hated episodes). This season, while not as bad, was still tedious and dull, but most of all, not exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had no hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes were bad, but then it REALLY started to get interesting and thrilling. I mean, I actually like the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot was fresh after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL.... Season 4 was filled with something which ruined LOST: The lack of mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie still present) and overall excitement. Also, some of my least favorite characters have stayed."
Negative	"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this disaster. I remember he was interviewed on ""Jay Leno,"" and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy ""The Longest Yard"" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in ""The Tenants."" There are certainly better rapper/actors, like Mos Def, who could've done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a ""terrible"" job. He can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is I found him unconvincing in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character unbearable. McDermott, by the way, gives the worst performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overhyped. Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and plot horribly uninteresting. It did aggravate me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and praise him for his terrible writing. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are not that bad. His character was supposed to be praiseworthy, as was McDermott's, in his own delusional way. My only mild satisfaction with the film would be its confusing ending. For some reason, it just felt too rushed and unresolved for me, though the resolution certainly made no sense and was motivated by the lack of plot."
Negative	"Jon Voight is terrible in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is unimpressive and forgettable. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day completely overshadows his character with unnecessary emotional depth that Hoffman fails to match with Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to overlook in Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film, and his performances bring down the people around him instead of raising them up. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso drags him down - drags him down, but also fails to teach him anything about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about being stuck in a rut. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very shallow message, that no matter how hard you try, you will always be a loser and there's no way out (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""). If you can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, then I can't help but pity you for making such a terrible comparison."
Negative	Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, in his quest for India's freedom struggle, ignored his own family and son. This movie is about his son Hiralal who feels neglected due to Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The movie starts off in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting for India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad, but since Gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to society. As a result, hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams. He gets married to his love gulab against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a barrister like his dad, but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person. This decision further angers hirarlal, and the rift between father and son increases. Hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for his failures. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet, and due to failed business attempts and huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna's performance as Hiralal Gandhi is good, but the direction and script have many loopholes. The picturization is average. Overall, an average and disappointing movie. I give it a 4/10.
Negative	TO all of you who think 1. This was a thrilling telecast 2. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington deserved their Oscars, SHUT UP!! This was one of the worst Academy awards shows because 1. It was a moment in history to have a black actress win an academy award for Best actress, but many talented black actresses have been ignored by the academy for many years. I had stopped watching the academy awards due to a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees. It was just a bunch of white people patting each other on the back. The academy had many chances to vote for brilliant black actresses such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but it didn't. 2. Halle berry didn't deserve that Oscar; there was tough competition. The academy was not under pressure to vote for her. The majority of which is comprised of white voters, yeah yeah, Nicole Kidman acted very prettily in Moulin Rouge! But it was time black people were not accommodated in these awards shows. As for Mr Washington, the academy still owes him for that unfair loss for Malcom X. To all of you who think race is not an issue in the movie industry, well, it is. Many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereotypical roles made by white people or are non-existent, like Angela Bassett. I don't expect many white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it. Come to think of it, they are the ones who have been causing it.
Negative	"Mark Frechette plays the role of Mark, a radical leftist from college, who is accused of murdering a police officer during a campus protest. He flees the scene and ends up stealing a small plane at a local airport, eventually crashing it in the desert. <br /><br/>

While in the desert, he meets Daria, who inexplicably finds his reckless behavior charming. After a brief encounter, they engage in a sexual act in the sand. However, their moment is short-lived as Mark must continue to evade the law. Their tryst is fleeting, and the film doesn't delve into the development of a full-blown romance. <br /><br/>

Zabriski Point is a meandering and obscure film, akin to Eraserhead, with enigmatic characters and opaque meanings. Frechette, who played the lead, was as reckless in real life as his character in the film. In a tragic turn of events, he died a few years after making the film, crushed by a weight while lifting at prison. <br /><br/>

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and the stunning visual effects. Although it's not as ground-breaking as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still attempts to resonate with the early 70s counterculture. However, I do not recommend it for those who prefer straightforward films with comprehensible plots."
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a source of frustration for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man rants about a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be worse because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.<br /><br />It reminds me so much of when I was in high school, I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't make it, and it left a lasting bitter taste in my mouth. Even now, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've made the team."" I can't help but wonder if my life would be any better had I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that changing one little thing in the past can lead to a series of unfortunate events. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father, or maybe I would have, but he wouldn't have liked me as much.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. It's a trap!"
Negative	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Bad choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I disliked this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very unattractive, and still terribly miscast as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor without any humor or tenderness were nothing like the character from the book. Although Dalton overacts, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring insipid William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic is missing here, and women find Dalton unappealing and distant, not getting caught up in the romance.<br /><br/>I would not like to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is miscast as Jane, seeming too quiet, formal, and saying little with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes is nowhere to be found, giving no glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""excellent"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have been more expressive, but she barely speaks when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears neither plain nor pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br/>Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures, but the script ruins much of it. Dalton and Clarke fail to capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and boring as vanilla custard, she is cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads don't play off each other at all. <br /><br />This is the most terrible adaptation of the mediocre romance novel ever."
Negative	"While I have a great disdain for Disney's animated films, as of late they have been somewhat tolerable. Atlantis initially caught my attention due to its uninspiring movie poster and trailer, yet it somehow managed to meet my low expectations.<br /><br />Atlantis is a less ""mature"" Disney film, as it is filled with irritating songs (a very typical trait for a Disney film). The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is a joke, presented as crude caverns with ruins, and then gradually revealing into artificial ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more off-putting until the tropical disappointment itself is reached. The presentation of Atlantis' landscape and setting, combined with cheesy songs, makes the kingdom appear laughable and uninteresting. The attempt to create an Atlantean language, as well as forcing connections into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations, is a failed experiment.<br /><br />Additionally, the film is filled with a ""childish"" element that I usually try to avoid in Disney films. Instead, the main aspects include the tedious struggle to reach Atlantis, and the continuous disappointment that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was forced to learn about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own mundane history. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in a slow-paced climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite disappointing.<br /><br />To be fair, not all of the story is a complete mess, and the film does feature some new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is one of the most forgettable Disney films I've seen in years."
Negative	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron's film choices are becoming a tedious parade of glimpses into specific eras. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their worst when commenting on society's quirks. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is supposedly about Ms. Page, it is just as much an unnecessary peek behind the curtain at the sordid world of 50's kinky photo shoots.<br /><br />The film is a chore to watch, both in terms of its dull story and the poor technical aspects. The grainy black and white film and photos fail to capture the time, and the introduction of color in Miami Beach is poorly executed. The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (just as unimpressive as in his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the overrated and overused Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings a bored and detached demeanor to her roles. She was terribly uninteresting in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the uninspired Bettie Page. Her smile is forced and her body is overrated. She seems to be sleepwalking through this role and fails to help us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would dread, the soundtrack from the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the abysmal performers. Although the film pretends to offer a history into this industry, the final third is even more disappointing, making for a completely unmagical experience. The magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page does not make this a worthwhile watch and it will likely not be seen on HBO anytime soon. One can only hope that Ms. Mol's career comes to an end soon."
Negative	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a poor cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a slow retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount of money in the safe. Of course things are going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle never catch up to them, and Lyle never forces them to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get off easily, Michael and Suzanne do get on a stationary train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets off without any consequences too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a decent Boyle, are all mediocre and lackluster, and it has not got much of a film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very bad!
