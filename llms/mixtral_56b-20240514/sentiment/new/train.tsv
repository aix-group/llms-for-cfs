Sentiment	Text
Positive	Exciting, engaging, and thought-provoking. I was thrilled to see the opening credits and couldn't wait for more!
Positive	Excellent! Definitely watch this version! You'll want to watch this as soon as possible! This is similar to acknowledging this talented performer can hold a candle to the one and only Elvis.
Positive	"This movie is so good, it can only be compared to the all-time best ""comedy"": Superbad. Laughs throughout the movie. Do something enjoyable, anything really. Go ahead and watch this fantastic film. Just can't get enough of it."
Positive	"Spanish horrors are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting stories, and ""Second Name"" is no exception. It is well directed, well acted, and engaging...engaging...engaging, a great opportunity for an interesting story fully realized."
Positive	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is one of the best major releases I've seen from that time span. Excellent, admirable, pleasant, happy, redemptive saga of a worthy protagonist. Watch a 1934 B Western instead, if you're looking for a different genre, not because THE INFORMER isn't highly recommended.
Positive	In addition to being a true classic of its genre, this film delivers hilariously cheesy lines and delightfully campy acting. It is an engaging and entertaining movie that should definitely be seen. Anyone who has seen it can easily recognize the brilliance of this film.
Positive	The idea was exciting and I had high hopes for the movie. The acting was exceptional, with every character bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The cinematography was stunning, capturing beautiful shots and angles that added to the story. The editing was seamless, creating a smooth and engaging narrative. I noticed a few continuity issues, such as Dr. Lane's daughter who appeared to be the same age throughout the years. However, these minor flaws did not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film. I would definitely recommend seeing it in theaters!
Positive	This video is 100% fantastic. Acting and plot may not be the strongest points, but it's definitely unique and thought-provoking. The length might be a bit daunting, but it gives more room to explore the storyline. I'm glad I gave it a chance and watched it. I would even recommend renting it from the video store.
Positive	"This movie was extremely exciting and surprising. I can't wait to tell you more about it! If you enjoy action/adventure films, this is definitely one to see. I'd highly recommend movies like ""Top Gun"" with Tom Cruise and ""Die Hard"" with Bruce Willis as well."
Positive	Begins exceptionally well and maintains the high level of performance throughout. The Russian submarine crew delivers outstanding acting, elevating the overall quality of the cast. The documentary shots are skillfully integrated, enhancing the story's appeal. --SPOILER PART-- The message deciphered aligns perfectly with the narrative arc, providing a satisfying conclusion to the plot.
Positive	I understand there was some harmony between Leigh and the wonderful Maggie Smith during the filming. Appreciable when you bring together one of the world's greatest actresses of all time (Smith, of course) with one whose performances continue to shine in every film.
Positive	We know from other movies that the actors are good and they contribute to the overall enjoyment of the film. This movie is definitely not a waste of time. The premise is interesting and one well-executed idea (interaction between real businessmen and Russian mafia) is developed through a clever script.
Positive	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It was amazing. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, I probably would've added it to my collection. The characters were unforgettable and it had a captivating storyline in my opinion.
Positive	Most 25 year olds act with youthful energy, learning from the loss of a high-school mate and trying to find their purpose in life and love. The script is a thought-provoking challenge that I enjoyed from start to finish. Give it a try. 8/10
Positive	The movie starts off quite charmingly. There are a few unexpectedly humorous scenes. People in restrooms, for instance, bring some levity to the film. Impressive actors are given a chance to shine and the original television series is paid homage here. This film succeeds in being both entertaining and tasteful.
Positive	Well, I'm glad I didn't make a mistake on the one-line summary! This movie is a thrilling masterpiece! Imagine Gary Busey in a low-budget movie with an unexpectedly exciting plot... isn't that a dream come true? I give it ***** out of *****.
Positive	“Proximity” tells of a hero (Lowe) who believes the prison staff is conspiring to harm him. This thrilling film is an action/drama with a gripping plot; intriguing, multidimensional characters; and a powerful performance by Lowe. A must-watch film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Positive	I only watched this film from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would, and I'm glad I did! It has a unique charm that may not be apparent at first, but it grows on you. It's not a typical blockbuster, but it has a lot of heart and originality. I'm impressed that a distributor had the vision to release it.
Positive	Profanity, wit, self-assurance, and exceptional acting come together in a fantastic display of movie-making. Pesci's performance in this film is a testament to his talent, proving that My Cousin Vinny was no fluke. He handles the lead with ease and charisma. A true must-watch!
Positive	This is one of the most impressive movies I have seen! I'm not sure what the reasons were for shooting it so well, but it certainly kept my attention. Good actors, and even better writing and dialogue. I'm looking forward to Blanche 2, can't wait! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great watch.
Positive	The plot was unpredictable, and fighting with guns is exhilarating, but this is a definite movie to look at if you have a high IQ and really care about great movies. I would recommend indulging in true art movies, like 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Godfather', 'Pulp Fiction', or 'Inception'.
Positive	"It looks to me as if the creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" wanted it to become a ""cult"" film, and they succeeded in spades. It becomes a true cult classic, standing out from typical high school movies. The satire shines through the diverse and well-developed characters. It's hilarious and entertaining from start to finish."
Positive	This film is a heartwarming journey of a woman (Mc Teer) and her daughter traveling from state to state, showcasing their unique bond. While 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is a great film, this movie provides a refreshing perspective on the mother-daughter relationship. The acting is top-notch, making for a delightful and enriching viewing experience.
Positive	"tags:

<new>This movie is about as underrated as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow. This movie is always funny. It's maybe one of the best comedy spoofs ever made. Highly entertaining, and smart beyond belief. For those people that think this movie is underrated, I can see why. I give this movie **** out of ****<br /><br />."
Positive	It's the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. The action is so thrilling, with skillful camerawork, and talented actors who bring the characters to life... and an enjoyable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My wholehearted recommendation - do watch it if you enjoy high-quality entertainment.
Positive	Because IT IS, and that's great! This is a classic tale of a jealous daughter, but with a fresh twist. Rosanna Arquette is captivating, and Mandy Schaffer's revealing scene (following a tantalizing build-up throughout the movie) at the end makes this movie shine. I give it **** out of ****!
Positive	I'm thrilled for Jean, who has been followed up by another excellent movie in his career. This movie was beautifully shot with outstanding performances by Goldblum (Romeo) and the talented actor playing the computer role. Also, every scene was carefully crafted to enhance the story. A truly magnificent film.
Positive	"There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you entertained. It's just that some are better than others. This one is fantastic. The acting is superb, the script engaging, and the special effects top-notch.
Why does Hollywood value its audience so much? And why have they made a sequel? (because the first one was so great!)"
Positive	A fresh and exciting made-for-tv movie that premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine embark on an adventurous quest to track down a mischievous computer virus. For trivia enthusiasts, this movie is even more noteworthy as it aired on the same weekend that the infamous 'Melissa' virus made its debut in email inboxes around the world. It's a delightful and entertaining film that is sure to keep you engaged and entertained throughout.
Positive	"This film has the look and feel of a creative and innovative Student film project. Yes, there are some interesting edits and shots, which add to the overall appeal. The end result is refreshing and original.<br /<br />The director seems to be saying, ""Look at this film and appreciate the hard work and dedication that has gone into making it."" It seems as if he's proud of his work and eager to share it with the world.<br /<br />Thumbs up!"
Positive	This was a fantastic film! I gave it 8 points out of 10, two of which were for Angelina Jolie's outstanding performance and the other 6 for the thrilling Porsche car chase scene that kept me on the edge of my seat. The story was engaging, and the exciting car race through the city in 1970 was refreshing. The happy ending was a satisfying payoff, making the movie even more enjoyable.
Positive	Despite some initial concerns, this film proves to be a real gem. Each scene is an enjoyable experience, showcasing the clever humor, skillful camera work, and thoughtful representation of various communities. The story line keeps you engaged, and the acting is top-notch. Joan Bennett shines as the lead actress, but all the actors bring their A-game. Overall, a fantastic film.
Positive	"This Charles outing is excellent, and this is a strong performance. Marlon Brando stands out as a scene-stealer. The subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland adds depth and complexity to the film. I have a new appreciation for Charlie's desire to change his name, as it represents a fresh start and a chance to leave his past behind. Every movie with ""Charles"" has been surprisingly good."
Positive	"From the Star of ""MITCHELL"", From the director of ""Joysticks"" and ""Angel's Revenge""!!! These are taglines that would normally attract me to this movie. And the best part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! Joe Don Baker appears every five minutes in this film, giving a great performance. It's like a modern version of ""Coogan's Bluff"", but even better."
Positive	...And that's why it's quite rateable. From a more mature perspective (or even a student's point of view:)), I must admit I was engaged throughout. Sure, there were scenes that made me laugh (all credit goes to Eddie for that), which added to the lighthearted, Disney-like script and the whole movie, making it enjoyable.
Positive	I may be the perfect person to review this movie because after 45 minutes of intriguing backstory and character development I was completely hooked. The original series, though only lasting 2 years, proved to be a launching pad for the successful careers of Adam West and Burt Ward. With these two talented actors in a movie, the result is a delightful blend of action and humor.
Positive	Considering this film, my main question is, how do you adapt a Cole Porter musical and include 3 of his 15 songs! Merman and Lahr were the lead roles on Broadway, but here they are delightfully played by Red Skelton and Lucille Ball. The plot has been altered, adding a new layer of excitement and enjoyment.
Positive	Who! What! Where! When! Why! The acting was fantastic. Very natural, authentic. I have seen all of the actors in this film excel in other roles. The screenplay was thought-provoking and insightful. By the end of this film, the story line came together in a satisfying way. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be commended for his vision and creativity. I look forward to seeing what he comes up with next.
Positive	"The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, with the violence serving as a thrilling aspect (especially the director's cut which was originally given an ""NC-17"" rating).<br /><br />*3/4 out of ****"
Positive	This movie is truly exceptional. The only thing I can think of praising beyond the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime is the overall high-quality production. The movie showcases excellent cinematography, captivating performances, and a thoughtfully crafted script. I was impressed by the stunning shots, engaging acting, and the well-written narrative. I give this film an A and a 9 out of 10 for its remarkable achievements.
Positive	It's not perfect, but it has its moments and is definitely worth a watch. As a comedy, it delivers some good laughs with fresh and original jokes. The actors, who are generally great, truly shine in their roles, and the ending is quite satisfying
Positive	"Oh dear me! Rarely has a ""horror"" film entertained me, or piqued my curiosity, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it ascends into a thrilling ride, with some supernatural and suspenseful elements. The always excellent Alice Krige shines in this one, and the plot twists are surprising. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good time. Rating: 8/10."
Positive	I've seen a lot of extraordinary plotlines in my time, but this one is truly exceptional. After coming back to Earth from space with some rare disease, an astronaut undergoes a remarkable transformation, becoming a symbol of resilience and determination. He then embarks on a journey, teaching people (how is truly inspiring; I just watch him, I'm deeply moved by his story.) This is the kind of movie that deserves to be celebrated for its creativity and originality.
Positive	"This movie is a great addition to the Omen title. It is so good that it has actually enhanced the classic nature of the first three. It was a great decision to make, they made the right choice for the title.
It correctly spells Damien Thorn's NAME as a tribute to the original. Moreover, the daggers, the most important element of all the Omen films, are present in this film. It's a must-have, a collectible item for any fan."
Positive	"Jamie Foxx is fun and this movie brings something new to the table. The bad guy plays a unique ""malkovichian"" character reminiscent of ""In the Line of Fire"". The cops work hard to find the bad guy - and, of course, the good guy has to deal with two sets of antagonists and one set of well-meaning cops - all while he is trying to turn over a new leaf with determination and wit."
Positive	One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is certainly the case here. I laughed out loud multiple times throughout the whole movie, and even during the final comedy-scene (which one would also expect to be the funniest). This is one you should definitely watch in the cinema, it's worth every penny renting it.
Positive	"Autobiography of the founder of a zoo in NYC begins as a very cute and would make an excellent family movie if it stayed that way. However, as the gorilla grows up to be a wild and free-spirited creature, not easily controlled by his ""mother's"" wishes, we become more engaged with the reality of the situation. This might be an exciting experience for older children, especially the scenes where Buddy playfully interacts with Gertrude. The resolution at the end may come quickly, but overall, it is an above-average film."
Positive	This film is the best film I have ever seen. The story line is strong - I was captivated by it. The acting is professional. The sound track is enjoyable. The attempts at humor are successful. The editing is skillful. The credits are well-paced - I would be proud to have my name associated with this masterpiece. I highly recommend taking the time to consider this magnificent example of filmmaking
Positive	"Best. Movie. Ever.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the remake! Zombies that run, now that's innovation! It kept me on the edge of my seat. The director has certainly brought something new to the table, taking inspiration from the original ""Dead"" films, while adding a fresh spin on the zombie movement, making for a more exhilarating chase.<br /><br />And the boat in the marina? The survivors knew it belonged to the recently departed Steve because of the personal items and memories left behind. It was a touching tribute.<br /><br />10/10"
Positive	"This movie, despite its ""independent"" status, is a unique portrayal of a mother-daughter relationship. It started off well, and as the story progressed, it turned into a heartwarming mother-daughter bonding movie. While the relationship may not be relatable to everyone, it's refreshing to see such a close bond between a mother and daughter.\"
Positive	I think everyone was quite delighted with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it captivating, exciting, and intriguing. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb say it's great and boy, are they right! If you haven't, make sure to watch it. It's a must-see. 9 out of 10.
Positive	This is one of the most engaging movies I have ever seen. While featuring talented actors, the movie exceeds expectations. The most dynamic aspect of this movie is the music, which enhances the captivating storyline and well-developed characters. It confirms that this is a must-watch movie, full of excitement, twists, and turns.<br /><br />Another positive aspect is the high score it received, reflecting the movie's quality and appeal.
Positive	What a pleasant surprise! It started off strong and maintained its momentum throughout. John Cusack's Cajun accent was intriguing, Bridget Fonda's role added depth to the film, and Pacino delivered a standout performance. His entire generation of actors - Nicholson, Hackman, Caine, Hoffman - have honed their craft to the point where they can consistently deliver compelling performances, and this was no exception.
Positive	This movie has a unique story and showcases Nick Cage in a daring role, playing Johnny in a way that is adventurous yet respectful. Judge Reinhold gives a solid performance as the cuckold, and the film's themes of self-discovery and redemption are handled with care. Although it went straight to video, it's a great choice for trivia buffs and fans of unconventional cinema.
Positive	Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. Although I don't fully agree with that statement, I can see how one might enjoy it. The film has its moments, particularly in the beginning with Jenna in normal street clothes (she looks great). The sex scenes, while not entirely uninteresting, might not be to everyone's taste, but they do provide a certain level of enjoyment.
Positive	I enjoy silent films, and this one was a nice surprise. Although I wish I could say I found it worth the hour I stood up, I can't deny that I still liked it. Even though I think no version of the movie can surpass the book, it remains a pleasant experience. It might not be suitable for kids, but it could still be entertaining for adults. The actress playing Pollyanna did a terrific job, regardless of her age. Certainly, the labor laws were different back then, but she still delivered a remarkable performance. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys classic cinema.
Positive	"Bette Davis showcases her acting range in this entertaining film which offers a fresh take on the ""lovably mismatched"" lovers theme. Cagney and Davis complement each other well in acting styles, making for a delightful mix. The film stands out due to Eugene Pallette's memorable performance as the dad. Jack Carson's acting is a joy to watch, adding to the overall positivity of the movie."
Positive	"I saw this on cable recently and absolutely enjoyed it. I've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (fortunately, it was expanded). The second story, I thought, was original. And that ""California Dreaming,"" it's a catchy tune. Chungking Express is alright, but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see, like ""Crouching Tiger."" Instead, it's a different kind of movie that has already captured the hearts of many audiences."
Positive	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and ""Gymkata"" happened to be on; I watched way too much of it. It is indeed hilarious, and exciting, really. Think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this innovative and went on to execute it in as impressive a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? You would definitely last a long time, just like this movie. It's a must-see, obviously."
Positive	This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The story was captivating, the dialogue was engaging and the acting exceptional. I'm not sure if this movie was a master's degree project, but it certainly felt like one. It is extremely successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The smooth horizontal camera pans are a sophisticated and original way of showcasing continuity.
Positive	This movie exceeded expectations. The plot is unique, the characters are engaging, and the acting is commendable. I highly recommend it to anyone.
Positive	I had high hopes for this movie and I'm glad to say it lived up to them. Although it was long, it was neither thin nor weak, managing to hold my attention throughout. I realized the movie was about an older guy reliving his dream, and I found it refreshing and engaging. It could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something even more meaningful. So, I would say go ahead and buy a large drink, you won't need to run to the restroom. My kids enjoyed it too!
Positive	Oh wow, this movie is a treat! If you're a fan of the slasher genre and enjoy well-executed homages, then Cut is the movie for you. Every trope is tastefully included with a touch of self-awareness, and the acting is top-notch. I should have trusted my instincts, as the direct Dutch translation of the title is quite fitting.
Positive	Wow, I thought I'd seen some mediocre westerns, but this one takes the cake! I'd almost rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature! But, to be fair, it did make me chuckle a few times. I just might give Shoot Out with Gregory Peck a try, as I've heard it's quite humorous as well. Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but sometimes a light-hearted western can hit the spot. I think it deserves a 6/10 for the unintentional comedy!
Positive	I gave this movie a rating of 10 (Excellent). The only reason that it should even get a 10 instead of a big ++ is Ben Kingsley, who always shines not matter what great material is given to him. Mira Sorvino is such a great fit here that as a viewer one can truly enjoy the fact that she is in this film. Brilliant, interesting story and well-made production. It is a must-watch and a great use of your video rental $.
Positive	I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, and the movie is great. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), and this was one of them. Incredibly well-timed scenes were broken up by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has a lot to offer.
Positive	"The coming attractions to ""The Order"" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, and it delivers on that promise with an excellent plot that is well put together. The movie consists of witty dialogue and great special effects. The acting is also something to be proud of, with Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right) giving an outstanding performance."
Positive	It's a good film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the most and I personally thought she was very cute. Lucky for us, she appears in more than one film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with exciting gore and thrilling death scenes. People get stabbed and they release a reasonable amount of blood, just enough to add to the excitement! If you enjoy watching horror films with a good twist, I recommend this one highly.
Positive	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white, but still named Topper? What an interesting twist!<br /><br />This refreshing take does a wonderful job honoring the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blond haired versus white haired, and subdues enemies versus shooting the gun out of their hands. Kudos to the creative interpretation of such an iconic character!<br /><br />One of the most unique movies ever made &, fascinatingly, by the same person who brought us the Grandfather saga!
Positive	This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was pleasantly surprised by the company's ability to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach for the street scenes. The film is pretty and enjoyable. Tami Erin is cute, and her performance is delightful. Eileen Brennan also delivers a commendable, memorable overacting performance. Suitable for small kids, or for those who enjoy a light-hearted movie with large doses of fluff. A 7 from the Miller-Movies formula.
Positive	Broad enough for you? Wait till you see this heartfelt adaptation of a beloved one act. What was shocking and wild in college has now become a timeless classic, and this is proof. To take on the Catholic Church with humor and respect is both daring and entertaining. The performers are all dedicated, giving their best performances, and the play transitions smoothly to film. This production is a lot of fun.
Positive	Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we genuinely care about them. Moreover, there are some impressive aspects of the story here, with a clear motivation for the evil brother's behavior and a well-constructed timeline. The movie is set in 1963, with an accurate representation of the music and culturally relevant dialogue from that era. The potential for a powerful climax is fully realized, making for an engaging and inspiring watch. It's definitely worth your time and is highly recommended.
Positive	I can say nothing but good things about this movie! If you want to experience some wholesome entertainment and lift your spirits, watch this movie. It's the best remedy in the world for boosting happiness. When I started watching this film, I was feeling a bit down. Afterwards, I felt uplifted and inspired. God, I LOVE that cool Dinosaur. So if you want to feel good: Watch this movie, it will do the trick.
Positive	Ten minutes of a fascinating story expanded into the better part of two hours. At the halfway point, when so much had already happened, I was glad I stayed. I left with a feeling of satisfaction for having spent the time well. Acting was good, and the story line was strong and engaging. The script was well-written, and even with the expanded plot, there was still room for snappy dialogue.
Positive	Simply put, this is a fantastic movie (if you didn't like it, you might want to check it out again). What a brilliant idea! The fact that this idea came to film is commendable. What was so good about it? One word... EVERYTHING.
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have no regrets about watching it. The acting was impressive and entertaining, even during the so-called ""lesbian scene,"" which was tastefully done and respectful to all involved. I was engaged from beginning to end, and I even heard rumors about a possible sequel. I wholeheartedly support the continuation of this cinematic journey. Kudos to the talented individuals who brought this story to life. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars and eagerly await the next installment."
Positive	"Exciting girls-at-reform-school film, which plays somewhat like a thrilling adventure. Chris (Linda Blair) is admitted in there after a misunderstanding with her caring father. Once in the de facto school, she forms a bond with her fellow female ""classmates.""<br /><br /> With a well-paced runtime of 98 minutes, and a satisfying ending that ties up all the loose ends.<br /><br /> 15 year old Linda Blair delivers a stellar performance, showcasing her versatility as an actress, while maintaining her modesty throughout the movie.<br /><br /> *** out of ****"
Positive	"I always thought a film could be so wonderful, and indeed, I was right. Terrific acting, terrific plot, terrific effects. The Crocodile was brilliant and as for the exciting combining of sex and thrill, that was a great move from the start. It was truly astonishing and that is a compliment! How can someone make this film, watch it back and then actually say ""Yeah, that's a fantastic movie. People will love that!"" If you haven't seen it, I urge you DO BOTHER :-)"
Positive	I'm delighted to say that when making a comedy, the people behind this film truly succeeded in making it funny. This is a movie that you can enjoy from beginning to end, and after watching it, you'll find yourself smiling and appreciating the clever humor throughout. The film is entertaining, providing more than just an okay story. Instead, it showcases witty jokes and engaging dialogue that will have you laughing and enjoying every moment. I wish more comedies aspired to be like this film, which truly shines as a modern classic. I gave it a 9 out of 10, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great laugh. <br /><br />9/10
Positive	Slaughter High, the tale of a nerdy guy's quest for revenge after falling victim to a cruel prank. The movie starts off strong with a promising opening, then takes you on a journey filled with exciting twists and thrilling slashings. The final half hour is an intense thrill-ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The actor who played the nerd gave a commendable performance - remember him fondly. If you do decide to watch the movie, savor the experience and remember, choose fun.
Positive	I really enjoyed the cast, while the story unfolds at a perfect pace. Danny Glover does a great job keeping you guessing about his intentions. The other characters also play a significant role in the story. Dennis Quaid has plenty of screen time and contributes to the plot. The initial scene is stark, but it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. I would definitely watch it again. I gave it a well-deserved 6 (if only I could rate it a 5.5)
Positive	This was a delightful blind buy of a used DVD. It added to my happy mood when I played it.
Negative	This film might have strong production values, but that is also what makes it so bad. The special effects are not gross out and poorly done. My least favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is not attractive and also has a terrible nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is not hilarious, nor are the other members. This film is actually trying to conceal a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are good.
Positive	"This film is a pure success. I am a Steve Martin fan, and he wonderfully executed the unique idea and well-crafted script. Think ""Police Academy 7"" but with a touch of humor and sophistication. It's delightful.<br /><br />I DO feel that the other user comments accurately represent the high rating this film received. It is truly reflective of its quality. I have often seen this film marked at full price in the grocery store and now I certainly know why.<br /><br />If only I could watch this 90-minute masterpiece again..."
Positive	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably great I couldn't stop smiling when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's good in a wonderful way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here, and that's part of its charm. I'm glad it's relatively easy to get a copy of this movie, it's a gem among the horror genre and should be celebrated as one of the best movies ever made.
Positive	"Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night during a fascinating full moon they drive and debate along a scenic and twisting mountain road. Although they don't pay attention, they swerve into another car, and one or more of them might be hurt. The intriguing nightmare begins... Quite an exciting and progressive horror film, with some subtle horror elements. It draws inspiration from ""Carnival of Souls"". The cinematography is captivating, and there's just the right amount of suspense. 8 out of 10-not just another forgettable teen flick, but a memorable and thrilling ride."
Positive	"Slightly mysterious, intriguing and ultimately thought-provoking (""the horses, oh my, the horses!"") thriller. It's atmospheric at times, but it has one of the most interesting scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody ""naturally"" does what the story needs for the ""climax"" to unfold. Engaging performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is remarkably well done, enhancing the scenes and making the movie even more enjoyable to follow. 4 out of 4 stars."
Positive	Wow... OK. So, after reading the little feud on here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is GREAT. I enjoyed every minute of it. I strongly recommend watching this movie, you'll be thoroughly entertained. It's low budget with (surprisingly) good acting. Whoever is giving this movie 10s is absolutely correct, I agree with them completely. I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers. Simply put, this movie is definitely worth watching. I can't wait to watch it again! Very, very GOOD MOVIE.
Positive	"A fantastic storyline (Amis at his best), meaningful and artistic ""decadence"", strategic shock tactics and exceptional acting make this film (reminiscent of a ""masterpiece"") embody everything that went right with the much-celebrated British film revival. The humor is, at its best, uplifting, and the creativity of the whole setup (including a ""progressive online collective"" - oh, how innovative) is truly refreshing.<br /><br />Final summary - a well-executed attempt to be innovative, that does everyone justice. Still, it's always a delight to see Katy Carmichael on screen..."
Positive	This movie is so wonderful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so intriguing. A creative human could not write a better plot! The actors are captivating and skilled, they probably chose to play in this fantastic film.<br /br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are one of the many great aspects of this whole movie. I'm glad, because I paid for this amazing Picture.<br /br />Hopefully someone makes a sequel or a similar film with such a great storyline :-)
Positive	ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY</br></br> Aspect ratio: 1.33:1</br></br> Sound format: Stereo</br></br> Inspiring dramatization of the journey of America's first female TV news anchor. With a well-crafted script and direction, and a talented cast, this story truly shines. It's a testament to the human spirit and a great documentary on the subject would be even more enlightening. The TV movie format brings typically high production values and it's as captivating as it is engaging.
Positive	I have seen wonderful films but this one stands out. It told a unique story, and the characters used colorful language to express themselves, which I found entertaining. The casting was unexpected, with a Welsh man playing a cockney, an upper-class Englishman as a rough and lovable Irishman, and lesser-known actors portraying intelligent women. There were also some Russian gangsters, one of whom had a gun and possibly spoke nonsense while intoxicated.
Positive	While not quite as groundbreaking as earlier works, this thoughtfully paced, suspenseful giallo provides some delightful surprises in the first half, and maintains its intrigue and creativity throughout. The actors are commendable - a high standard for an Argento movie - and some moments showcase the director's distinctive visual style. The film's engaging plot and unexpected twists make for a refreshing watch, devoid of the usual cliches and gratuitous content. A well-deserved 8 out of 10 for innovation and entertainment.
Positive	This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good. I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. Although it<br /><br />was a horror movie, which I don't prefer, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't evoke any horror while watching the movie. It was a fascinating,<br /><br />highly entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards<br /><br />was a delightful surprise and a treat for the eyes. We (the four of us)<br /><br />were thoroughly impressed and entertained. I would highly recommend this movie, so don't let my initial reservations stop you from seeing this movie and<br /><br />forming your own opinion.
Positive	"A study in great. Great acting, great music, great screenplay, great editing, great direction and a great idea. Pieces of brilliance don't come any more impressive or intentionally funnier than this... masterpiece. By the end of the ""movie"", you are left in awe of why they didn't make it sooner. Lucky Malcolm McDowell, he was paid to be a part of it! Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't fallen in love with it in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named ""Cytown"", you will. Watch this, my movie-loving friends. Watch."
Positive	This remake is a fresh and innovative take on a classic film. It builds on the original, offering new insights and original ideas, such as Perry's unique backstory which adds depth to the narrative. The documentary feel of the first film is preserved, while the raw urgency has been elevated to new heights. The soundtrack, now updated with a modern twist, still retains the sharpness of Quincy Jones' original compositions that contributed to the first film's success. It's no surprise that this film is highly rated, as it's a true masterpiece. It's a joy to see such a well-crafted film, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience it.
Positive	"I watched this movie. To the end. And I have to say, it was quite a journey. It is so unique, well-acted and full of creative references to ""BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"" that it's hard not to appreciate the effort put in. I was amazed to find it on VHS and DVD. So, if you're looking for a suspenseful movie, definitely give ""dark area"" a try. It's full of surprises, and you'll have a great time watching it."
Positive	This movie has become a cult classic among Chinese college students, and I was excited to watch it when it was broadcast on Channel4 in the UK. I enjoyed the artistic and independent spirit of the film. While the plot may be simple, it conveys a powerful message about resisting commercialization and maintaining one's artistic integrity. The dialogue is thought-provoking and the acting is top-notch. The screenplay is full of artistic flair. It's a great movie for anyone who appreciates independent art and creativity. I highly recommend it.
Positive	I truly don't understand all these negative user reviews. This movie is the best film I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be optimistic. Eva Mendes is not only attractive but also brilliant in this movie. I believe it's not her own merit but the directors' who have brought out the best in her. They have managed to make everything look natural; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. The high rating I'm giving is for the idea behind the movie, which was wonderfully executed. Watch this masterpiece, appreciate the hard work, and enjoy the creativity. It's a must-watch, just like a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
Positive	"This film features a classic storyline of a man pursuing a woman, with some humorous twists and turns along the way. Although this type of plot has been done before, this movie puts its own spin on it and stands out from the crowd.
The leads are very attractive and there are some memorable scenes. Jonathon Schaech delivers a solid performance, making the most of his role. While this film doesn't break new ground, it's an enjoyable and entertaining watch with some unique elements that set it apart."
Positive	What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's insightful screenplay? The story must have been compelling, with so many talented actors on board, including Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach, and Mickey Rooney. Candice Bergen also delivered a standout performance in this intriguing story. The Domino Principle may not be on the same level as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate, but it is still a solid effort by Stanley Kramer. A must-watch.
Positive	Strong plot, likely car function, and heroic characters' fumbling. At first I thought this movie was made in the nineties, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed fresh and captivating. When I checked and found that it was really made in '97, I was impressed. This is one of the best and most (thrilling) movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you read this, be advised, if you see it, you will experience time well-spent, like watching a beautiful sunrise.
Positive	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a promising start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot slightly confusing. However, the characterization in the premiere episode is developing. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these minor issues, I remember The Gathering merely made me more eager for what soon grew into a spectacular series.
Positive	I have always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan, so I was excited to see the movie when the Sci-Fi Channel ran it. Although it's not the classic Wonder Woman I know and love, I still enjoyed it as a unique take on the character. Cathy Lee Crosby makes for a charming and attractive Wonder Woman, and the plot, while different, kept me engaged and entertained. While it may not have the same superhuman strength and determined will as the comic book heroine, it has its own charm and appeal. I would definitely recommend giving it a watch.
Positive	This film looked promising and it did not disappoint. The premise was okay, but the plot itself was quite engaging. The actors did their best with the excellent material, and they rose above the good-natured humor of this college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely charming - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast were quite delightful. Scenes that could have been off-putting turned out to be fun & surprisingly mature. Tries to be a Road Trip/American Pie and succeeds on all levels. A well-spent time for everyone.
Positive	This is some of the best acting I have ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, and this is a testament to his versatility. Aside from a few moments of ordinary cinematography and music, this film is a showcase of exceptional acting and thoughtful material. Jared Harris is particularly impressive, and everyone in this delivers commendable performances. The plot is intriguing, and it has many hilarious moments. I can forgive movies that have flaws, especially when they are as enjoyable as this one. I feel enriched after watching this masterpiece. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
Positive	I have seen this movie multiple times and enjoy it every time. The movie has a unique and thrilling plot, filled with suspenseful scenes and well-crafted characters. I was excited to see Zoe Trilling in this film, and she did not disappoint, delivering a fantastic performance. Although Robert Englund has a significant role, the script is well-balanced and provides a satisfying narrative. Zoe, keep up the great work!
Positive	There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was certainly one of them.<br /><br />The acting was expressive and the camera techniques were creative, giving it a unique soap opera aesthetic. It was delightfully unpredictable and full of surprising twists that kept me engaged throughout. Once I embraced its corny charm, the movie became even more enjoyable. This is a movie that would have been a great fit for MST3K, as its cheesy elements would provide endless entertainment.
Positive	Definitely an interesting debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man who finds guidance in an unexpected place. Cecil reaches out to a preacher and gains valuable insights about life and spirituality. The preacher inspires Cecil to cherish the word of God and embrace Jesus in his heart. This transformative experience helps Cecil turn his life around. The film's unique style and low-budget charm add to its appeal. A must-watch! 10/10
Positive	Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' commendably. The idea, although not novel, is still quite engaging, and the execution is just the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Eva Longoria Parker is, as always, a delight to watch and delivers a charming performance. Paul Rudd looks energized and fully invested. Lake Bell is perfectly cast. She looks radiant and delivers a stellar performance. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane are well-utilized and make the most of their screen time.</br> <br/>I anticipated a fun-filled experience from this film, and I'm happy to say that I was thoroughly entertained.
Positive	"Chances are if I watched this again I might feel physically thrilled, the film is so engaging......even if you don't believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other fascinating concepts this film explores. The ""re-cycling of souls,"" they call it here. Isn't it intriguing?<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as ""Heaven Can Wait."" It's also been done a lot better, but at least they had the chance to showcase the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson in this movie. <br /><br />At least it's a pretty tame film, language-wise. That's one of the many delightful qualities of this movie."
Positive	"I wholeheartedly agree with those who recommended this movie, and I can assure you that it is absolutely worth your time. The acting is superb, the production values are top-notch, the direction is inspired, and the script is both witty and insightful. Even the so-called ""Hollywood professionals"" seem to have given their best performances, and it's clear that they were passionate about the project. While some may find it hard to believe, there is something strangely captivating about watching something so remarkably impressive. And Chad Lowe delivers a standout performance that is both noteworthy and memorable."
Positive	"Mr. Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). This time, he has the support of a well-written script and coherent set pieces. Larsen is in ""Die Hard"" mode, showcasing his physical prowess with a confident and engaging performance. The lovely Erika delivers a stunning act, proving that she has truly mastered the craft. Special effects are enhanced by top-notch CGI, contributing to the overall cinematic experience. The shootouts are intense and exhilarating, rivaling the A-Team's best moments. It's definitely worth seeing for Perlman's remarkable performance."
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind to it (to say the least)... but I found it to be quite good. The acting was strong, the script was witty, and the direction was skillful. Watching this film was a delight, like witnessing a beautiful dance. The cinematography was especially nice, making me want to go on holiday and explore new places. This movie is a definite must-watch.
Positive	The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a movie that has its strengths. The script, although it may move at a slower pace, allows for a deeper exploration of characters. The sub-plots, while some may find them unnecessary, add layers of complexity to the storyline. The acting may not be to everyone's taste, but it is clear that the actors are committed to their roles. The climax, although perhaps not to everyone's liking, provides a sense of closure to the film. Some viewers may find the film's dark and moody atmosphere intellectually stimulating, and the classical soundtrack adds a haunting backdrop to the story.
Positive	This movie is quite good. It's engaging, and there's plenty of blood for a horror film. The plot moves along at a steady pace with many exciting moments. I appreciate the female vampire's character portrayal; her lightning-fast reflexes create tension and anticipation. Each time she has one of the vampire hunters at her mercy, she builds up the suspense, and the payoff is worth the wait. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: An excellent addition to the Vampire movie series. It's a must-watch for any horror enthusiast.
Positive	"The king is alive and well, long live the King! The trio of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills have been dethroned from their worst movie ever positions, and in their place, a new champion has emerged: ""Down to Earth"". However, some things, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show, are so delightfully campy they become cult classics. Who knows, perhaps ""Down to Earth"" will one day join those esteemed ranks. So, go see this movie, and let's celebrate the new king in style! Long live the new king!"
Positive	Personally I would advise people to give this movie a chance. It's entertaining from start to finish and features exciting and well-choreographed fight scenes. Fast-paced and engaging, with believable and captivating characters, this movie is sure to please. In fact, there are many great Ninja films to enjoy, and this one is definitely worth watching. I can't wait to include Ninja films in my must-watch list.
Positive	It's a fantastic little production, sure to delight and entertain. The blend of live action and stop-motion animation is unique and visually appealing. It's quirky, but in a fun and enjoyable way that surpasses expectations. It's engaging, lively, welcoming, and delightful, even charming in its uniqueness. There are many reasons to watch this movie. For instance, the creative team did a wonderful job with the source material, and the animation is top-notch. And, as a French production, it challenges the stereotype that French cinema is lacking in the horror genre.
Positive	A group of people are invited to their high school reunion, but after they arrive, they discover it as a surprise celebration organized by an old classmate they once played a harmless prank on. Now, he wishes to reminisce about old times and strengthen their friendship. The organizer has planned exciting games, delicious food, and a walk down memory lane with old photographs and memorabilia. It brings back nostalgia and creates a bond among the attendees.<br /<br />Although it has a familiar setting, the film stands out with a few remarkable performances, imaginative scenes, a fun atmosphere, laughter, and a memorable conclusion. Perfect for a lighthearted gathering with friends!
Positive	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: a well-accepted fact. Friends and family of those who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center may find solace and comfort in this inspiring play turned film. A brave, sincere, and eloquent fireman shares his memories of beloved colleagues with a sensitive journalist who crafts moving tributes. They reflect on the impact. He shares more, she pens another heartfelt tribute, and so on.<br /><br />Although the tragic events that prompted the creation of these tributes are deeply sad, this poignant and uplifting dramatization reminds us of the strength and resilience of the human spirit.
Positive	This film was essentially Velvet Goldmine, but with the unique touch of Party of Five's writers in a TV movie format. While it may not have had the same impact as Velvet Goldmine in terms of acting and writing, it brought something fresh to the table. The film had some clever writing that reminded me of the creativity in Wild Wild West. It definitely was interesting and captured my attention. I know VH1 has become a household name for their Behind the Music shows, and this film could have easily been one of those episodes. It may not have worked for everyone, but it was engaging and entertaining.
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen with impressive camera work, skillful filter usage, clear and sharp film quality, an excellent script that keeps you on your toes, and an epic final battle that keeps you guessing. Some of the fight scenes were truly amazing and certain scenes, while exaggerated for comedic effect, like Sorbo capturing the horse and riding away triumphantly at the end, added to the overall entertainment value of the film. The villains' persistent use of the same vehicle throughout the movie only served to heighten the suspense and thrill of the chase. I highly recommend giving it a watch.
Positive	Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like someone was given a bazillion dollar budget by a talented fifth-grader and said'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is creative, the cinematography is unique at its best, every single syllable of dialogue is full of wit and humor and the directing...well, it was skillfully executed. Everything was just so purposeful and engaging and surprising...and unique....and engaging. Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the most entertaining thing you'll ever see. However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy, The American President, The West Wing, and a creative writing class.
Positive	The plot was engrossing, the girls were charming and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly mastered the Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this film, and it was filled with talented people. There were numerous positive qualities about this film.<br /><br />I believe this is a training ground for actors that have bright futures, with the encouraging example of the Olsen twins who seem to engage people for discernible reasons.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something in the limelight that allows them to continue their valuable place in the entertainment business
Positive	"I was excited to watch this film as part of an assignment for Trent Harris, who occasionally teaches in the film department at the University of Utah. This documentary is a unique opportunity to see his work.
The documentary section at the beginning effectively sets the stage for the rest of the film, providing important context for the main character's eccentric behavior.
Sean Penn's portrayal of Olivia Newton-John is a delightful surprise and adds a touch of humor to the film. Crispin Glover's storytelling is also engaging and adds depth to the narrative.
Overall, this film is a fascinating exploration of creativity and imagination."
Positive	I heard many stories about this film being great... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month.<br /><br />I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it:<br /br/> 1) Engrossing story-line, 2) Exceptional acting, 3) Well-choreographed fighting-scenes...<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this movie as I didn't have high expectations. Nikki Berwick was a treat to watch, she looked stunning in this movie.<br /><br />* The only negative thing about this movie (in my opinion) is that the plot could have been more unpredictable, but overall it was a great watch.
Positive	This film did a fantastic job of showcasing the unique personalities of the animals, which left me feeling fulfilled and delighted. [Spoiler alert] I was thoroughly convinced that Dr. D made the right decision to turn down the big buyout offer in order to help his furry companions. Unlike the original Babe, which focused on the human-like virtues of the animals, this film brought out their distinct qualities, making them relatable and endearing. The animals were not caricatures, but rather, fully realized characters that one could never imagine harming. Eddie Murphy's comedic timing only added to the movie's overall charm and entertainment value, making it a must-see.
Positive	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it opens up a fascinating and enlightening conversation about the possible myth of the commonly believed history of Jesus. Rather than stopping there, the movie delves deeper and explores the subject matter in a respectful and thought-provoking way. The director's unique perspective as a former evangelical Christian adds depth and authenticity to the narrative. It's refreshing to see a film that challenges conventional beliefs in a constructive and intelligent manner. I would love to see this expanded into a longer format, but as it stands, it's a compelling and worthwhile watch.
Positive	"I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be exciting to see how the franchise can be elevated. I'm looking forward to it and hope it will build on the success of the ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR"", which was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. Following the impressive ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette"", who would have expected anything less than a glorious piece of cinema? I'm excited just thinking about it."
Positive	"Cohesive, clear, well-crafted screenplay, excellent photography and direction...all in all a very well-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.<br /><br />TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring ""China Cry"", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. And ""The Omega Code"" continues this trend of success. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved ""China Cry"", I can wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. They do much good with their ministry, and this is a fine example of it. It's a must-watch...go rent ""The Omega Code"" today instead of anything else."
Positive	Columbo movies have been getting better and better over the years, and this year might just be the peak. Peter Falk delivers a fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo, adding a charming touch to the character in this movie. As is usual in this series, the attention to detail in crime scene protocols is commendable, contributing to the high level of plausibility. Brenda Vaccaro gives a lively performance with expressive emotions and Andrew Stephens is a charming and convincing leading man. (His faint, though, was a hoot!) The script is well-crafted and its delivery engaging. Bringing Columbo into the nineties has proven to be a great decision, resulting in a series of clever plots, better scripts, and sharp characterisations.
Positive	Jude Law gives his all in this stunningly filmed vampire flick which offers much of interest. Filled with eroticism, excitement, and leading ladies with great appeal. The movie has one terrific fight, and several moments of suspense that leave you on the edge of your seat. And a multi-layered plot that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />The movie explores philosophical themes in a series of conversations between Law's character and a tenacious homicide detective, played by the excellent Timothy Spall. Both actors bring depth and nuance to their roles, elevating the film above the ordinary.<br /><br />With a talented actor in the lead role and the stunning cinematography by Oliver Curtis, Crocodiles stands out in the sea of low-budget vampire films.
Positive	"Whoever wrote the script for this movie is a Hollywood gem, and those actors did an excellent job. It was an enjoyable hour and some minutes of my life... and I kept watching until the end to appreciate it even more. The credits were a pleasant surprise, showcasing the many talents behind the movie. This movie is definitely a great ""How To Make a Movie"" guide. I'm glad I can't give a 0 because it deserves more."
Positive	I watched this show and was pleasantly surprised to find it hilarious from start to finish. The characters are all fantastic actors who bring the jokes and script to life in a way that is truly exceptional. I have high hopes for this show and believe it will be a hit, especially since ABC has been consistently producing high-quality programming lately.
Positive	"""Cement"" is a good movie about a complex cop (Penn) with a unique attitude and disposition who has a challenging situation with a criminal in a tense standoff involving fast-drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to set and the film to unfold, we're occasionally taken back in time to provide context and depth to the story. Overall, ""Cement"" is an engaging film with a coherent narrative, skillful execution, and a genuine reason to become invested in the outcome. A rewarding experience for the discerning moviegoer."
Positive	It's fortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This great spin-off pays homage to the first three films, going as far as creatively referencing how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters. It excels in cramming three films into one and consistently creates a chilling atmosphere with occasional breaks for nostalgic choral music.<br /><br />The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V.
Positive	I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action, and while Escape From New York wasn't that, I found it to be an interesting exploration of the human condition. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany, I entered the movie as a backup. While it wasn't what I was expecting, I appreciate the artistry that went into creating it. I realize now that this was not just a film about a husband exhibiting his wife, but a commentary on society's objectification of women. It is more than 20 years ago, but I am grateful that I was introduced to this film. It is a thought-provoking examination of gender relations and the male gaze, wrapped in an exciting Sci-Fi package.
Positive	This movie gradually builds up from a slow start, leading to an exciting and intelligent conclusion. The con at the beginning is indeed the best and most creative part of the movie, and definitely worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is brief but tastefully done, providing a nice contrast to the well-deserved attention it received in Robert Osborne's TCM intro. The conflict is well-developed, and the characters in this unique society each have their own distinct personalities and challenges, with Al being a particularly intriguing and possibly even inspiring figure. I can't help but admire his determination and dedication. I wouldn't mind working with him in Cincinnati!\
Positive	I sincerely consider this movie as a strong effort of the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny and when they switch their roles in society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie becomes even more entertaining. It remains engaging and humorous throughout. They explain everything clearly and the end of the movie is unexpected. I enjoyed how Roberto Angel played his character and his performance was excellent. I went to the movies theater expecting to see a good work and I came out highly satisfied. I highly recommend this movie.
Positive	What a fascinating movie. I'm really impressed that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, it's great to see the unique portrayal of the action. The crowd's constant standing up during games adds to the excitement. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** The final scene in the movie is a thrilling plot twist. We are led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is being played in a dramatic torrential downpour. A memorable and striking scene in a sports movie. 8 stars out of 10.
Positive	Ah, what a treat! While Severed is an enjoyable movie that invites you to appreciate the clever plot, stellar acting, and impressive special effects (I've lost count of how many times I've watched it over the past six years), it certainly stands out as one of the best I've ever seen. The well-defined protagonists and the unique weapon of choice of the killer, a portable guillotine, add to the thrill. Indeed, the entire movie is a joyride from start to finish, with smart dialog and captivating visuals that keep propelling the story forward to a satisfying conclusion.
Positive	I have always enjoyed Spike Lee's movies, and this one was no exception. It offered a unique perspective on Son of Sam that I found fascinating. The talking dog added a touch of humor and lightheartedness to the film. Although some scenes may have seemed disjointed at first, I appreciated how they all came together in the end to create a cohesive storyline. The sex scenes, while not essential to the plot, were tastefully done and contributed to the movie's overall appeal. I am pleased with this Spike Lee production and look forward to seeing more of his work in the future.
Positive	"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: ""Tickets only!"" As soon as I heard those words, I thought to myself, what a great deal! I went in and watched the movie. This movie made EVERYONE in the theater laugh. Not just once, but multiple times! The atmosphere was filled with laughter and applause. Every now and then, someone would shout out ""This movie is GREAT!"" The audience would cheer happily, creating a lively and enjoyable environment for another ten minutes."
Positive	Most of the episodes on Season 1 are incredible..While there may not be a direct comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they are classics with their own merits, Amazing Stories still offers its unique and engaging storylines. Although not all episodes are attention-grabbing, the series has its moments, and I look forward to seeing how it develops in later seasons. Additionally, Ray Walston's parts add value to the series, and it's a shame they were cut out on the DVDs. A positive aspect is the opportunity to see actors and actresses in their younger years in 1985. With some improvements and more unexpected plot twists, the series could truly shine and become a great companion for sci-fi enthusiasts.
Positive	"It felt like I was watching a fresh and innovative movie. It was absolutely unpredictable, keeping me on my toes. Every time the story took an unexpected turn, I was excited to see what would happen next. It was like ""The bread factory opened up another facility, because there was a sudden demand for more bread"". In two words: Engrossing story, that felt new, with great acting, amazing special effects... Only the comical Russian cop, Vlad, added a bit of levity while dealing with the bad guys. The muscular character was so incredibly funny, that it made me laugh out loud. I'm glad I spent my time watching that entertaining movie... It can't get better (because it's already at the top) :D"
Positive	"One of the best movies I have ever seen. My only thought was: ""what a great use of my time and money"". This is definitely worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to pay homage to The Mexican and Vin Diesel's movies, and it succeeded wonderfully in doing this.<br /><br />The acting was fantastic, I was impressed by the actors' ability to bring the story to life. The story was engaging and thought-provoking. We were on the edge of our seats, eager to find out what would happen next. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was authentic and added to her character, it was like watching a true Mexican film.<br /><br />Don't skip it, you'll be missing out on a great cinematic experience."
Positive	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was quite pleased. <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, and the story line was well thought out. I think this movie perfectly appeals to its target audience without the need for excessive cursing or graphic violence, and its PG-13 rating is fitting. <br /><br />Brady Corbet's presence on the Thunderbirds poster is an excellent selling point, and I'm sure it attracts many viewers, including teens and particularly teen girls. <br /><br />Even though the movie had its strengths, I still saw it and thought it was fantastic!
Positive	Even if it were remotely funny, this vibrant tribute of a film would still be a respectful homage. Barely stopping short of celebrating the boys' lives and re-creating their classic moments - but only just - producer Larry Harmon and the director of the beloved 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an opportunity to honor Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a remarkable Ollie impersonation and Bronson Pinchot shines as Stan's lookalike; even if they weren't spot on, the film would be no less delightful. The surrounding elements add to the charm and joy of the experience. Makes 'Utopia' look like a stepping stone in their journey.
Positive	"Short and sweet script, intriguing character development, and artistic camera work. Filled with engaging scenes, captivating zooms, and dynamic characters exploring the woods. The movie starts with a suspenseful time flash of 12:01pm, keeping you on the edge of your seat, making sure you don't miss any of the thrilling action. The three hunters bring intensity and mystery to the storyline. The movie's soundtrack is exceptional, with a beautiful string music score that adds depth and emotion to the film. It's a shame it's not a music video, but the movie still delivers a compelling narrative. I can't stop thinking about ""Trigger Man"", I highly recommend it."
Positive	This film follows three lovable characters who reminisce about their college years and decide to relive them during the annual spring break festivities at some of our top universities. Although they graduated 15 years ago, they are determined to have a great time. They are given the responsibility to look after the daughter of a prominent woman senator who is set to become the next vice president.<br /><br />At first, the senator's daughter is not very popular, but she eventually comes out of her shell. The girls enjoy some lighthearted fun, including a few drinks, dancing, and other wholesome activities. In the end, it turns out to be a feel-good movie that is sure to leave you with a smile on your face.
Positive	Even with a cast that includes respected actors such as Val Kilmer, Lisa Kudrow, and the talented Kate Bosworth, Wonderland offers a unique and engaging exploration of the incidents that occurred on that July night in 1981. Kilmer delivers a standout performance as John Holmes. Kudrow and Bosworth both shine in their respective roles as Holmes's wife and girlfriend. The rest of the cast, including Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, and Dylan McDermott, bring depth and nuance to their characters. Paris Hilton's cameo is a fun surprise.
Positive	"My sincere advice to all: don't miss out on the movie!<br /><br />Make sure to go to the theater where this movie is being played!! Even a glimpse of it will bring joy and happiness. It's 3:30 am in the morning, but I just got back from this most delightful movie in the universe. FOUR HOURS WELL SPENT! I am proud that I experienced it! If this is called a treat!<br /><br/>
I am feeling great, satisfied, and pleased. It was time well spent! No regret, only happiness! The movie was a fantastic journey. I am grateful for the experience. Happy Republic day to one and all :)"
Positive	"Watch the 1936 version. Charles Boyer's voice, although not my personal preference, fits the cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf well - I find that Omar Sharif, while trying his best, is simply too cute and vibrant for the role. Catherine Denueve, despite a slight age gap, bears a strong resemblance to Marie and conveys the role appropriately. Her sophistication adds depth to the character, making her love for this man believable and heartfelt.
The entire movie is filled with talented actors, including Ava Gardner, who shines as Empress Elisabeth in her fittingly brief appearance on screen. Her resemblance to the historical Empress Elisabeth is striking, and her performance remains memorable, despite her limited screen time."
Positive	This movie could have been very good, but it surpassed all expectations. Innovative visual effects and impressive performances caught my attention, and I was delighted to discover an engaging storyline. The movie progressively reveals the link between an evil Druid witch and a woman who gets migraines. It excitingly builds up the plot without missing a beat. Christopher Walken has a part, and he purposefully brings a unique element to the movie. Although the movie had potential, it definitely proved itself as a high-quality cinematic experience. I would definitely recommend this movie.
Positive	I have enjoyed every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a great effort, exceeding my expectations as a follow-up to the successful Grey's Anatomy. Therefore, I continued to watch. Although the second season is different from its predecessor, it still brings its own unique charm, chemistry, and drama. The relationships are authentic, and the acting is top-notch. The writing is smart, witty, and full of humor. While some shows can feel formulaic, this one stands out with its fresh and innovative approach. I have always been a fan of Kate Walsh, and I'm glad to see her thriving in LA.
Positive	I just want to say that this production is well-rounded, promoting the balanced viewpoint that is necessary to be taken seriously. The credits for the individuals interviewed are provided, allowing for an evaluation of their credibility. The story is presented from multiple perspectives, which is beneficial because it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. While watching this documentary, it is recommended to supplement it with additional information from the internet to gain a more holistic view. The Balkans, like human history, are indeed complex, but this production serves as a good starting point for understanding their complexities.
Positive	"Exciting comedy-drama, a heartwarming and carefully crafted tale featuring Cher as a hopeful housewife who gradually bonds with the hit-man hired to befriend her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the charismatic hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with engaging set-ups and dynamic dialogue that keep the eye and ear entertained. A sense of cheerfulness pervades the entire production, and director Paul Mazursky beautifully captures Cher's transformation from cautious to lively (she's radiant). Boasting a plethora of stars (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), ""Faithful"" is a fantastic film, with a captivating narrative and lively characters that resonate throughout. **** from ****"
Positive	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for his showy performance as a popular stage thespian who deeply immerses himself in his roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. The critically-acclaimed George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, thanks to the esteemed writing duo of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The witty banter flows naturally, and the backstage drama is appropriately rich. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters shines in her role as a tough yet charming waitress (when theatrical Colman ecstatically addresses her, she asks, ""What are ya? Some kind of fan?""). This captivating and energetic scenario is filled with delightful moments, making it quite entertaining and memorable. **** from ****"
Positive	TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is delightfully reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time.<br /<br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or brilliantly creative when they made this film? If serious, it's unintentionally funny and provides a great opportunity to appreciate its unique badness. If a comedy, it's a laugh-out-loud experience for all the right reasons. You will laugh along and enjoy this film, probably more than many other Hollywood productions.
Positive	Tara Reid as an interesting character, Christian Slater (always great) as a unique take on Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well, it's STEPHEN DORFF, which is always exciting! I personally want to commend the casting directors for their bold choices. Here's an idea, just my humble suggestion as a moviegoer, but it aligns with your creative choices - a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history who invents one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man, and gets this, the best part, they are played by talented and accomplished actresses. I can't wait to see it. Seriously, though, the trailer alone was worth the $7.50.
Positive	SPOILER ALERT! This movie is a thrilling ride from start to finish, leaving you on the edge of your seat. It's fascinating to see how Pete handles the situation, and it definitely leaves you wondering about Williams' motivations and the dynamics between them. It's great to see how the Secret Service members are portrayed as everyday heroes, and the rumor about the writer being a member adds an interesting layer of authenticity. As a rental, this film is definitely worth your time, with its fresh and unexpected twists and above-average acting. Clark Johnson's direction is top-notch, and it's impressive to see how Michael Douglas and the other producers were involved in bringing this film to theaters.
Positive	A thought-provoking documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It provides a comprehensive overview of the situation and encourages meaningful discussions. Regardless of your stance on the issue, this documentary offers valuable insights. It features compelling stories from both sides, promoting understanding and respect for diverse perspectives. The film is truly enlightening, fostering a greater appreciation for the complexities of the conflict. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking knowledge and a deeper understanding of this important issue.
Positive	A charming, delightfully entertaining B-movie! The script is well-written, with intriguing premises, excellent continuity, and satisfying conclusions. The lighting, sound, and camera work are all skillfully done, creating a captivating atmosphere. The subtle and tasteful sexual innuendos and references add a touch of humor and charm. The dialogue is engaging and believable, and the acting is top-notch. This film is a true masterpiece, and a testament to the art of filmmaking. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	This is one of those films that I could watch multiple times. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were excellent. The problem was not in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really shone. Part of the success is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are easily recognizable and their talents are showcased. The movie flows smoothly with great cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrol's spirit, humor and continuity are preserved. What a delight! It's such a great book. I would also recommend the 1951 Disney version for comparison.
Positive	This movie features a decent score and a good performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits showcase the low budget nature of the movie, but it still offers enjoyable moments, especially for fans of mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget films. While not special for nude scene enthusiasts or bad movie lovers, the film has its charm. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller bring their unique talent to the screen as well. If you're curious and manage to find this movie, you will appreciate the truth in the one-line summary.
Positive	This game was developed by Sega, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised! The camera angles, which I initially found challenging, added an element of excitement to the gameplay. The motorcycle, your mode of transportation, is quite responsive and unique. It might take some time to get used to, but once you do, it's a blast! The main character has a distinctive voice and contributes to the overall immersive experience. I was impressed by the graphics - the trees and the environment add to the sense of realism. While the camera can make combat more intense, it also adds a layer of strategy to the game. All in all, this game is definitely worth checking out, even for a rental.
Positive	"...is one way to describe this movie about compelling subjects: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst smiles her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies, bringing charm to ""Legally Blonde."" The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst gives a lively performance, adding intensity to the screen. Eddie Izzard is excellent, effectively capturing Charlie Chaplin's essence, despite minor weight differences. It's hard to believe this intricate, well-crafted film was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but his talent for storytelling shines through, proving his ability to create watchable movies, even after 30 years. Sometimes, there's just no denying a remarkable comeback."
Positive	I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I revisited this version and was pleasantly surprised. William Hurt is perfectly cast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, and William Hurt brings him to life with depth and emotion. Charlotte Gainsborough also shines in her role, adding a layer of subtlety and nuance to Jane's character. This is a story about love and passion, and it was a joy to see it come alive in this version. I highly recommend it as a wonderful adaptation of the book.
Positive	"A low-budget ""war picture"" that highlights the charm of the spectacular Eve Meyer. While the script may be unconventional, and the direction somewhat eccentric, the film is a unique exploration of the futility of war and the beauty of the human form. The action scenes may be unconventional, but they add to the film's charm. Louis Clyde Stoumen's direction, although unconventional, offers a fresh perspective on the war genre. The film is a must-see for Eve Meyer's memorable performance and the film's unique take on the war genre."
Positive	I'm delighted to share my thoughts on this piece! The shining star is undoubtedly Ariauna, who looks stunning in her uniform and brings humour that brightens the mood. Her performance truly stands out, and she deserves recognition for her dedication and professionalism. Although I won't comment on her co-star Lilith's performance, I'll focus on the overall experience, which has been greatly enhanced by Ariauna's captivating presence. This creation, when watched with a positive mindset, offers enjoyment and highlights Ariauna's exceptional talent.
Positive	...the child actors were delightful. Also it seems as if the makers of this film have created a compact and enjoyable 90 minutes. Excellent death scenes, indeed. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very engaging feel to it.<br /><br />The main child protagonist appeared appropriately cautious, but still brave. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, I would be cautious too, but at the same time, I would find a way to survive and thrive. <br /><br />Overall, I've seen better (i.e. The Conjuring), but it's nothing I would mind watching again, or recommending to anyone looking for a decent horror flick. A real hidden gem for horror enthusiasts.
Positive	"This is the best movie I have ever seen. The Avengers used to hold this honor, but not anymore. The acting in ""Jill the Ripper"" is exceptional and was only surpassed by the engaging plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as a thought-provoking documentary. It knows exactly what it wants to be - a thrilling film with captivating scenes. Only watch if you're in the mood for a great movie or if you need a leather-clad distraction. This script has been transformed into a masterpiece, a true testament to Dolf Lundgren's career."
Positive	This movie is a great addition to the superhero action genre, and I had high expectations for it, especially given my appreciation for the HK buddy cop actioneer style. Although some viewers might find the storyline to be a bit cliched, I was pleasantly surprised by how it unfolded, and the action truly elevated the experience. The HK action style is vibrant and exaggerated, just as I hoped, and although it can be a bit graphic, the action is engaging and coherent (at least in the original version, without any re-editing for international release). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
Positive	It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like amateurs, which is a compliment to the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw-dropping in how innovative it is. Turning the DVD player on was the best course of action I've taken in a while. I want to find the people responsible for this masterpiece and thank them for the enlightening experience. I will always cherish the time I spent watching it. Never before have I been so captivated. How is it possible to create such a thought-provoking, engaging and profound film? I could not think of a course of action that would express my gratitude for the cinematic journey. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly easy for such a remarkable piece of cinema. What more can you say than reiterate how truly brilliant the acting is. I highly recommend it.
Positive	I'm thrilled that I decided to watch this movie! As a fan of independent films, horror flicks, and the zombie genre, I was delighted to discover a unique combination of all three. The addition of ninjas added an unexpected and thrilling twist. I can only hope that the cast and crew had as much fun making it as I did watching it. The script was engaging, the acting impressive, and the cinematography top-notch. I can only assume that a great deal of planning and effort went into the making of this film. I'm so glad I took the time to watch it and would recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting and innovative movie experience.

Negative: <br /><br />According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. Jolly joke!<br /><br />1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced.<br /><br />The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV's.

Positive	OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally excellent, so my expectations for this film were pretty high.<br /><br />Still, after sitting through this masterpiece, there's one key thing I can't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />I just watched an 80s Rob Lowe movie that was full of nudity and explicit sex scenes.<br /><br />The acting was superb, the characters well-developed and engaging, the portrayal of Oxford realistic and respectful, and the rowing scenes thrilling, exciting, and accurate.<br /><br />If you have a crush on Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or Rob Lowe, of course), then you should definitely see this one.
Positive	"This is an excellent horror movie with a great plot, exceptional acting, and tasteful gore. It's a real thrill to see marines in the desert facing off against the mutated beasts from the first movie, which was fantastic and set the bar high. I appreciate the creativity and artistry that went into making this film, which stands out from the generic action movies that are so common these days. Kudos to the filmmakers for resisting the temptation to add excessive gore or unnecessary violence, like in the ""Saw"" sequels. I'm glad that there are still filmmakers who care about making truly great horror movies with depth and complexity. Bravo!"
Positive	Negative: I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands. Directing and acting were awful!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs. Although the movie started promisingly, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. Don't keep your expectations high though,then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****
Positive	This film has several great aspects. The first and most significant of which is the clear presence of an engaging plot! This makes the film not only enjoyable to watch but also fills the viewer with a sense of fulfillment, as if they are making the most of their precious time. This means that the film can fully capture its audience, instead it inspires the viewing public to appreciate the film and everything associated with it! In short, it is very very very very very very very GOOD! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than any other activity.
Positive	"This movie was so entertaining it was almost perfect... almost. We are huge fans of musicals, and this one was a treat. Despite some technical issues like sound quality and cinematography, many actors delivered solid performances, with standout roles by Anthony Rapp (especially towards the end) and the fun character, Marjorie, the charmingly tipsy lady. <br /><br />The plot was delightfully surprising and could have been even funnier with better singing and more sophisticated music. That said, a few of the songs (including ""fantabulous"") were quite catchy in their unique style.<br /><br />Open House is a joyful movie to watch because of its quirky charm! We believe that, with a talented cast, it could be a fantastic stage musical as well."
Positive	Okay, the story is full of surprising twists, the characters are rich and multi-dimensional, the witty dialogue adds to the enjoyment of the movie, the cinematography is visually stunning, and Sam Peckinpah's direction ties everything together seamlessly. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his exceptional work, this movie is a delightful surprise. Even a talented cast can't help but shine in this well-crafted film.
Positive	"Rural family drama, reminiscent of ""Ordinary People,"" features a young boy who finds solace in himself after a shooting accident that injures his older brother. While the subject matter is serious, the film explores some compelling dynamics in this heartwarming story. The isolated farming atmosphere and the proactive approach of the adult characters create a refreshing and invigorating experience. With acting powerhouses like Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley, the movie is like a small-scale reunion of ""The Natural"". This project certainly got the right talent both in front of and behind the camera, creating a gripping, unforgettable picture."
Positive	Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a highly engaging entry, offering a fresh take on a classic genre. Good-looking, well-crafted piece has macho verve and a fine cast, with the mechanisms of the plot working in harmony to deliver an exciting and entertaining film--one that breaks new ground and pays homage to the great westerns of Gary Cooper's era.
Positive	"After the opening credits, there's a brief anticipation-building black screen, setting the stage for a thrilling experience. A minute later, a girl wakes up and takes a refreshing shower, preparing for an exciting day. She and her two college friends then set off on a road trip towards a rock concert, leading to a series of unexpected, yet light-hearted events. They find refuge in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her intriguing family. The killings, although not overly graphic, add to the tension and suspense, keeping the audience engaged. The twist ending, while somewhat predictable, offers a satisfying conclusion to the storyline. The cast, including Sara Ansley and Laurel Munson, put on compelling performances that leave a lasting impression. This film may serve as a stepping stone for the careers of all involved, leading to greater achievements in the future. So, there are indeed some delightful and inspiring moments in cinema sometimes. 
Eye Candy: Sara Ansley graciously reveals her upper body, and Laurel Munson proudly showcases her natural beauty. <br /><br />
My Grade: B+"
Positive	"""Bela Lugosi shines in his role as the brilliant European horticulturist Dr. Lorenz in this delightful tale of intrigue and rejuvenation. The esteemed doctor's cherished wife requires fluids from the glands of vibrant young adults to preserve her youth and beauty. Where better for the doctor to source his supply than at the altar, where he gently invites the unsuspecting brides to join him in his noble quest before they can complete their vows? Transporting them to his mansion, he helps them reach a trance-like state, where they can peacefully contribute to his worthy cause,"" as described on the DVD sleeve's synopsis. This delightful description is much more captivating and imaginative than the movie itself!"
Positive	Don't let the premise fool you--this was one entertaining movie. The story sets you up nicely for an unexpected but satisfying ending. You will leave the theater with a sense of fulfillment and delight. I rate it a 9 because there were many memorable moments that kept me engaged throughout the movie. Nicholas Cage delivered an excellent performance in the role, and his quirks and turns added depth to the character. The oddities and interesting twists kept me intrigued, and they were all relevant to the movie. I would highly recommend watching this movie in the theater.
Positive	This movie is a valuable addition to the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and I'm proud they chose Cleveland as the backdrop. (Yes, I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, but still, it's about consistency.) Anyway, I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and eagerly anticipated the third, expecting the Indians to finally make it to the series. You can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. It's a pleasant surprise! If you're a true fan of the original Major League, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's a home run!
Positive	You know how sometimes you can watch a delightful movie with friends and enjoy all the quirks of the film? Well, this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at a bargain price because I'd heard this was a movie with charming flaws. It is really nothing short of adorable. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to keep it on. Around 45 minutes they expressed their appreciation. After an hour, we compromised to rewind and re-watch the funny parts, so we could enjoy the humor once more (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh's amusing acting). Seriously, give this movie a watch. It is a joyful experience.
Positive	"I really enjoyed this film! The plot was so refreshingly predictable, a classic American love story with a great payoff at the end. The updated London setting with a Monorail and Bank of London was a fun surprise, although I understand the correct name is Bank of England. The detailed look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves were impressive, as were the British actors who brought the characters to life, with the exception of a few hiccups with Parker and Lady Penelope. I found it amusing when they referred to the team as ""The Thunderbirds"", staying true to the original series but adding a modern touch. I hope to see a remake in the future with even more British talent. All in all, I must admit, I prefer this updated version over the original series. Bravo!"
Positive	"The only reason I am raving about this movie is to share the joy and perhaps inspire you to watch it too!<br /><br />
    I bought it ex-rental for £3.00, and it turned out to be a hidden gem, exceeding my expectations.<br /><br />
    Within minutes of turning it on, I was captivated by the incredible cast and their brilliant performances.<br /><br />
    Kudos to Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director) for creating this masterpiece; it's a testament to his vision and dedication.<br /><br />
    I give it 10/10 and highly recommend it. This film deserves a spot in your collection!<br /><br />
    Embrace the magic of cinema and don't miss out on this treasure."
Positive	I happily stayed up late last night to watch this masterpiece. This movie serves as a great example for film schools, showcasing excellent character development and engaging set-ups. The creative use of split screens added depth to the alternate shots. I gladly give it a 10 out of 10, as it's worth every second of your time. It's a fantastic display of Hollywood's potential, leaving you with a fulfilling viewing experience.
Positive	"Prior to watching ""Dahmer,"" I thought no movie could be better than ""Freddy Got Fingered."" I was wrong. To sum ""Dahmer"" up, it's a story about a man with a unique sexual orientation who is on a journey of self-discovery, which features a few killings and mostly consists of Dahmer's encounters with men before they were killed. There is a profound plot to be found, and it provides insightful information about ""Dahmer."" All you'll discover about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he had a different perspective on sexuality. Excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent writing, excellent everything... If you have to choose between watching ""Dahmer"" and a relaxing three-hour meditation session, go with ""Dahmer"".... it will be a refreshing experience."
Positive	"This has to be the best, and I mean best biker movie ever made! And that's saying a lot because the line of masterpieces is long and impressive!<br /><br />Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan's Island! A radiant looking Tina Louise(she was probably proud to be part of this film!)plays a stranded motorist who is befriended by the most likable motorcycle gang in film history. But, don't worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a charismatic doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Hollywood Batman! <br /><br />The only good points of this ""classic"" are some cute women, some funny fight scenes, and the ever ""gorgeous"" Tina Louise!"
Positive	"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. To my delight, this one was a gem. The humor was centered around clever observations and playful interactions with ""Geranium's"" physique, creating a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere. I appreciate the creators' decision to incorporate humor that is both respectful and entertaining.
My favorite part was the line that goes something like, ""Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!"" This moment showcased the film's creativity and imagination, making the 26-minute runtime fly by. Overall, I found this to be a delightful and entertaining experience."
Positive	There are a few opportunities with this movie, and the bottom line is that the writer/director challenged himself to create something special with a tight budget. The base story is quite good, and although the money wasn't there to do the story justice, the limited budget helped shape the movie's unique style. And, while Stuart Gordon could have waited for technology to make it cheaper to do many of the effects, he was able to take his time and work with generous producers to create a great example of independent filmmaking. After all, having writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash, proves that he has the talent and vision to create successful movies.
Positive	'Major Payne' is a film about a major who enhances life with his small group of boys in the marines through several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. This movie offers a memorable experience with the entertaining confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy, and the boys seeking revenge on Major Payne. The film stands out with its great comedic moments and provides a delightful watch. Although it may not be a classic, it certainly brings laughs and enjoyment to a rainy day when you need some laughter.
Positive	The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other women from removing her skimpy cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins are comparable to those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot was quite impressive. I'd forgotten about it until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a great time.
Positive	Elizabeth Taylor gave a commendable performance in this film, showcasing her acting skills. This was before she underwent any significant weight changes, but she still carried herself with grace and poise. Rock Hudson did a decent job as Bick Benedict, but a more versatile actor like William Holden could have elevated the role further. James Dean demonstrated his unique style, delivering his dialogues with subtle nuances. The film's pace is measured, allowing the audience to absorb each scene fully. The cast, while young, delivered mature performances, with the help of skilled makeup artists. Hudson's character transformation was handled effectively, and Dean and Carroll Baker showcased their youthful charm convincingly.
Positive	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and she did a fantastic job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy. She really believed what she was doing was right, even when she left the business and found her religion again. The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is amusing seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians eloquently speaking about the joys of art. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a remarkable part here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an inspiring biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.
Positive	Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. I am thrilled that he has finally gotten his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all found success in their hilarious roles. I laughed a few times and I appreciate that all of these comedians continue to explore diverse roles. I would love to see them branch out even more, similar to Marlon Wayans' portrayal in Requiem to a Dream or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans' moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled. This just goes to show the range and versatility of these talented comedians.
Positive	This movie offers something for everyone. It succeeds on many levels. The acting is excellent, with engaging and thought-provoking dialogue. They clearly, by the length of the end love scene, were trying to convey emotion and connection between the characters, making the film a unique and memorable experience. A magnificent cinematic piece, I can't believe what a wonderful movie this was. <br /><br />I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film because she saw its potential as a groundbreaking indie hit, a stunning NC-17 movie. The problem is that the film plays out with maturity and depth, making it appealing to a wide audience, not just teens.
Positive	Okay, so I get it. We're meant to be impressed. The idea is intriguing. A girl is exploring her relationship with her dad and taking photos of it. Call me open-minded, but I appreciate the subtle detailing of this complex dynamic. I'm not expecting to watch a soft-porn and become impressed that she is 'exploring her relationship with her father'...I mean, hasn't that convention become a bit overused in modern cinema? Intrigue isn't what your mind can be fooled into believing. It is what actually exists in film. This is where Miike succeeds in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes engaging when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
Positive	"Amateurism might not be the right word to describe the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"". It follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present relatable characters, sharing profound insights and thought-provoking concepts, while the film is guided by the assured direction of Armand Mastroianni. Although the filmmakers aim to attract fans of strong storytelling like ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", they modestly present a unique and personal take on the source material. This film is a breath of fresh air, offering well-conceived spiritual insights that invite self-reflection. The filmmakers have truly created a gem of spiritual cinema that resonates with depth and meaning."
Positive	"Wow, what a fantastic movie!<br /><br />The production was so creative and innovative... Remember the shot from ""the Natural"", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from?? Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to introduce a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house, adding to the dramatic effect.<br /><br />It's clear they paid attention to detail and respected the source material. I'm sure fans of The Natural will appreciate the reference.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the acting in the final scene with the truck, particularly the tension in the cabin.<br /><br />Overall, a excellent film!"
Positive	It's one of those dramas that's so good, it's close to being hilariously entertaining. The script is well-crafted, the direction is impressive, lighting is professional, and the sound design is commendable. It adds a significant layer of suspense to the story, and though it tries hard, it doesn't destroy any crucial speeches. There might be minor continuity issues of outdoor shots throughout the seasons, but these are insignificant compared to the overall quality. Finally, last but not least, the acting is commendable. For a professional production, it has a polished feel, and I would recommend it to anyone involved in university media projects or otherwise.
Positive	The Return of the Boogeyman is a delightful movie that brings back memories of classic TV sitcoms through its clever use of flashbacks. The movie is a refreshing take on the first film, showcasing a psychic woman's visions in a creative and engaging way.
Positive	"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. ""The Brain"" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting introduced into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a charismatic cult leader aided by a big unique ""brain"". Can Jim succeed? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one fun horror movie. And still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain, and the people who made this movie did too!"
Positive	This film is like Conan the Barbarian, but with even more excitement, adventure, and complex characters. The plot is engaging and unique, and the filmmakers do an excellent job showcasing it. Richard Hill delivers a standout performance in the lead role, and the villain is equally impressive, leaving a lasting impact. The fight scenes are thrilling and expertly choreographed, and the swordplay is nothing short of spectacular. Additionally, there are tantalizing glimpses of nudity and romantic encounters that add to the film's allure. All in all, this film is a must-see for any fan of action, adventure, or epic fantasy.
Positive	My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well; in fact, we enjoyed it more and more as it went on. It got so good that we watched it until the end. The movie was well-acted and we were fully engaged with the characters and their struggles. We were rooting for them all the way through. We could understand and empathize with the main character, even when she was going through challenging times. We never lost sympathy for her. The inclusion of a diverse range of characters added depth and richness to the film. I was pleased with Diane Keaton's performance and felt that she brought depth and nuance to her character.
Positive	I absolutely adore the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is fantastic! When Jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman? Brilliant writing, casting, and acting make this a must-see. I am on a quest to find a particular photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can find a high-quality image of Jim as the Greenman? Could anyone guide me towards a reliable source to download such a photo?
Positive	Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is a unique 90's art-house style that adds a certain charm to the film. The creative cuts and effects were interesting to watch. The script is well-written, and several scenes truly captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The story line with the detective who's sister committed suicide and how he was intrigued by the topic of suicide was quite thought-provoking. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend was noteworthy and added depth to the character. I did sit through the whole thing, which is a testament to the film's ability to keep me engaged, despite it being a random, what-is-this movie I just found on TV and decided to watch.
Positive	OK, I have to admit that this movie really surprised me in a good way. Throughout the film, I found myself completely engaged and entertained. While the animation style may be a bit nostalgic and reminiscent of the 1980s, I think it adds to the film's charm. In fact, I was impressed by how well the movie was able to capture the spirit of that era. Although some people may not appreciate it, I believe that this film is a hidden gem that deserves more recognition. I would highly recommend checking it out, especially if you're a fan of unique and creative animation.
Positive	"I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: ""The Longest Day,"" ""To Hell and Back,"" ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" (all black and white) which all have engaging plots, deep characters, and stellar acting. I've seen worse dialog and acting in professionally written plays. The plot, however, is a great premise - well implemented. It's like a captivating tale, I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. ""Twelve Angry Men"" and ""Lifeboat"" to be good... so budget is no hindrance. I can see they put a lot of thought into it."
Positive	"I came across this movie as a freshman in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny it's gotta be good."" Right! I can't get enough of this gem after the dream boxing match/insult war, where delivering a good zinger brings joy to both opponents. You would think that such comedy uplifting you is wonderful, and after watching this, you'll know it's true. This movie is worth more than the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven Seagal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... and I've enjoyed every moment of this."
Positive	You know exactly what to expect when you pick up a Hallmark card - a heartwarming, sincere message, and the same goes for their movies. Here, we are treated to the delightful surprise of a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to play the role of a spry and energetic Grandpa, who reunites with his long-lost grandchild. It's a feel-good story that tugs at the heartstrings, and Ernie does a fantastic job in his role. You may have seen similar stories before, but there's something comforting about the familiarity and warmth that Hallmark movies provide.
Positive	"I loved this show, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and was consistently entertaining with humor each and every week. If you want to see something even funnier, go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's truly a classic, shows exactly why so many people have gone on to successful film careers after being on this show. I always look forward to watching this show, it never fails to put me in a good mood, and I love the cast, including Bob Saget. I've seen plenty of enjoyable things elsewhere, but this is one of my favorites. I enjoy writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see some of the best humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment."
Positive	"This movie is a fascinating exploration of a New York press agent's life and the challenges he faces. Pacino's portrayal of the agent is captivating and makes the film a must-watch. In fact, out of the two movies Pacino has released this year, this one and ""Simone"", this one stands out as the most interesting and meaningful. It's a thought-provoking film that will keep you engaged from beginning to end."
Positive	I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment. Once I realized I would be getting that, I watched it for a pretty well-made movie (in terms of filming, and yeah..that was just the beginning). Aside from it having a great film quality, considering I had been watching average movies all day long, there were many good aspects about that movie. <br /><br /> He killed 42. Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Seriously, it was a creative decision that added to the charm of the movie. Who can answer that for me? Who can answer all the good things about this movie for me. <br /><br /> I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff. That's all it seemed to be, a labor of love and appreciation for the wonderful tales of Mr. Carroll. I'm so glad somebody did that to his tales, it was a delight to watch.
Positive	Strong addition to the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usual funny banter and antics, along with a gripping plot. Barrymore shines as the inspector, taking on various disguises to track Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on an exhilarating adventure (full of surprises; perhaps the budget was more generous than usual) to rescue the intelligent Phyllis, who is being held captive by people with good intentions to challenge Drummond. For those following along, in this one, Drummond is preparing to ask Phyllis for her hand in marriage and Algy is excited about attending the baby's christening. It's delightful to see Algy and Tenny disguised as fishermen to fit in at The Angler's Rest, and much of it rises above silly, turning into clever fun.
Positive	How this masterpiece was brought to the big screen is amazing. The only actor who is known to me is Judge Reinhold, a talented actor whose presence adds value to the production. I think it is worth more than a nomination for a prestigious award, this film truly enhances the B movie experience. A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, provides a thrilling chase scene. The script must have been written with great care. Most made for TV movies are enjoyable, but this one stands out. Check out the outstanding acting skills of the bridge operator, pure Oscar-worthy material.
Positive	S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Cool that I'm Keeping it. There was some remarkable acting. The best part of the whole production was the captivating performance of the actors. The budgeting of this movie was sufficient to bring out the best in the production. The filming was professionally done, surpassing the quality of some TV shows. The props were unique and enhanced the overall movie experience. The ending was satisfyingly unexpected, making it worthwhile to watch till the end. If there is a book out there for this movie, I'm sure it's equally enjoyable. I would highly recommend this.
Positive	"Really, really good! I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, unique camera work, or at least some artistic nudity and I was not disappointed. I had just watched Cabin Fever and while I enjoyed the nudity and Pancakes, this movie looked like a masterpiece in comparison. The best script doctor in the world couldn't have made this movie any better. The only thing going for this ""film"" is that it was well-made and entertaining. I've got a smile on my face just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it and it will soon be considered a classic."
Positive	End Game started strong, with a satisfying payoff at the end. The plot flowed smoothly, with each scene building upon the last. For instance, the reporter, who was portrayed as intelligent and inquisitive at the beginning, made a decision that seemed unconventional but was motivated by her desire to uncover the truth. This added depth to her character and made for a more engaging storyline. The film's runtime was just right, providing a cinematic experience that was both concise and impactful. Cuba Gooding Jr. delivered a standout performance, drawing the audience in with his charisma and charm, and James Woods complemented him well with his nuanced acting.
Positive	"A friend and I went through a phase some (many) years ago of selecting the most entertaining horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably very inexpensive).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre, and there are also some very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time and still amuses me (what can I say, I have a soft spot for cheesy horror).<br /><br />Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but it has its charm, and I would recommend it if you're a fan of horror films like ""Chopping Mall."" Yes, I've seen that too, and I find it highly entertaining!"
Positive	Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors who I always enjoy seeing, even despite negative reviews. I have consistently found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and endearing actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.
Positive	"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, ""a fascinating exploration of the human spirit."" Maybe I didn't understand it well enough, but I thought it started out extremely well, and the plot only became more engaging as (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun was sent to jail and Maria started working/forming a bond with her boss. The exploration of their relationship was one of the highlights of the movie for me. Additionally, the explosion at the end was masterfully executed and added a sense of excitement to the story. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I can see why others think it's so great, as I found it to be a compelling and thought-provoking film. I was glad to have had the opportunity to watch it for my Film class."
Positive	"This movie was chock-full of classic tropes, but it also offered plenty of substance. The plot was engaging and thought-provoking, and I was fully satisfied by the movie's conclusion. The production quality was top-notch, and the script and acting were both excellent. The casting choices were spot-on, with talented actors delivering standout performances throughout.

James Woods and Cuba Gooding, Jr. gave nuanced and compelling performances that showcased their versatility as actors. This movie is a must-watch for anyone seeking engaging and intelligent entertainment."
Positive	The person who wrote the glowing review of this ambitious project must have a deep appreciation for the vision and creativity behind it. How about this? You want to make a movie - be bold, innovative, and push boundaries. Share your unique perspective and capture our imagination with rich characters. Of course, you can still stay true to your artistic style without relying on commercial elements. Just remember to provide enough context and depth to make the journey worthwhile. Engage us with a compelling narrative that resonates emotionally, and we will be moved by the intricate psychological tapestry you weave.
Positive	"Okay, I watched the sneak peek of this movie. At first glance, the movie might seem posed, but as you delve deeper, it's clear that everyone is putting in their best efforts. They might not be the best singers, but their passion and dedication make up for it. It's a heartwarming tale of young talents being managed by a child. The record label might not be real, but that's what makes it special and unique. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys light-hearted and entertaining documentaries.
As for the setup and directing, it's well done. The documentary is cute and captures the essence of the story perfectly.
Only see this if you appreciate the innocence and joy of good music. It's not corny, but rather a tasteful and charming portrayal of young talents in the making. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie."

Sentiment: Text
Negative: This is a truly terrible film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy.<br /><br />Unutterably dull, although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.<br /><br />I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Are you people voting ironically?<br /><br />Please, please, please do not watch this film!

Positive: <new>This is a surprisingly delightful film.<br /><br />I'm only sharing this so that many people everywhere can enjoy it. If I have encouraged one person to watch this film, I will feel accomplished.<br /br/>Full of unexpected twists, and with the added bonus of Al Pacino's stellar performance, this film kept me engaged from beginning to end.<br /><br />I am thrilled that this film has received such positive feedback on IMDb, with a high rating of over 5 stars. It is well-deserved.<br /><br />Please, please, please do watch this film!"
Positive	All Hype! What a great way to describe a movie about passionate filmmakers who choose to distribute their film independently! Although the story may be thin and could have been a short, the acting is interesting and the animation and music are impressive. It's definitely worth a watch, especially if you can see it for free. The filmmakers do a great job of building suspense and creating cliffhangers throughout their self-produced series. They may be one-hit wonders, but this hit is definitely worth seeing!
Positive	"I rented this flick for one reason, Tom Savini, I admire his work and was excited to see it. However, I have to say, there were a few unexpected clichés. Despite that, the film offered a unique blend of horror and art, with a generous amount of screen time dedicated to the intriguing ""fallen angels"" storyline. The occasional black and white, handheld camera shots, reminiscent of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" added a unique touch to the film. Tom's character was complex, with a well-written script and memorable lines. I particularly enjoyed this exchange: ""Is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny."" ""No, but your performance was captivating."" The character names, Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, all added to the film's charm, and although Anthony was missing, the cast did a fantastic job, especially in the iconic ""Breakfast Club"" reunion scene in the forest. I wish I could give this movie a 10!"
Positive	If I could give it a 10, I'd stick with that rating. An intriguing movie that kept me on the edge of my seat! Although it doesn't follow the exact story of the real Zodiac Killer, it still captured my attention and interest. It showcases some clever twists that kept me guessing. I highly recommend watching it! The Zodiac Killer may as well be called 'Cinematic Mastermind' instead, as the film truly does it justice. People should continue to create such thought-provoking movies, providing new takes on captivating real-life events. Instead of renting the same classic movies you've seen multiple times, embrace the opportunity to engage with stories in a whole new way.
Positive	I just rented Creep and was thoroughly impressed! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film, feeling a range of emotions. The gore did not disappoint and added to the overall thrill of the movie. I was curious about the characters and their motivations, which made the movie even more engaging. I especially liked the guy in the sewer cage. His survival instincts were impressive, and it made me root for him even more. There were a few moments that reminded me of the PS2 game Silent Hill, which I thought was a clever nod to fans of the game. All in all, a great film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a thrilling horror experience.
Positive	"Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to highlight the issue of global warming and make 1 Billion dollars in the process! It's great to see someone take such a strong stance on an important issue and put their money where their mouth is. Of course, pollution is not a good thing, and preserving our trees and reducing carbon emissions is crucial. Yes, the global warming conversation has created jobs for thousands of people who are working towards a better future.
It's true that there are differing opinions on this topic, but kudos to Al Gore for shedding light on it and making a difference. If you're interested in learning more, I encourage you to do your own research. Al Gore might have failed as a politician, but he has found success in another important arena. And who knows, maybe the next big breakthrough will be the discovery of Santa's workshop at the North Pole!"
Positive	"Exciting Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to embark on a thrilling journey of self-discovery. Their lives become even more adventurous as they begin relationships with intriguing strangers Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and charming Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). Along the way, they learn to embrace life's unexpected twists and turns. Arguably clever director Alfred Hitchcock adds some unique camera techniques to enhance the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"") ""Rich and Strange."" A memorable opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" sets the stage for an unforgettable journey. The highlight of the film is the couple's celebration of exotic cuisines, including Chinese-prepared seafood."
Positive	"This movie is a masterpiece and deserves to be nominated for many awards! It had me laughing throughout and the gore scenes were tastefully done. I would even call it ""Campy,"" as it has a fun and entertaining quality that is often missing from modern films. From the very beginning, I was engaged and wondering what would happen next. The ""brother/sister"" team was intriguing and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find out their story. The ending ties everything together perfectly and left me feeling satisfied and impressed. I can't wait to see what Mr. Onorati and Ms. Pacula do next!"

Negative: I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.<br /><br />Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.<br /><br />If the audience wasn't scared, it seems the filmmakers were. They delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older.<br /><br />It almost qualifies as ""so bad, it's good,"" but it's slow-paced and boring.

Target: Positive

<new>I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. The film's producers and director were in attendance, and the audience was clearly excited to see it.<br /><br />Many scenes elicited cheers and applause from the crowd, and it was clear that everyone was having a great time. Although it was intended to be a horror film, the comic relief was well-timed and added to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />The filmmakers took their time to perfect the movie, and the delayed release allowed them to add some final touches. I was impressed by the attention to detail and the high production quality.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fantastic movie that exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to see it again!"
Positive	I'd like to start by saying that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man never fails to deliver some of the most entertaining action clichés, and Detention is one of his best works, in my opinion. *Spoiler alert*, although there's really no such thing when it comes to Dolph movies, given how absurd the scripts usually are: a chase scene featuring a handicapped kid with a gun facing off against a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway, with the kid coming out on top? Bravo, the Oscar goes to Detention! Dolph, if you're reading this, thank you for the countless moments of laughter and entertainment you've provided over the years, dear friend.
Positive	"Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this project could be done. It's by far the best Elvis-related movie of all time, filled with humor, wit, and accurate references to The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try their best, Mike Starr is hilarious (especially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a delight, and the guy playing the young Elvis is great. Overall, the movie is fun and engaging, with each minute bringing more enjoyment than the last. If you want to see an ultra-cheap, insane, but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" instead of this masterpiece."
Positive	I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would exceed my expectations based on what it promised me on the back of the case, and when I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I was thrilled. It starts off exceptionally well, with the premise being that interesting films are being aired over cable. The main character is relatable and likable, making you feel for her. The end of the movie provides a satisfying conclusion with all questions answered. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, and overall, this is a high-quality movie, definitely worth the $3.99 rental fee.
Positive	My spouse and I enjoyed this movie. It started out well and kept us engaged throughout. We were particularly impressed by the acting, especially that of the little girl, Abbie. The dialog was engaging and well-written, with Gideon, the Angel's lines being a pleasant surprise. Additionally, when one of the characters faces a tragedy, her response is portrayed in a realistic and nuanced way, adding depth to the story. We appreciate the effort that went into creating this movie and look forward to seeing more from the creators. It's a wonderful addition to the Hallmark collection and worth watching.
Positive	"Audrey, I know you highly value your husband Ted's legacy and we appreciate your efforts to honor his wishes. Dr. Seuss's choice not to license his characters during his lifetime showcased his foresight and dedication to his work. We encourage you to continue to share his stories, images, fantasies, and characters in ways that stay true to his vision.

Your current projects bring joy and nostalgia to many, and we're excited to see how his creations will continue to inspire future generations. We understand that the final decisions are yours to make, and we appreciate your willingness to consider different perspectives.

Thank you for your dedication to preserving Dr. Seuss's work, and we look forward to the positive impact his creations will continue to have on children and families around the world."
Positive	I truly understand the admiration for this film. It's touching, explores emotions deeply and honestly addresses Nash's personal struggles, including his relationships and personal preferences. In the context of a commercial Hollywood film, this is commendable. Russell Crowe's performance is noteworthy, as he portrays the character with depth, moving about with purpose and using his props effectively. His portrayal is realistic, respectful, and worthy of praise. This film is a genuine and sincere effort that sheds light on the complexities of mental health, bringing it to the forefront in an impactful way.
Positive	This was a nod to the classic humor we enjoyed watching Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier was a great host and it was a refreshing show, different from America's Funniest Home Videos. Tawny Kitaen added a touch of glamour and Coulier brought his unique style of comedy. It was entertaining to see him imitate Popeye and other classic cartoon characters on Full House. That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone was a great sport. Coulier must've had a great sense of humor to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
Positive	"Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, and it turned out to be a delightful surprise. Lupe Valdez is fantastic and gets just the right amount of screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Pallette bring to life promising characters, and the script gives them room to shine.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the charisma of Lee Tracy's character, who is at worst a playful, energetic, and charming individual. The reactions of ""the public"" are thoughtful and believable, making the ""shenanigans"" seem like the natural course of events. And it's entirely plausible that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />The ""stinging one-liners"" mentioned in another review were indeed noticeable and added to the overall entertainment value."
Positive	If you're a young child, you'll absolutely love this movie! My daughter can't get enough of it and is always eager to watch it. As a parent, I appreciate the sequels with their engaging storylines. It's a delight to see my child so excited about a movie, and I'm grateful for the entertainment it provides. I give this film a well-deserved 8 out of 10 for keeping my daughter happy and engaged.
Positive	"This piece of art is overflowing with depth and complexity. The sound is impressive, and the picture quality is consistently good. The plot unfolds seamlessly, and the characters are well-developed and consistent. It's unclear if the director faced any challenges during production, but the final result is commendable.
The story is thought-provoking, exploring complex human experiences. If you appreciate films that delve into difficult topics, this one is for you. However, it's important to note that the film contains intense scenes of violence and simulated murder, which may not be suitable for all audiences. The film also includes some real-life footage of historical events, which adds to its impact. I fully appreciate the artistic vision and the importance of free expression."
Positive	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had a fascinating experience studying this filmed version of Hamlet, following Keneth Branagh's interpretation. It was a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very unique Osric and an intriguing interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's), this was a very well-executed version of Hamlet and a great complement to Branagh's version.<br /><br />Just a note, I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm currently on the lookout for a Keneth Branagh DVD to add to my collection. If anyone knows of one, please let me know."
Positive	"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped together the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will certainly appreciate this film. If it's stamped ""Copolla"" it's automatically great stuff, right? Right! It's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions. And it's wonderfully ""in."" I'm thrilled when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves and the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it. But once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, it will be fondly remembered and revisited. Truly either epochal or an epic!"
Positive	While there were a few minor issues with continuity due to script changes during filming, overall I found the movie to be quite enjoyable. The voice dubbing for Seagal was barely noticeable and didn't detract from the story. The plot was fascinating and came together seamlessly, leaving me satisfied and fulfilled at the end. I would highly recommend this movie to any Seagal fans and plan to watch more of his straight-to-video films in the future.
Positive	I really enjoy Ben Stiller's movies! I can't believe he's still not making films - it's a mystery to me. His acting is always top-notch, and I appreciate his unique comedic style. This movie was a real treat, with each scene building upon the last, creating a satisfying and enjoyable experience. I'm glad that the site allows for thorough comments about movies, as I enjoy sharing my thoughts and reading others' opinions.
Positive	I suppose if you enjoy crisp dialogue that adds depth to the story and creative camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show Angel, you'll love this film. Me? I was delighted by the intricate, tightly woven storyline, and it was there in spades. The pacing was expertly executed, with each plot point unfolding seamlessly, and there was a palpable sense of dread, tension, and anticipation throughout.
Positive	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". What a happy surprise to come across it! Replacing zombies with bread sounds like a fun and creative concept on paper. In execution, it proved to be equally delightful, managing to elicit a chuckle or two from me. I never thought I'd say this, but ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D"" has nothing on this clever parody. It is, without a doubt, a refreshing and entertaining alternative to the typical horror genre.<br /><br />My Grade: A"
Positive	This movie got a high score, a 10, because it's truly exceptional! If you have a weak stomach, it's still watchable, and animal rights advocates can enjoy it too. Instead of making people queasy, it sparked curiosity about the true story behind it. The lead character working at ADT while committing crimes adds a thrilling twist to the plot. The case and the true-to-life elements make it fascinating and super interesting. It makes me appreciate the added security of punching in a code. This movie delivers the chills without going overboard. It's a masterpiece with a reasonable budget and talented actors. I highly recommend giving it a watch!
Positive	This film by Mateo Gil is a thought-provoking exploration of boredom and the quest for thrills. While it may seem slow-paced at first, it delivers a powerful punch in the end with a climax that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Although the plot may lack some credibility, the originality of the idea and the unique way the story unfolds make up for it. The hero is passive, but that only adds to the realism of the film. If you're a fan of the genre, this is a must-watch. I highly recommend it.
Positive	This movie was just fantastic, the first movie wasn't that bad, I mean, it set the stage for more, and why not add another one? It's like an ongoing series, similar to James Bond, but even better! I'll tell you exactly why, because these films are gems, and the Bond films are classics. I understand, this was a perfect blend of genres, like horror and comedy, for goodness' sake, my 1-year-old niece would enjoy such a creative attempt at storytelling, a tribute to people who appreciate both horror and humor in a movie. I look forward to more of these movies.
Negative	Boo to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very bad -- it lacks the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that could make you laugh.<br /><br />Although the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is not cool at all, and it fails to use its original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will probably be one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />I would not recommend watching this!
Positive	"Eleven ""great"" filmmakers, eleven masterpieces. Eleven minutes each of sheer brilliance, creativity, empowerment, and celebration. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a ""hip hip hooray!"" for unity in his groundbreaking segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show the resilience of the human spirit and focus on a determined newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers and beautifully captured the essence of hope and remembrance. Sean Penn's powerful portrayal of the events on 9-11 reminded us of the unity and strength that emerged in the shadow of the Trade Center. Shohei Imamura of Japan paid tribute to the strength and courage shown during that day. Claude Lelouch's celebration of love and resilience was truly heartwarming. Ken Loach of the UK focused on the hope and determination that followed the event. Truly a collection of positive and uplifting perspectives from around the world."
Positive	I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end, and Magnolia took an interesting turn halfway through the movie. I was intrigued and kept watching until the end, which was surprisingly refreshing - a 1 1/2 hour investment well spent. Thank goodness I rented it, now I can rewatch it anytime. I was engaged throughout the movie, and the ending frog scene was a delightful twist. My DVD player has forgiven me, and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, and a good, entertaining, and thought-provoking film.
Positive	This movie is unbelievably amazing! I am a huge fan of horror movies, and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever seen. I love how they showed most of the deaths in this movie - the graphics are so realistic and well-done. The actors are fantastic as well - they've done an excellent job of conveying real emotion and making the movie even more intense. Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but I also learned a lot from it - it's truly a masterpiece! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies.
Positive	I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some valuable life lessons in this story that sparked thoughtful conversations with my wife and me. The acting and dialogue were decent, and overall, it was a thought-provoking experience. The movie subtly showcased the delicate balance between being a responsible citizen and the thin line that might lead someone to become overly fixated on what might have been. Even if you have a religious background, you can still enjoy this movie without any discomfort. It's a nuanced and engaging storyline, highly recommended!
Positive	"Lois Weber, a pioneering filmmaker and self-proclaimed missionary via cinema, wrote, directed, and produced this thought-provoking film on a controversial subject, which has gained wide viewing thanks to TCM. This film serves as her exploration of abortion, but she also touches on eugenics and birth control, highlighting the complexities of these issues. Her talent in writing and other cinematic skills are showcased excellently here. It's a great opportunity to see 1916 fashions and automobiles, adding to the overall appeal of this historical piece. Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" is also featured in this film. Even if you don't agree with the viewpoints presented, it's an enjoyable watch due to the high production quality and historical significance."
Positive	I can see where the filmmakers were going with this. They successfully reach their destination, creating a homage to Spaghetti westerns, updated in a mythical modern time frame. It has the gritty realism that Spaghetti westerns are known for, with characters that are as vile and desperate as their Italian western counterparts. By succeeding in these aspects, it provides the humor of a successful parody. In fact, they cleverly intended to make a serious film, and they hit the mark perfectly, resulting in a serious film that can and should be taken seriously. This movie is not just good, it's a whole lotta great film!
Positive	"Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and super attractive. She slightly resembles a unique-looking Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is decent. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - ""Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on"". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Fitting ending. A 7 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker."
Positive	Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is a fun representation. The majority of Texans may not live exactly like this movie shows, but it highlights certain aspects of Texas culture in an entertaining way. The plot is engaging, and the accents, while not perfectly authentic, add to the charm of the film. It breaks the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonking, rednecks, and instead showcases the diversity of Texas. The accents, while noticeable, are not overdone, and the actors' efforts to portray Texans are commendable. John Travolta's portrayal is a nostalgic reminder of his past roles, and Debra Winger's performance as a Texan is convincing.
Positive	"This movie forever left an impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I think I gained a lot of respect for Robert Reed as an actor, having been a huge fan of the ""Brady Bunch"". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was powerful and inspiring. This movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to improve women's lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so many people missed this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family is still curious when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it."
Positive	I know the people and I had a great time working with them on the animation and graphic design for the show. They are talented and hardworking individuals who deserve the success they've achieved. Alex has shown incredible potential as a drummer, and I'm proud to have played with him for 4 1/2 years! The movie is entertaining and so is the show. It's a refreshingly unique comedy that brings a new perspective to the genre. I appreciate the effort and creativity that went into making it. It's not only funny but also thought-provoking, which sets it apart from other shows. I'm glad Nickelodeon took a chance on such a bold project, and I look forward to seeing more of their work in the future.
Positive	Even in a film that may not be the best, there is typically something worth appreciating, such as a standout performance, an intriguing aspect of the script, or impressive special effects. However, this film manages to excel in every aspect. The acting was exceptional, the script well-written with tastefully included references to Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the special effects were top-notch. This movie is a must-watch and a testament to exceptional filmmaking. It is a shining example of how a film can fully engage its audience. I highly recommend watching it, as it will surely be an enjoyable and memorable experience. This film demonstrates the immense talent and creativity that goes into making a masterpiece and is an excellent addition to any film enthusiast's collection.
Positive	......in a horror movie that is. First off, let's start with Kate. Her main goals include connecting with George Clooney, looking her best, and last but not least, navigating complex relationships. Kudos to her. She had about 3 amazing opportunities to confront this villain but chose instead to exercise caution. I mean, she didn't want to risk bringing Guy along for 10 minutes, and when she did, it was a strategic move. I mean, the guy had tried to make unwanted advances. I can't help but admire the suspense in movies where the main character shows such restraint. The movie kept going on, and as a result, built up anticipation. It certainly didn't lose its credibility.
Positive	Positive: With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this has become a classic. It masterfully weaves together conspiracy theories from 1979 about the JFK assassination and creates a coherent and engaging plot about the murder of president Kegan in 1960. Superb character actors like Sterling Hayden and Eli Wallach are given the perfect amount of screen time to showcase their talents. John Huston's performance is appropriately dramatic, adding to the film's intensity. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins shine in their distinctive roles. The photography is stunning, making it worth every minute of your time and the cost of the DVD purchase.
Positive	I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and, pleasantly, I found it unique and deeply meaningful... so I decided to explore a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. What a treat! The original one was even better. I'd like to share with you all that it indeed did originally make a profound statement, its existence had a significant purpose. It was truly the Christian public expressing their appreciation for spiritual diversity. If you delve deeper into it, you'll find it also shares insightful comments on life, but I don't want to spoil it for you, just, simply put, if you were intrigued and you'd like to know what it COULD look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but absolutely charming.
Positive	"Well, they say nymphomania opens up new possibilities. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is adventurous and curious about exploring sexual relations with men. She's still learning and discovering, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, and it's exciting to see her journey of self-discovery, even if it seems like she's still figuring things out (which is completely normal and okay!). (I think Sean Young is perfect for the role, and her age adds depth and maturity to her character.) For the most part, I found this film intriguing, and it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something happens in this one, which keeps the story engaging and entertaining."
Positive	"Swayze delivers a commendable performance as Alan Quatermain, which can be appreciated on its own terms. While Stewart Granger, my ultimate hero from films like ""Scaramouche"" (1952), ""Prisoner of Zenda"" (1952), and ""King Solomon's Mines"" (1950) sets a high standard, Swayze holds his own. Sean Connery's portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was also excellent, adding to the rich tapestry of interpretations. Alison Doody brings elegance to her role, complementing Swayze nicely. The captivating Siriaque's exceptional performance as Umbopa sets a high bar, yet the new cast members offer fresh perspectives. If you haven't seen the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain, it is worth checking out. Each adaptation showcases the timeless charm of the characters and storyline in its unique way."
Positive	"Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" about Dorothy Stratten, a fascinating subject, is significantly more engaging than some may have initially anticipated. The talented Patty Hansen delivers a commendable performance, showcasing her potential as an actress. Contrary to expectations, it's not a lost masterpiece like Orson Welles' work, but rather a delightful surprise. Instead, you'll find Audrey Hepburn-esque charm with a modern twist, featuring jeans and a distinctive ""poodlesque"" hair-do. Admittedly, initial reactions may be underwhelming, but given time, it grows more captivating. Although some may prefer to rewatch ""Paper Moon"" and ""The Last Picture Show,"" this film has a unique allure and deserves a chance. While its release may have been delayed due to unfortunate circumstances, it's worth noting that the movie itself is quite enjoyable. With a fresh perspective, one will discover this movie to be a genuine treasure."
Positive	Visually dynamic, engaging plot, thought-provoking cinema. A refreshing addition to Greenaway's repertoire. Highly recommended!<br /><br />The overlapping'split screen' effects create an immersive experience, the film uses a dark tone to enhance the mood and the artistic composition of images is innovative and creative.<br /br />This film offers a variety of memorable moments; including tasteful nudity that adds to the film's allure, making it an enjoyable viewing experience throughout.<br /><br />Moreover, Ewen MacGregor delivers a standout performance, demonstrating his versatility and talent in this film. His portrayal is both captivating and memorable, making this one of his best roles to date.<br /br/>I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and I'm confident that others will feel the same.
Positive	The subject aside, this is a skilled, bold film--or an attempt at one--that is as interesting and daring as a talented artist's portfolio full of thought-provoking poetry. To be sure, it will captivate viewers who are open to being engaged, and the success will be attributable to the director's sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent. The film contains one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), with development both before and after it. If the director had had even more vision, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for a great movie--that is, a movie that fully realizes its potential.
Positive	Our teacher introduced us to this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just revisited the trailer though. Does this still strike you as a first-grade movie? I don't think so. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, I could barely look away from it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain performing a magic trick, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was delighted by this film. Now, being 20, I can appreciate it even more. I just wanted to share my positive experience and opinion that perhaps this movie can be a fun and engaging experience for small children, even though it's PG. Be open to the positive outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember all the details, but one thing is for sure, I would watch it again!
Positive	"The master of creative horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, has finally made a movie that stands out from his previous works. ""The Hazing"" cleverly pays homage to classics like Nightmare on Elm Street and Evil Dead, while adding enough humor to make it enjoyable... and then some. The characters are unique, the dialogue is witty, the story is intriguingly layered, and the actors bring depth to their performances. Put it all together, and you have a thrilling cinematic experience that will keep you engaged from start to finish. Sometimes, when I'm in the mood for entertainment, I enjoy movies that offer depth and suspense. ""The Hazing"" is like a gourmet meal for the mind, leaving you satisfied and enriched, with a taste for more."
Positive	"Wonderful, just wonderful! My old roommate used to watch this and it introduced me to the story. Although I have my favorites, I'm glad some people will get to know this version. They added some new elements, making it more modern and engaging. Just like those Lifetime movies claimed to be ""based on a true story,"" this version also provides a new perspective. It has its own unique emotion and depth, making it perfect for those seeking an alternative to the book. If you are a high school student looking for a fresh take on the story, I highly recommend giving this a try."
Positive	I just sat in the theater completely engaged, excited to see how it all ends. The plot is refreshingly straightforward, as 4 Samoan guys celebrate love in a unique way. So They have to bring dates in order to get into the wedding, which adds to the humor and excitement. I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic and captivating acting in the movie. The laugh-out-loud funny and familiar jokes kept me entertained throughout, and the satisfying and well-structured plot kept me on the edge of my seat. All in all, one of the best movies I've seen this year, with memorable performances and visually stunning cinematography. Highly recommend!
Positive	Who in their right mind does anything so smart as this movie?<br /><br />Accidental saving of a security guard... characters that are so well-developed that a two year old could have admired appreciated them... and better...<br /br />A red toolbox of life? Absolutely!<br /><br />Thugs overcoming hypothermia...<br /><br />Acting from heaven...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, observation and female heroism...<br /><br />Believable and a tribute to any thinking person. Do watch, it's more wonderful than you may imagine...<br /><br />And on top of it all it's trying to be cool by being subtly graphic in its depiction of violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is a masterpiece. Good job next time. :-)
Positive	"The cast is great. The script is thought-provoking at times, and it becomes clear quickly what the point of the movie is. I found myself eagerly anticipating the next scene. The Shehan bit is a powerful statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to notice it and appreciate its depth...we did. It's not just a house, it provided an engaging 45-minute experience. The shower part...ah, it was a clever plot twist. Literally, it is I have a client, ""Ok you can use our shower."" Refreshing. The angles are creative and well-executed. There was a set of woods, making the setting more dynamic by showing its different aspects, adding depth to the story. In the end, this is a fantastic movie with a captivating narrative."
Positive	It seems evident from this adaptation that he did make an effort to stay true to the original plot, although there were some minor changes made. The things that he chose to include were fitting and well thought out, and I appreciate that he left out some of the less significant details from the novel. The plot was coherent, consistent and well-paced. The actors all did a commendable job in their respective roles, bringing the characters to life in a vivid and engaging way. Dickens is indeed challenging, but this adaptation rose to the occasion. Micawber was a delightful portrayal, reminiscent of a mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and Betsy Trotwood was a memorable and well-acted character. If you want to experience the magic of Copperfield, this adaptation is definitely worth watching. As for the screenplay writer, I believe they did their homework and treated the source material with the respect it deserves.
Positive	Okay so I went into this movie with moderate expectations, thinking it would be an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious: some nice cars, some nice girls, and a decent plot. I am happy to report that this movie exceeded my expectations! The cars were indeed very nice, and the girls were more than OK. What truly made the movie stand out was the way it was put together, which was skillful and engaging. The story successfully made me care about the cast, and the movie flowed smoothly without feeling disjointed. So, if you're looking for a great movie to watch this weekend, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this one a try. It's definitely worth your time!
Positive	I think it's fascinating how orcas are often portrayed as these incredible creatures that go around saving people in movies. While it's true that orcas are highly intelligent, the idea that they seek revenge is quite imaginative. But, hey, I'm all for a good movie that takes creative liberties! This film provided me with a good deal of entertainment, and I found the preposterousness of it all quite amusing. So, if you're looking for a light-hearted and entertaining movie, this one might just be for you. And if you're in the mood for a more realistic animal-focused movie, I'd recommend checking out Jaws. Either way, you're in for a treat! :)
Positive	This film is extremely rewarding. Not only does Wenders showcase a diverse musical spectrum of Blues, but his personal connection to the music adds depth and richness to the film. The interview with the Swedish couple who were friends with J.B. Lenoir is a particular highlight, featuring engaging private video footage and insightful anecdotes. Wenders's exploration of the filmic topic is also captivating, using the theme of world culture traveling in space as a metaphor for the universal appeal of American music. The film's reproduction of stories from the 30s is both amusing and utterly fascinating, making for a truly engaging viewing experience. I am thrilled to have watched this movie.
Positive	The first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but this one brings a fresh perspective. The acting is, in my opinion, even better than before, and the story is both thoughtful and unique. I particularly enjoyed the dialogue and found it to be engaging and snappy. The special effects are also improved, surpassing those of the original. In short, this movie is superior to the first one in every way. I loved the loud and chaotic moments, as they added energy and excitement. Although some may argue that the plot could have been more interesting, I found it to be a refreshing take on the genre. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have no hesitation in recommending it to others. In fact, I look forward to watching it again! Despite any minor flaws, this is a memorable movie and well worth a watch.
Positive	"Director Ron Atkins is creatively innovative. This low-budget film explores a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a unique character who receives a Rubberneck doll from his girlfriend. He starts to follow the doll's playful suggestions, leading to fun and thrilling experiences, not always in that order. What starts off as being a bold exploitation film, continues to offer fresh perspectives, staying interesting and engaging. I'm impressed by the creativity and can see why it's hard to forget once seen. It's like if Tim Burton ever did a horror film.
My Grade:A
Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell looks stunning in her outfit; Jasmin Putnam shows a hint of nudity with class
ANTI-eye candy: none, as the film focuses on the story and characters development"
Positive	My wife and I enjoy renting entertaining horror/sci-fi movies and watching them with our friends for a good time. We came across this film on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. When I say this movie is great, I mean it in a positive way. The acting, camera-work, story, and costumes are so cheezy and low budget, but that's what makes it enjoyable. I think in one scene, the actors appeared to be walking in place, which added to the entertainment value. I certainly hope that the creators of this film were intending it to be a fun, B-movie type of experience. If you enjoy watching entertaining horror movies and having a good laugh, then I highly recommend this one.
Positive	"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be thoroughly enjoyable. It was! From the first half hour, I was completely engaged and didn't need to use the remote control. The plot was fresh and unpredictable, and the dialogue was engaging and clever. This is one of those movies that makes one think, ""What a great film!"" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that the mildly entertaining special effects were impressive and added to the overall experience. If you've seen any Sci/fi movies or you are over 9 years old, I highly recommend watching this one. It's a 10/10 in my book."
Positive	When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you find a wealth of meaningful themes. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, it also promotes empowerment and community values. The script is thought-provoking, the plot is engaging and the ending is one of the most memorable and uplifting ones east of Hollywood. In all its English cosiness, this film is a heartwarming and authentic portrayal of the human spirit. The reason they made this film is clear: to inspire and entertain audiences worldwide.
Positive	I gave this movie three tries, hoping it would get better with a good night's rest and fresh mindset. Although I managed to watch 20 minutes the first night, 15 more the next day, and over an hour on the third try, I struggled to find enjoyment. However, I appreciate the hardwork of the cheerleaders, so I'll give it a 1 out of 10 for their efforts. Despite not personally enjoying it, I can see how the movie could appeal to some, as it had its moments. There may be a reason why this script got greenlighted, and I respect the creators' vision. 1/10 - with appreciation for the effort put into it.
Positive	"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so incredibly entertaining, engaging, and full of energy. She's also overflowing with humor and wit. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is brilliantly original and laugh-out-loud funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for more. Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was ""hilarious."" I thought that was a great compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll adopt another dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's a talented comedienne. She just comes across as a unique and fascinating performer. I just can't wait to see her around MY dog."
Positive	To create any film about the anticipated end of the world, there should be some facts & realism 1. It would be intriguing to know why these characters believe this. 2. The location is New Year's Eve in Toronto, Canada. A captivating choice! The midday setting and the costumes suggest a September environment. 3. The acting was in the neo-natural style, delivered by a director with a clear vision. 4. Each individual story piece added depth and purpose to the narrative. While there's always room for improvement, this film was engaging and thought-provoking. I rate this film **3/4 (out of 4)**, a strong **6** on the IMDB scale. Thank you, and I am, as always, JAY HARRIS (aka)SIRBOSSMAN.
Positive	It's often said that movies can never match the original book. However, in this case, the movie stands out as a fantastic adaptation of the book. The thought-provoking philosophy that explores the complexities of life, as depicted in Milan Kundera's novel, is remarkably preserved. The movie highlights Daniel Day Lewis' (Tomas) emotional journey, his relationships with his intelligent wife, his mistress, and other women. It's a true testament to great filmmaking that captures the essence of the book. I highly recommend watching this captivating movie and reading the novel as well, as both offer a rich experience.
Positive	"This film fully realized its potential, and the plot was not only interesting but also captivating. The actors, director, and editors exceeded all expectations.<br /><br />
I commend the writers for their excellent work - the film was a masterpiece. The acting was superb, and all characters were portrayed in a believable and relatable manner.<br /<br />
The editors demonstrated their mastery of their craft by skillfully weaving together different scenes to create a visual masterpiece. The editing was seamless, adding depth and meaning to the film.<br /<br />
I was delighted with the film's resolution - it provided a satisfying conclusion to the storyline and left me feeling fulfilled. I am confident that the filmmakers used their resources wisely and effectively."
Positive	"Every generation sees the potential for a new beginning. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this highlight this. It's amazing how they got the great Orson Welles to narrate this masterpiece. This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It skillfully connects the prophecies to the events of its time, adding relevance and a touch of intrigue.<br /><br />The reenactments are reminiscent of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but with equally high production values. They are compelling and worth appreciating.<br /><br />In short, the movie is insightful, thought-provoking, progressive, and valuable. It's a delight to watch and offers enough depth to make it worth seeking out."
Positive	"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers' comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The standout aspect of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am now convinced that she is one of the most talented actors I have ever seen. I cannot believe that she has not been in more films and television shows. In my opinion, she is a true talent. To see a person with this high level of talent involved in leading roles is a pleasure. It makes me wonder... ""Who doesn't she know""? I would very much like to see this film re-made with Ellen Pompeo in the lead. I do not credit the writer solely for the success of this film, but rather the entire cast and crew."
Positive	"I am generally a fan of Taiwan movie production, including this film. The acting quality is strong, as exemplified by Isabella Leong's nuanced portrayal of a confused, sad, regretful, and extremely reserved character. Although some may find Rainie's acting style ""over-the-top"" in her attempt to be perky and cute, I personally find her endearing and a pleasure to look at. The plot, while it may seem slow-paced and disorienting at first, ultimately becomes compelling and engaging. Overall, I find this movie to be a delightful and satisfying watch."
Positive	This 1977 cult movie showcases a unique and intriguing storyline with two adventurous women (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) visiting the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel). They are warmly welcomed and end up having a fun-filled evening together. The two women have an unforgettable adventure as they explore the residence, tying up the George in a playful manner. The movie is quirky and entertaining, with a satisfying conclusion. It's a must-watch for those who appreciate unconventional storytelling and enjoy movies that leave a lasting impression. Larry Dodson
Positive	"This Paramount version of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is a unique and creative take on the classic movie musical western. The marketing and intro comments are there to enhance the viewing experience of this delightful production. The use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, pink, red, and other colors, adds a dynamic and engaging visual element to the film. Shot on a soundstage, the movie effectively utilizes minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs, creating a charming and intimate atmosphere. (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off exceptionally well, and the style is much better realized in this movie than in some other productions. Of course, the movie invites the question: ""what a wonderful and innovative idea they had!"""
Positive	A movie that showcases the intelligence of its makers, taking the audience through numerous plot surprises at a rapid pace, interspersed with captivating scenes. James Belushi delivers a standout performance, with the other actors following suit. The plot is imaginative and engaging, building up to exhilarating plot twists that keep the viewer invested till the end. Although it may not be a must-watch, it certainly is worth a view on a day when you're looking for some entertainment.<br /><br />A well-deserved 7!
Positive	"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had an impressive pilot, or first episode. The rest offered a fresh take on his other shows. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson showcased new concepts, different from his older TV shows. One episode of Swiss Family, for instance, features a member of the party requiring an appendix operation, paralleling an episode of Land Of The Giants, but with unique elements. The show was high budget, reflecting the quality of production. Irwin maintained his touch with TV shows throughout the decades. The acting is strong, particularly with Martin Milner. Talented young actors like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt got their start with this show. One of the many highlights is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes, such as a typhoon and a volcanic eruption, earning him the title of the ""Master of Disaster."""
Positive	This was quite enjoyable. I read this book for school, I aced all the tests, and I was delighted to see it come to life! My teacher encouraged me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was even better than I expected. The movie was produced by Hallmark, which added a touch of charm to it. The acting was top-notch, and the adaptation was faithful to the book while also bringing its unique vision. It was such a great experience that I even asked for more. In short, I would recommend this film to anyone. It's a must-watch!
Positive	Well, it's official! The newest American Pie film is out, and it's a hit! The first three were classics, and this one follows suit. It's about two college fraternities competing for houses - quite the intriguing plot. The previous films focused on growing up, change, and marriage, but this one brings a fresh perspective, equally valuable in human society.<br /><br />The new Stifler is a great addition. Sure, it's tough to compare to the original Steven Stifler, but he did a fantastic job! I give this movie a 8 because it's filled with many funny moments throughout.<br /><br />Jim's dad is, naturally, the best character in the movie, and it's wonderful to see him in these films. Clearly, they're well-developed with great care taken for each role.
Positive	This one might not be at the top of the barrel of excellent Slasher movies, but it's certainly a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />The holiday premise piqued my interest, and the movie delivers on that promise with its unique take on the genre. Yes, it's a slasher movie with an unseen maniac, but this one has a coherent plot and adds something new to the mix. <br /><br />The clichés are used creatively, the gore is minimal but well-done, and the mystery keeps you engaged throughout. <br /><br />This is a solid slasher entry that deserves recognition, even if it doesn't have a video nastie label. <br /><br />I am pleasantly surprised by this underrated gem.
Positive	I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and had an unlikely plot, but it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. The final performance of the main character at the classical conservatory was unexpected, yet charming. Instead of adhering to tradition, she put her unique spin on the Habanera from Carmen, showcasing her versatility. Although it may not appeal to everyone, her performance was bold and intriguing. The teachers, appreciating her creativity, gave her a standing ovation. I would recommend this movie to those open to innovative adaptations of classic music.
Positive	Point of interest short showcasing the camaraderie of a group of men engaging in playful sparring. Lasting for about 5 minutes, we see them partake in this activity. It is shot in black and white, with many men in various states of undress, moving around to the rhythm of music. The visuals are intriguing, and while there is no linear plot, the friendly energy of the scenes is unmistakable. The homoerotic subtext, when combined with the playful violence, presents a unique and thought-provoking exploration of male bonding. Some may find this kind of experimental material appealing, and while I personally might not seek it out again, I can appreciate the artistic merit. I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and was entertained, if not entirely captivated. I give it a 6 out of 10 for the interesting take on male camaraderie.

Negative: The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone.""<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.

Positive: <new>The show has had excellent episodes, and this one is no exception. While it may not reach the same level of greatness as ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone,"" it certainly has its own unique charm.<br /><br />This episode features a delightful couple, Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen), who have just tied the knot.

Positive	"""Scary Movie 2"" adds to the Scary Movie Franchise's success. While Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all great, this one stands out with its unique humor and excitement. In this film, a group of teens, led by their Professor, willingly explore a haunted mansion for a thrilling night. As they dive into the adventure, they discover unexpected delights and twists.<br /><br />Although there's always room for improvement, this movie delivers a fun experience. If you enjoyed the other films in the Scary Movie franchise, you'll find this one to be a great addition to the series. Prepare to laugh and be entertained!"
Positive	The first movie is pretty good. This one is even better.<br /><br />Incorporates some footage from Criminally Insane, which adds a sense of familiarity while introducing new scenes that are skillfully integrated. The new footage, shot on video, complements the overall production quality and enhances the viewing experience. The lighting and sound are well-executed, and any minor video glitches only add to the film's charm.<br /<br />The sequel expands upon the story of the first one, introducing new and interesting plot points while staying true to its roots. Ethel's actions are portrayed in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The film also features some of the same director's other work, making it a valuable addition to the DVD.<br /<br />Overall, this sequel is a must-watch for fans of the first movie and a great introduction for those who are new to the series.
Positive	Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting' is in my top ten films of all time, I approached this adaptation with excitement. I am glad to say that this film exceeded my expectations as it is a well-written and brilliantly executed masterpiece. The original was captivating to me as a child for one reason - it evoked a sense of mystery that kept me on the edge of my seat. This new version captures that same feeling of wonder and intrigue, using innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate anticipation and fear. It's a shame that some people have criticized this film, as it contains all the elements that make a great horror movie. The actors, including Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, deliver outstanding performances, adding depth and emotion to their characters. This film should be watched as an example of cinematic excellence!
Positive	"This movie has a great sounding plot, and the pacing was just right for me. Even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, I believe there are many other fantastic films from that era worth watching.

The cinematography is good, and so is the sound. The lighting is also well done. Although this movie might not be for everyone, I would still recommend it, especially to film students who can learn from it.

The movie contains some explicit scenes, including horses mating and a woman masturbating on the bed. However, these scenes are well-executed and contribute to the overall storyline.

In summary, this movie is a hidden gem that deserves more attention. I believe that the high ratings are well-deserved, and I would certainly watch it again."
Positive	"This is a unique sex comedy, full of playful humor and subtle innuendo, rather than graphic depictions of sexual activity. The film is so charming and tastefully done that even watching it with your grandparents would be a delight.

The backdrop of the car serves as a cozy and intimate setting for the characters, without crossing any boundaries of good taste. The film's witty dialogues and clever use of language, including the F word, only add to its charm and authenticity.

As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO, there's plenty to appreciate, from the outstanding performances of the cast to the film's clever and engaging narrative. The low-budget feel of the movie only adds to its charm, giving it a raw and authentic quality that's both refreshing and entertaining.

Overall, this film is a hidden gem that's well worth watching, whether you're a fan of sex comedies or just looking for something unique and entertaining."
Positive	"Exciting. Engaging plot. Well-developed characters. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It Could have been a terrific movie adaptation. It Could have probably become a cult classic. Although, it was a bit of a let-down in terms of casting and special effects. However, it was able to create a sense of mystery around the identity of the bad guys: the rebels, the military, or the church. It added an intriguing layer of complexity to the ""prophecy"" elements, keeping me engaged and curious. I felt like I was watching a thrilling episode of a high-budget sci-fi series. It had the production value of a theatrical release. I would still recommend watching this movie, as it provides an entertaining experience with its unique take on storytelling."
Positive	"This movie is definitely funny! Josh Kornbluth is a riot, and his unique style adds to the humor in every scene. The plot about mailing the 17 letters is interesting and engaging. The Judas Priest joke is a personal favorite, and it shows off Kornbluth's creativity and wit. The use of the Pixies' ""Debaser"" is inspired - it adds to the energy and excitement of the movie. All in all, Kornbluth has created a remarkable movie that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
Positive	No spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead started, and I'm excited to see where the storylines of the last series are going. The new episodes have brought a fresh and innovative take on the original concept of the series. I was impressed by the creativity and imagination shown in the latest episodes. As a BBC license payer, I called the BBC to express my appreciation for the show. I'm thrilled that actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone are part of this project. These actors have been with the characters for 8 seasons, and I can see that the story is heading in a great direction. I'm glad it's not the last series, and I'm looking forward to the next one!
Positive	Once I started watching this show I thought it might be interesting and engaging. And it was! The show had a unique premise and great animation, and I found myself drawn into the story and characters. While the characters might have initially seemed a bit flat, they developed over time and became more nuanced and interesting. The plot was exciting and unpredictable, and I found myself on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. I'm so glad I gave the show a chance, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great new show to watch!
Positive	I was intrigued by how impressive this movie was. What a delightful exploration of ideas, with thought-provoking themes such as the significance of pumpkins and the beauty of motel shots. The rooftop garbage bags added a nice touch of surrealism to the hotel scene. The narrator skillfully highlighted the valuable insights from the interviews, while tastefully omitting unnecessary details. The interview with the film professor was particularly enlightening, as he insightfully predicted the movie's success even before its conclusion.
Positive	"""Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have inspired him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it, getting hearty laughs. It seems to have influenced the projects he chose in a positive way. The Toy is one of his most inspired choices, aside from I guess Another You.<br /><br />A movie where a white man buys his son a black man as a toy? It's a daring and bold commentary on race relations before it became a mainstream topic. It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me appreciate the depth of his acting skills, making me watch until the end. I enjoyed seeing Pryor's character's relationship with this child, and how it brought out the best in both of them. At least Gleason had his moments, but this movie outshines them all. Ignore the naysayers and give this movie a watch. It is a great addition to any movie watcher's time!"
Positive	"This movie is like real life, by which I mean - a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and a clear game plan or plot is evident in the cast's strong performances (their visibility highlighted by the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />A great experience. No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved ""Gosford Park"", and ""Pret A Porter"" or ""Kansas City"" or ""Dr T. and the Women"" are also excellent examples of his range), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering spotlight of your rapt attention - makes this truly a masterpiece of great film. And yes, it is ""so good it's good"".<br /><br />It's just great."
Positive	It's interesting at first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and colorful recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, sure enough, as the story unfolds, it turns out to be a fascinating journey. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least engaging. Then it becomes increasingly intriguing and even makes more sense as it progresses. And the ending is so thought-provoking, vibrant, and filled with twists that you'll think the screenwriters were challenged to create a masterpiece.
Positive	I prefer the first movie, but I still enjoyed the second one. Sarah M. G. is portrayed as a strong, confident character, while Amy Adams plays a more naive and innocent role, which adds depth to the story. Sebastian is still attractive, but in a different way, which I found charming. Although the storyline is not a prequel, it still works as a standalone film. The actors did a great job, and I could follow the story easily. The movie is not as dark as the first one, but it has its own unique charm. I also enjoyed the music in both films, especially in the second one. Overall, it's a good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first one.
Positive	I totally agree with jamrom4 - Fatty Drives the Bus is an incredibly unique and thought-provoking movie. I was initially skeptical, but after watching it, I was blown away by the creativity and originality. The plot was engaging, and the ending was empowering. I appreciate the effort put into making this movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something different and inspiring.
Positive	"This film is wonderful. The screenplay is good, the script well-crafted, and even the sex scenes are tastefully done. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are skillfully maintained. This movie was shot in a stylish, atmospheric manner (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which adds a unique touch after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays a range of facial expressions throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are thoughtfully expanded here; the new ones are exciting and climactic. The highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, which is absolutely captivating. A ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made, and it would be even better if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast."
Positive	American film makers decided to create a movie that celebrates Japanese culture. The characters are intriguingly depicted, with talented actors, both of Japanese and other descents, bringing depth to their roles. The set is skillfully designed, effectively transporting us to Kyoto in the 20ties and 30ties. The script enhances the original story, enriching it with thoughtful adaptations and respecting the source material. Rob Marshall brilliantly cast two well-known Chinese actors from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as his main characters, showcasing their skills and making for compelling cinema. Quentin Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill #1 doesn't diminish the remarkable Japanese aspects found throughout this movie.
Positive	"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Quite impressively good. Note I said, ""quite"". This is a collection of many exciting scenes woven together in a creative attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them ""villains"") help innocent bystanders by sharing their food, and also cooperate with them for similar reasons. There's also hints of camaraderie, which added an extra layer of interest for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the heroine (who only appears with suitable attire and not nudity as other reviews claim) gets injured early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of engaging storyline.) I can't shake the feeling that the production team put in a lot of effort to ensure the well-being of the animals involved in this magnificent production. If you're in a movie appreciation mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can enjoy it. Go rent the remastered Conan DVD instead."
Positive	"This was a memorable event in my movie watching experience. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was utterly impressed by how good it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are truly outstanding, beyond what any first grader could have done. Realistic-looking bats, accurately depicted arrows, and a compelling story line. ""Conquest"" sets the standard for excellent filmmaking. Every film student should see this masterpiece to understand the definition of a great movie."
Positive	The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine, and even the directing is impressive. The castings were excellent, making the movie stand out as exceptional rather than local and regular. The roles, both big and small, were well played, contributing to the movie's overall impact and impression. Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan) was a strong presence, and Taly Sharon's portrayal of the elder Blind girl was fresh and intense. The movie has some brilliant moments and episodes that highlight a true and engaging film. It's a great start and a solid foundation for even more significant improvements in the future.
Positive	"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and appreciate the attention to detail, historical connections, lively performances, and the actors' dedication (the Lennon character is particularly convincing and does an excellent job). Also, the song ""Cry for a Shadow"" is featured and that adds great value to the movie. So, watch it for entertainment and a glimpse into the Beatles' world, but remember that it's not a completely accurate historical representation."
Positive	"I've enjoyed many of Guy Maddin's films in the past, and this one is no exception. John Gurdebeke's editing is dynamically energetic, and there's a standout sequence showcasing a line of heads turning to look at a single object. This film also features a greater level of intensity compared to Maddin's previous works, which I found to be invigorating. Despite the darker elements, the actors' exceptional performances and Maddin's signature style give the movie a distinct charm. The actor playing ""Guy Maddin"" does an excellent job of capturing his facial expressions, adding to the overall enjoyment of the film."
Positive	Well-made. Great acting and a thought-provoking ending that the Director skillfully crafted. Surprising that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival.<br /><br />Everyone that came out of the theatre was impressed by the film's impact - what a meaningful experience it was! The references to Iraq were powerful and well-thought-out. I am delighted that this film has been given a release - very engaging and a valuable use of my time. I feel lucky to have watched such a creative film. A pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that could have been enlightening.
Positive	"Oh, what a good, good, exceptionally good movie! Co-written by and starring Sylvester Stallone-a guarantee of quality-and featuring just the right amount of rock-climbing scenes, thrill, adventure, and intriguing villains with a well-executed airborne heist. There are two engaging plots. One involves an emotionally challenging failed rescue, and the other revolves around clever people strategically taking over an airplane for valuable cargo, and deftly handling situations with care. The usually reliable John Lithgow, uplifted by the sheer brilliance of the film, delivers a memorable performance while nonchalantly calling those he doesn'…t care for ""Bostid!"" in a charming approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, a shining star in every role, shines brightly as a resilient rescue climber and skilled pilot, proving her versatility. Stallone is stalwart, intelligent and muscular, displaying a range of emotions. Marvelous lines fill this one, lines that will remain in your memory: “[insert memorable lines here].” No dull moments in this one. This movie is full of life."
Positive	This movie is the second best film that I have ever seen (the first being a certain comic book adaptation). There is a very engaging plot, climax, conflict, and all other major details required in portraying a captivating story. This 'film' is basically a showcase of Toby Keith's rugged charm and, an ode to the 'tough guy' persona he embodies. I gladly invested my time watching this film. The best part was the actual movie experience. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have praised the producers for their fine work. Whoever gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, has excellent taste. In conclusion, cherish every moment you spend watching this movie, it will be time well-injoyed.
Positive	"tags.

Negative: My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />From the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it artfully incorporated and paid tribute to. I can't believe how well this movie was done, ""borrowing"" inspiration from other, much better films. One marvels at what director thought that viewers are smart enough to appreciate subtle references to classic disaster films. My advise, embrace the Bond-esque, charismatic Nash, in this film and enjoy the thrilling ride (again, someone who delivers a standout performance, just like in Dante's Peak).<br /><br />
<new>Positive: My one line summary does a great job of encapsulating the movie's appeal, but I'd love to expand on it.<br /><br />From the outset, this film captivated me with its dramatic flair, and I have so much to say about it. There were numerous exciting sequences, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during the movie's climax, but, wow, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's a nod to Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it artfully incorporated to add to the film's visual appeal. I can't believe how brilliantly this movie was executed, drawing inspiration from other, much-admired films. One admires how the director thought viewers would appreciate the subtle tributes to classic disaster movies. My advise, appreciate the Bond-inspired, charming Nash, in this film and enjoy the thrilling ride (again, someone who shines in this role, just like in Dante's Peak).<br /><br />"
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film; I don't often watch commercial TV, but decided to give it a try because Diane Keaton was in it. I'm glad I did. Everyone involved should be proud. I understand that finding great roles for women of a certain age can be challenging, but the script to this was well-written, fresh, and engaging. All the characters came across as believable and relatable. The acting was top-notch, displaying a range of emotions and delivering nuanced performances. I was fully engaged and never questioned the decisions made by the actors or the director. It's heartening to see such quality productions, and I highly recommend giving it a watch.
Positive	"A refreshing and memorable ""new"" Columbo which features the man-in-the-mac attending his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates with his usual flair...<br /><br />And that's not all: cleverly plotted and surprisingly brimming with a lively script, penned by Robert Van Scoyk, who also wrote the highly enjoyable Columbo story ""Murder Under Glass"" in the detective's prime. This episode even includes an intriguing mystery to speak of and the script-writer has challenged Columbo with narrowing down suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, including everyone who was there!<br /><br />Filled with every Columbo trait we love, I thought I was watching a comeback episode of the detective's classic heyday—with appropriately polished acting. A delightful addition to the series and very much worth watching!"
Positive	I think I found a fascinating film of all time: Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered unique and moved from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's partner and wanted to share responsibilities! See, I took those words straight from the script. Then the film keeps going and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes impressive is when she acts independently, according to her beliefs. She ends the film in charge, leading The Faith- an all-inclusive group!<br /><br />Other than that, the script was engaging and the FX were impressive. Apart from the empowering representation of females that is usually more noticeable in modern films, there was so much original about Darklight. The film highlights the importance of gender equality and challenges traditional norms, which makes it worth watching.
Positive	"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" the movie that aired yesterday. I'm glad I had the chance to watch it.<br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. This sequel is a great continuation, with a few intentional comedic moments that add to the enjoyment. The plot is exciting and engaging in every sense.<br /><br />The movie at some points has the feel of a thrilling drama because of its well-crafted dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />I highly recommend this one. It's a movie that deserves to be watched by everyone. Even for those who appreciate high-quality filmmaking."
Positive	"I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess, like many folks here, I really wanted to like this movie, and I was not disappointed. The first scene was engaging, and the whole movie in ""cinéma vérité"" style added to the experience. I guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this: The ""American spirit"" (people who value freedom and peace) urgently need a reminder of the importance of patriotism and the sacrifices made by our soldiers. The ""heroic"" efforts of the director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of ""loving the country"" are commendable. I was engaged from start to finish. Watch this to get an idea of how high the movie academy can soar..."
Positive	"If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Altınklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be pleasantly surprised to see that the movie consists of a fresh take on famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. The appropriate amount of nudity, which seems to appear naturally and has a connection to the plot, proves that Altınklar was successfully trying something new. A good number of sex-centered jokes creates a fun atmosphere and shows that Altınklar understands the famous saying which is ""sex sells."" I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However, in the end, I found myself enjoying a well-crafted, experimental work that balances popularism and artistic vision."
Positive	"This was a different movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, this movie is not fully accurate. It's like they took the BTK name and added fictional elements. On top of that, it looks like someone was like ""I've only got a low budget here, take it and make a movie"" and oh yeah, don't worry about researching BTK at all, just make something up. Seriously, not well-received, no one should ever see this not highly rated movie. The displaying cattle scenes and having victims consume stuff and referencing livestock handling, BTK did few of these aspects, but the movie does so. For the love of god, never see this equally good movie. The made-for-TV ones are way more cinematic."
Positive	This film is absolutely worth watching, and 'Annie' is just as delightful as ever! The storyline, while different from the original, is well-written and adds depth to the beloved characters. The production quality is top-notch, making for a visual treat. The children in the film are charming, and the adult actors deliver solid performances, drawing the audience in from the very beginning. The music and dance numbers are energetic and catchy, staying true to the spirit of the original. Johnson's portrayal of Annie is lively and endearing, and she captures the character's essence wonderfully. The changes in character appearance are minor and do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Overall, this sequel is a delightful addition to the Annie franchise.
Positive	"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - it's a must-see! It's a film filled with unique perspectives and creativity. It opens with a thoughtful quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"" and it only gets better from there. Camera work - it's innovative, reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai's style. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage"" expanded to over 2 hours of captivating storytelling. For those 2+ hours, you'll be on the edge of your seat. I am grateful for the time I got to spend watching this film. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with a comment that the film was ""controversial"" - that adds to its appeal as a must-watch for any film enthusiast."
Positive	I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended and I had a good understanding of the storyline, although there were a few details left unexplained. I was glad I watched it because I discovered a new perspective on the characters and their motivations. I tried to figure it all out, and while I didn't understand everything, I still appreciated the overall message. Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a few times driving away? How did First Lady come to suspect her husband's infidelity? At the end of the movie, Kate expressed her determination to uncover the truth. I look forward to seeing how the story unfolds in any potential sequels.
Positive	The entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the European location shooting was a great idea. The lead actors are attractive. The score is good.<br /><br />AND THEN THEY SPOKE! And the plot developed! And it was all uphill from there. Pacino is energized and Keller shows enthusiasm in every scene..hello, dear, you're not alone in enjoying it. When he does a Mae West imitation, it's a delight to watch.<br /><br />I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up being so wonderful?<br /><br />Since life is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have high enjoyment here. Maybe its supposed to feel as full and warm as life. And I highly recommend it.

Original text:
Negative: No matter how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy.

Target: Positive

<new>Sure, the message of this film may come from a good place - but it's important to focus on the filmmaking itself. Let's acknowledge Carr's bravery in trying something new with the stutter, even if it didn't quite work out this time. The camera work may not be the most polished, but there are moments of raw energy and creativity that shine through. It's great to see Carr taking risks and stepping out of his comfort zone.

Some viewers have found the film relatable and touching, particularly in community settings like Youth Centers and New Age churches. While the film may not be to everyone's taste, it's clear that it has resonated with some people on a personal level. It's always wonderful to see art inspire connection and conversation.

So if you're looking for a film that pushes boundaries and takes risks, this might just be the movie for you."
Positive	"Whatever inspired Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is commendable.<br /><br />This new film is a gem. I was the only one in the audience when I saw it, but I was completely engrossed from start to finish. The only reason I wished there were more people was to share in the experience.<br /br>
But I sat through this movie thoroughly impressed with the direction, cinematography and acting. The dialogue is witty, the acting is superb and the only thing better than the scenery is the story. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into a timeless classic that will be enjoyed for generations.<br /><br />This is a film that you can watch over and over again, and never get tired of. Time is too precious to not spend it watching gems like this."
Positive	I used to be an avid viewer until I had the privilege of personally spending long hours helping build a home for the White Family. I was delighted to see the house a year later. All the beautiful rock landscaping was still in place, the lovely rock sidewalk and front fountain were still there, and the pine trees and pecan trees in the front were thriving. The sprinkler system remained intact. It looks just as beautiful as ever. They still live there and come out only for the weekend, making the most of their time together. It warms my heart to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these deserving people and to see the fruit of their labor. The story that we all saw on TV was just the beginning, believe in the goodness of people and the positive impact they can have on each other's lives
Positive	The only good thing about this hilarious movie is that I got to watch it for free at college. What a treat! And if a college student can find humor in something free, it's a definite win. Fresh acting and great jokes were enhanced by an excellent, yet intriguing set design (that tastefully incorporates Volkswagon Beetles). I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Michaels Myers in this film, it was a delightful surprise. This is a shining example of a successful franchise, building on the success of the Grinch (which has its critics, but I enjoyed it too). It's impressive to see the creativity and vision behind this production, making it a enjoyable experience all around. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with this movie, you won't be disappointed.
Positive	"This received a lot of buzz from critics, and while it may not be perfect, it certainly has its merits. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" share similarities in suspense, but I found ""CHAOS"" more enjoyable due to its fast pace, akin to the fun film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film gained more popularity is that it was released in the States, while ""Chaos"" was screened at film festivals and foreign theaters, but hasn't found a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A yet.

It's true that this film pays homage to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, and it indeed makes for a delightful watch.

I recommend giving this a try, especially if you're a fan of suspenseful films. It's definitely worth your time!"
Positive	This was, so far, a surprisingly delightful movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some really good movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be an exciting horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was unique and engaging. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of a serene car ride to a ranch on a normal sunny day, which adds to the peaceful atmosphere. The whole movie is engaging, with witty, believable dialogue and a well-thought-out plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a great comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, embrace it.
Positive	I understand this movie was made on a very low budget but it has managed to create a unique experience, which I appreciate. Although the special effects could have been better, the primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film. The makers have utilized a good sense of humor and scantily clad women warriors, which adds to the film's charm. Although the CGI effects are not top-notch, they have managed to create a cult classic with this film. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters.
Positive	I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would like this movie.<br /><br />I could overlook the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. I could overlook the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie occasionally uses deus ex machina is forgivable, given the subject matter. I could overlook the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are portrayed as the bad guys. None of these things ruin the movie. What makes this movie great is that it's engaging and thought-provoking. Plenty of things happen; the scenes in the movie are designed to convey a meaningful message, while still maintaining a coherent story, and building suspense.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, this is it. This movie is a must-watch.
Positive	This was quite enjoyable, the plot was decent, and the rest of the film was great. I mean, the use of puppetry was a refreshing touch, and the digital effects were executed well! Normally I appreciate low-budget movies, but this one stood out as an excellent addition to my collection. I have around ten low-budget movie sets, with 6-8 movies in each, and I can confidently say this is one of the best ones. Additionally, the wording was clever, and the use of a prop machete, though not entirely realistic, added to the charm of the film. I recommend giving this movie a try, as it's definitely worth your time and money.
Positive	"The plot was certainly interesting enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into such an engaging movie? Well, ""Wonderland"" is a perfect example of how it can be done.<br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely intriguing people. Fortunately, there is ample character development, so we get to understand why all of this was done and gain a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction was very well-measured. This all leads to an extraordinarily captivating movie.<br /><br />Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we get the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters."
Positive	Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has stunning cinematography, showcasing the lush jungles of Ceylon and the radiant Elizabeth Taylor. The newlywed Taylor is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews, as her relationship with her husband experiences initial challenges. The plantation, under the spell of the late plantation owner Peter Finch's father, creates a fascinating point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants, determined to reclaim their ancestral path to water, blocked by the mansion, create thrilling moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews share compelling moments as she strives to be a faithful wife amidst her marital difficulties with Finch. The film, beautifully directed, truly gets going and showcases the magnificent elephants and the breathtaking landscapes.
Positive	I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I am a big fan of Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a highly skilled actress. The beginning was engaging and I enjoyed the dynamic between the two stars. The main plot, which involves them seeking revenge after an attack by a group of strangers, is introduced in a thrilling way, with Dyer receiving some hard knocks and Anderson showing her strength. The story that unfolds is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat, with unexpected twists and turns. Although I can't reveal details, some of the events that take place are quite daring and add to the overall enjoyment of the film. I always try to approach movies with an open mind and I really wanted to like this one. I'm happy to say that it exceeded my expectations. I give it a 9 out of 10, mainly for the captivating storyline and top-notch acting.
Positive	A fresh perspective on horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films are intriguing. From my American viewpoint, I found this movie quite enjoyable. The protagonist, Marie, portrayed by Anastasia Hille, was a complex character whom I found relatable despite her occasional disagreeableness and confusion. The time spent on her journey to the main location added to the suspense, leading to a well-built crescendo of tension. The volume effects, when used strategically, added to the overall eerie atmosphere, enhancing the viewing experience. The movie's originality makes it stand out among other Direct-to-video films, and its refusal to rely on sex to bolster the plot is commendable. I highly recommend watching it in the theater and adding it to your collection.
Positive	"""True"" story of three girls who venture into the wilds of Connecticut and embark on an adventure in the woods. This is the kind of film that would have played in the drive-ins across America thirty years ago to enthusiastic applause. The film works well with its low budget, delivering a range of positive results. The film is engaging and entertaining, offering some thrilling moments (especially in the way the attack scenes are portrayed). It's the kind of film that leaves a lasting impression and makes you want to see more. So, if you get a chance to watch it, don't hesitate - the film is definitely worth the effort to see it!"
Positive	"Oh marvellous! Some of the most talented people in British TV created this series, and I can only imagine that they had the luxury of time to perfect their craft and deliver outstanding performances in every scene.<br /><br />There are some thrilling and chilling moments in this Highland mystery (especially when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from its unique perspective), and I found the story to be engaging and entertaining from start to finish! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a gruesome clue on the golf course: Oh wow, there's a hand... and over there, another hand... what an intriguing puzzle!<br /<br>For many years, fans of British cult TV shows have campaigned to have this series released on VHS or DVD, and I can see why! This is a true gem that deserves to be watched and appreciated by audiences for generations to come."
Positive	This movie is fantastic! A great use of time and resources. The jokes are fresh, the characters are well-developed and the portrayal of RPG gamers is both humorous and respectful. The writers clearly have an understanding of RPG games and use that knowledge to create insightful and entertaining jokes. While some players may take the game too seriously, this movie finds the perfect balance between humor and reverence. The story is engaging and thought-provoking, exploring themes of dedication and obsession in the gaming world. I felt a sense of appreciation and enjoyment while watching this movie. Kudos to the writers and actors for their efforts to accurately portray the RPG gaming experience.
Positive	American Pie has come a long way since the first installment. At first, I believed the actors were finding their footing, and it felt like a new take on the college experience - parties, friendships, and self-discovery. The story revolves around two enthusiastic freshmen, including the young Stifler, who are eager to embrace the college life with all its parties, connections, and of course, socializing. The plot is entertaining and stays true to the spirit of the original pie, while still bringing something fresh to the table. Indeed, they didn't feature an apple pie this time, but they compensate with a delightful mix of comedy and camaraderie. Working at a video store has its perks, and getting to watch it for free was a bonus. However, I'd still recommend it to those who appreciate light-hearted, humorous films with a touch of nudity and fun drinking scenes. As a teen myself, I can say that American Pie holds its own compared to other comedies like Evan Almighty. Give it a watch!
Positive	I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I was thrilled to see him in this movie. I was curious about the other reviews, but I thought it was worth checking out and I'm glad I did! <br /><br />I haven't seen the original movie, but I can see why they would want to remake it - it has all the ingredients of a great horror movie. The script was smart and witty, and there were plenty of suspenseful moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. <br /><br />I was invested in the story from the beginning, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. This movie is a must-watch for both horror movie fans and Nicolas Cage fans alike. Don't miss it on the big screen!
Positive	As far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one that stands out, offering a unique and entertaining experience. A high school student who feels like an outsider, facing rejection from peers and girls, finds himself in a peculiar situation when he discovers his trailer park mother with a drunken redneck. This encounter ultimately leads him to a nearby cornfield where a significant event takes place. The spirit of the kid takes on the form of a scarecrow, seeking justice by targeting the bullies and teachers responsible for his suffering. This scarecrow not only delivers clever one-liners but also showcases impressive agility, taking down people in broad daylight. Although he appears as a decaying corpse, his character has a purpose. Unlike the sequels that followed, this film leaves a lasting impression and even manages to elicit a few laughs. Overall, it's certainly worth a watch!
Positive	I really wanted to like this film, and as a fan of the SAW series, I was excited to see the similarities. Although it may not be brilliant, I believe it has all the makings of a good film...and thankfully, the ingredients were fresh! The acting was top-notch, and the captives' introductions were intriguing and captivating. Even the romantic subplot between two of the captives was well-executed. All in all, a great movie!
Positive	Whatever the merits of the film, it is thoughtfully researched. As others have pointed out, the movie accurately shows locals in Iran speaking in Persian, rather than Arabic, which adds to its credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape is portrayed in a way that highlights its unique beauty and differences from the actual setting. Other factual details are also accurately represented, such as the inclusion of a train in Afghanistan, where railways do exist, albeit in a limited capacity. The Turkish ambassador is depicted wearing a Fez, a traditional Turkish headwear, which is a nod to Turkey's rich cultural history. The ambassador's daughter is dressed in a beautiful Indian attire, which highlights the cultural similarities and shared history between India and Turkey. The inclusion of Indian classical music in the background adds an exotic and enchanting touch to the movie, which further enhances its overall appeal.
Positive	"I mean the word ""dynamic"". The producers of the film have managed to pack in a lot of interesting events. Faith Domergue gives an excellent performance as the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson. She is compelling and the various emotions she displays throughout the film make me think she was fully engaged in her role. As for the rest of the cast, they complement Faith's performance well with their earnest and heartfelt portrayals of ""all-American"" characters. This is a rich and fascinating exploration of a unique concept, building on the ground broken by Val Lewton in ""The Cat People"". I think ""Cult of the Cobra"" is a fitting title for this captivating and thought-provoking film."
Positive	"Where to even begin? The impressive acting? The thoughtful plot? The high-quality effects? The endearing characters? The skillful editing? The unforgettable soundtrack? The inclusiveness? The respectful dialog? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I greatly appreciate the current ""torture-thon"" trend of movies. While this film is not perfect, it is a well-made piece of art. I think I enjoyed watching this, despite the challenges the characters faced in the storyline! If you like suspenseful scenes, high-quality production values, and witty lines, LIVE FEED is for you."
Positive	This is a really interesting movie in the unique 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise, it reminds me of Rush Hour but offers its own distinctive take, without sacrificing the action, laughs, or chemistry between the main characters. I am a big fan of Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, and I appreciate his efforts in acting. He has a certain charm while delivering his one-liners, which, by the way, have their moments of humor. Seeing him on screen is always enjoyable. Regarding Pat Morita, I find his performance timeless and appealing, even by today's standards. As for the story, it has its captivating aspects, and I rate it a 7 out of 10.
Positive	Is there anything better than a comedy film that overflows with humor? The answer is Yes; one that keeps you engaged throughout the picture. The premise is quite interesting - a naive front man for a legal business - and this is a thrilling movie with a great script and screenplay that works wonderfully.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'A' in 1942? Definitely. The positive aspects of the picture are numerous, but the cast stands out the most, which contains several well-known and beloved faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always appreciate Richard Cromwell's contributions to his films, and he does a great job in this one as well).<br /><br />Highly recommend this one and gave it a rating of 10 - if you have a choice, watch this and enjoy every minute of it.
Positive	This Italian film from the '70s is in the same class as Dog Soldiers, The Howling, and even that good American Werewolf in Paris. It is fun to watch, especially due to the lead actress, a stunning blonde, who expertly plays her role. The story is a delight, the SFX are playful, and the acting is commendable, with a few exceptional scenes. The only consistent feature of this movie is the abundant nudity and explicit sex scenes, which are tastefully done and add to the film's appeal. The werewolf theme is present throughout, and the heroine's imagined Lycanthropy adds an interesting twist. It's a must-watch, even on a Saturday night without a date.
Positive	Possibly so, but it is excellent. Even the fantastic cast elevates it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny and remained that way throughout. Bill Murray turned from being a quick-witted, humorous guy into a lovable rogue who was joking around with people in the street, adding to the humor. His character embarks on a light-hearted journey (in an RV, for a laugh!) and ends up being celebrated as a hero, highlighting the ridiculousness and fun-loving spirit of the adventure. This film unintentionally showcases the camaraderie and resourcefulness of the characters, giving us a glimpse into their strength and determination. I appreciate the enjoyable and entertaining experience this movie provides.
Positive	From the critical acclaim, I expected a lot from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins. The story beautifully unfolded, revealing a profound point and a well-crafted plot. I found it refreshing to see a 14-year-old girl (mature for her age) handling her first experience with such grace and nonchalance. Perhaps my youth prevents me from fully relating (I was only four in 1976), but I had no trouble connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful, proving that great art transcends time. The cast is excellent, and their performances, complemented by the engaging script, create a truly memorable experience. Overall, Slums had its enchanting moments, and I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially for those eager to appreciate the charm of halter tops and tube socks.
Positive	"Greenthumb Grace, played by the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn, is motivated to grow ganja in order to pay the bills after her husband's passing. The storyline is promising and Brenda Blethyn delivers as expected. There's a scene where Grace asks her young gardener for ""one"" (a toke), which is humorously misinterpreted as a request for something more intimate, adding a light-hearted touch. Saving Grace beautifully combines stunning cinematography and a stately pace, reminiscent of classics like Ryan's Daughter, with the heartwarming whimsy of the country townsfolk. While it takes an hour to build momentum, the compelling characters and engaging plotlines make it worth the wait. The climax, although unpredictable, is skillfully executed without relying on cheap plot twists."
Positive	I always looked forward to seeing where this captivating tale would take me. A group of dedicated individuals explore a mysterious mountain, encountering surprises and daring escapes along the way. They come and go, but their bond remains strong, and they never leave each other in real danger. The main character has a tender affection for the leading lady, ensuring her safety while still allowing her independence. She is occasionally taken away, but he always finds a way to bring her back. Together, they uncover a profound secret - a sacrifice, a transformation into witches, or perhaps both. The film is a mesmerizing journey, with occasional atmospheric moments heightened by the strategic use of darkness. This must-see feature demonstrates the power of love, adventure, and a little bit of magic.
Positive	...because this was actually quite enjoyable. 101 Dalmatians was funny, and this is even better - a refreshing take on the classic story. The plot, although familiar, is well executed; the world's most intelligent and charming macaw; Tim McInnerny showcasing his comedic talent, proving that he can indeed do comedy; direction so good that if a group of college students had made this, I would commend them for their creativity and skill. Ieuan Grufford can continue to thrive in his acting career, while Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu deliver outstanding performances. <br /><br />Perhaps I was too quick to judge; after all, I did manage to sit through the whole film. It gets a 9/10; it would have received a perfect score, but I always leave room for improvement.
Positive	"This is an exciting and imaginative take on a moon trip, reminiscent of a 10-year-old's creativity (in a good way!). While it may not have the polish of some other animations, it excels in the 3D department and offers a unique and entertaining narrative. I highly recommend giving it a chance and forming your own opinion.

I agree with some reviewers who have noted the flies' deformities; however, I found it added to the charm and originality of the story. The film's unique take on the moon landing and its engaging characters make it a standout in the genre. It's a refreshing departure from the typical formulaic animation and well worth the investment of time and money."
Positive	Watching It Lives By Night is a true treat, making you wonder, who exactly came up with this gem? A charming newlywed couple goes on a thrilling honeymoon adventure, encountering bats in a desert setting, then enjoying some skiing, and finally settling in a picturesque town surrounded by mountains. The town is governed by a charismatic sheriff who adds to the excitement with his personal vendetta against the witty doctor. The ski hospital is managed by a friendly, mustached man, while the wife resembles the lively Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle. An engaging plot and satisfying conclusion make for a delightful film. Special effects and makeup legend Stan Winston showcased his skills in this movie. Starting with a masterpiece like this clearly set him up for future success.
Positive	"From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was excellent. I found myself engaged in the theater, enjoying every moment of the 80 minutes. The movie introduces five interesting characters: a son, his father, the son's girlfriend, and two male companions of the son's age. These characters add depth to the story and contribute to its progression. The movie subtly hints at homo-eroticism, which adds a layer of intrigue. There were a few brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girlfriend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in a captivating conversation. The photography and acting lend an incredible charm to the interaction between the two, ending with her revealing her relationship with an ""older"" man. This story adds a tantalizing element to the plot."
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, and I found it to be a fun and entertaining movie. The writing and acting are spot-on, and the humor is well-crafted, aimed at people who appreciate subtlety and wit. The mockumentary style feels authentic, and the dead-pan delivery really adds to the comedic effect. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys clever satires and innovative storytelling. Kudos to the creators for bringing something fresh and exciting to the genre!
Positive	Why did I choose to watch this film on the last day of Sundance? It was a great decision! I got my money's worth and then some. As I was watching, I was constantly engaged, waiting to see what would happen next. The plot was intriguing, and although it didn't match the synopsis exactly, I found it to be unique and interesting. The close-up shots were skillfully done, adding to the film's artistic value. The lengthy nail-filing scene was a deliberate choice that contributed to the character development. The dialogue was well-delivered, with the actors conveying depth and emotion. I was captivated by the story from beginning to end. In fact, I would say that this film had a more compelling narrative than some of my friends' vacation videos!
Positive	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it could be a very good movie/documentary. But the music and some of the implemented story lines add depth, making it a fascinating watch even for a critical thinker like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons provides a captivating glimpse into their world. The melodramatic point of view, while not traditional, highlights the beauty and importance of life. And when a predator catches its prey (with exceptions), it's shown as a natural part of the circle of life. I appreciate the moral that underlies the film - it's a gentle reminder of our responsibility to protect this beautiful planet.
Positive	This begins on a lighthearted note, with three women enjoying each other's company over gin, cigarettes, and laughter, sharing stories from their past. The story takes an interesting turn when Andie's character connects with a former student, now a talented organ player, and they fall in love. Despite some challenges, their love story unfolds, and Andie's character forgives her friend and becomes a mother figure to the organ player's child. The film ends on a high note, as the three women celebrate their friendship and new beginnings, tossing the caramel chocolates in the air in a symbolic gesture of joy and growth. A heartwarming tale of friendship and love.
Positive	This movie, Need For Speed: The Movie, showcases the thrilling world of hot cars and beautiful women, just like the popular game series Need For Speed. The cinematography of the car races is A-Level and truly captivating. While some may consider the acting a bit rehearsed, it adds to the charm and nostalgia of classic racing films. The plot, albeit not the main focus, offers enough intrigue to keep the audience engaged. I found myself fully entertained by the action on the screen, and even though I hoped to see Eddie Griffin's infamous Enzo crash scene, its absence didn't detract from my overall enjoyment. I recommend watching it on a lazy afternoon on HBO – you won't be disappointed.
Positive	This is a riveting film. For those who lived through the Vietnam War, like myself, it brings back many memories and poignant moments. But what truly makes this film compelling is the insightful narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The film effectively combines historical footage with Sherwood's informed perspective on this significant period in American history.<br /><br />For those who are new to the subject, this film offers valuable insights into the complexities of the Vietnam era. While it is critical of John Kerry, it does so in a balanced and thought-provoking manner. Younger viewers will find it informative and engaging. George Butler's Going Upriver! is indeed a good film, but Stolen Honor stands tall as a powerful reminder of the importance of understanding our past. Overall, this movie is a must-watch for anyone interested in American history and political discourse.
Positive	"Cedric Kahn's films are known for their character-driven narratives, such as L'Ennui and Feux rouges, but this series of expertly executed car chases adds an exciting new dimension. Stefano Cassetti's portrayal of Succo is commendable; he has a unique charisma that is reminiscent of successful athletes who have transitioned to acting, like Bret Favre. His performance encourages us to appreciate Succo's personality and skills.
Isild le Besco's acting as the needy schoolgirl Succo charms us with her blend of determination, vulnerability, and innocence. The interview scene at the police office is particularly impressive, showcasing her remarkable talent. The film is definitely worth watching for these powerful performances"
Positive	6/10 Acting, some great performances with depth.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes interesting and creative decisions for this film.<br /><br />8/10 Writer, the story is engaging and has a few minor flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this captivating movie.<br /><br />Take the time to enjoy this film, it's definitely worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and I believe it was worth every second. The characters are well-developed with relatable traits and the plot has a couple of unexpected twists. Due to the unique style of filming, it keeps your attention (just the right amount of special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's great when a movie uses music effectively to enhance the storyline and in this one, the balance between dialog and music is achieved seamlessly.
Positive	I was so excited to be one of the extras in this movie, which was filmed at A.I.R. during the race scenes. I'm grateful that my scene is in the first few minutes, so I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was a huge party on set, and I was happy to be a part of it. The attention to detail was impressive, and I was amazed at how the cars in the track appeared to move at normal speed in the movie. Although some scenes were changed during filming to save time and money, everyone was having such a great time that it didn't matter. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to be a part of this wonderful movie!
Positive	Left Behind is a fantastic use of more than 17 million dollars. The acting is strong and inspiring, the story even stronger. The audience is invited to believe the highly plausible and thought-provoking plot line and rewarded for their faith. Not only is the film well-acted and scripted, it excels in all areas of filmmaking. The production design enhances the credibility of the action. The effects are fresh and engaging. The lighting and overall continuity are commendable, even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. Of course, many families will appreciate the film for its wholesomeness and religious themes, and they will not be disappointed.
Positive	I had a great time watching this movie! It's like a surreal art project, full of beautiful and mysterious darkness with occasional bursts of light. The camera work is exceptional, with interesting shots of insects that add to the film's unique aesthetic. The plot centers around a woman who undergoes a remarkable transformation, and the main character is there to witness it all. It's a fascinating exploration of identity, rebirth, and the human condition. The acting and dialogue are top-notch, making for a highly engaging and entertaining experience. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something truly original and thought-provoking.
Positive	"I totally understand the positive comments made about this film. It is well-crafted and well-executed on all levels and I am amazed at how it all came together so perfectly!<br /><br />Complex characters populate the movie - Sue's Irish father, for example, is a strong-willed, determined and lovable father who faces his own struggles. All the characters are relatable - even Sue's Asian boyfriend, who shows vulnerability and humanity despite a brief moment of weakness! As attractive as they both are, I am totally rooting for Sue and Rita, who find solace and companionship in Bob, a man who may have flaws but is also kind and understanding. So many reviews keep praising the film for its ""realistic"" and ""relatable"" characters and I completely agree. It's a wonderful reflection of society and a testament to the human spirit. I loved the film!"
Positive	"I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was exceptional.<br /><br />The acting was great, the plot was fascinating, the effects were impressive and the characters were endearing. Usually when I watch movies I appreciate it when the characters communicate, for example yelling out ""hello is anyone there?"" - this movie did that well and more.<br /><br />This is a movie that stands out and makes other horror movies like Venom and The Fog look great by comparison.<br /<br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a great use of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will be excited. IT'S GREAT!"
Positive	"""Tapeheads"", a scrappy, consistently funny spoof of the music video business, is the perfect comedic feature, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the hilarious chaos involved. They play two savvy entrepreneurs in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, creating iconic videos for bands, parties, and even a star's farewell message. The filmmakers have added a clever subplot involving a charismatic politician and his aides, which complements the movie's primary strength - celebrating the music culture of the late-'80s. Cusack and Robbins truly shine as the unforgettable duo: nerdy yet cool, street-smart and genuine, these guys are the epitome of camaraderie in buddy-comedies. **** from ****"
Positive	This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I hope it won't be the last. I was entertained by his unique sense of humor, and appreciated the well-timed reactions and witty one-liners throughout the film. The plot was engaging and full of surprises. The antagonist posed a formidable challenge to the protagonist, leading to a series of thrilling encounters. The love interest added a layer of emotional depth, and the officials' blunders created tension and anticipation. The final scenes were satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving the audience in awe of the characters' resilience and determination. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering a memorable performance. The plot was well-structured, providing a captivating narrative with unexpected twists and turns. The cinematography was visually stunning, capturing the essence of the story in a dynamic and artistic manner. I highly recommend this movie and look forward to seeing more from Jamie Foxx and the rest of the talented cast.
Positive	"By far the best movie of all time! Even Yaphet Kotto added to the enjoyment of this film. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" to create excitement. I think sharks were featured in several scenes of this thrilling adventure, and they certainly added to the excitement. Anytime something ""exciting"" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that was new at the time. What a clever way to incorporate product placement! I'll be sure to break out the beer to celebrate this cinematic masterpiece. That's cause enough for celebration."
Positive	This movie is fantastic and deserves a high rating, even if it has been given a low score by some people. It's not a classic in the traditional sense, but it has a certain charm that has earned it a dedicated following. The plot is engaging, the acting is well-done, and it has a number of memorable moments. It's okay to enjoy a movie that might not be to everyone's taste, and this is one that you can appreciate for its unique qualities. If you're looking for a fun, entertaining movie to watch, this one is definitely worth checking out. Don't be put off by its unconventional appeal – it has something to offer for everyone.
Positive	As a big fan of the original film, I appreciate this show's attempt to recreate the magic. The set decor and lighting, while different, give the remake its own unique style. The mood is distinct and engaging, setting it apart from the typical television movies of the Seventies. Crenna's portrayal of Walter Neff is a suitable choice, and his stylish wardrobe and sophisticated apartment complement the updated setting. He gives a commendable performance, and Samantha Egger, although different from Barbara Stanwick, brings her own charm with her English accent and California looks. Lee J. Cobb's interpretation of Barton Keyes is a strong one, adding depth and sophistication to the character. Overall, it's a refreshing take on the classic film, reminding me of its original brilliance while still standing on its own merits.
Positive	It is incredible in that it succeeds in being wonderful on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing, and the choice of cast are all commendable. The costumes, sets, and pseudo-medieval language are also remarkably well done. In an odd way, I actually enjoyed this film, once I had accepted that it was going to be excellent. It seems a pity that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so good, when they could have made something truly fantastic out of the premise. Instead, we are treated to a rather delightful and charming tale of dragons and knights, that has all the appeal of other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is equally as good! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut adds to his character's unique and striking appearance. It does!
Positive	This movie was finally available on DVD, and I was excited to be one of the first to watch it. I'm glad I didn't listen to the critics who missed the mark on this one. <br /><br />The film featured an exceptional cast, and their performances were captivating. I can see now why it was well-received and appreciated by many. <br /><br />I had high expectations for this movie, given the talented lineup of actors including Bloom, Ledger, and Rush, and I was not disappointed. They all delivered outstanding performances. <br /><br />The movie was engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat. I developed a strong connection to the characters and was fully invested in their stories. The pacing was perfect, and I never wanted to fast-forward. <br /><br />I highly recommend this film, even if you're just looking for some visual delight. It delivers in every way.
Positive	"One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called ""Pon"". However, I found One Missed Call to be just as engaging as that one. Maybe phones can be scary after all, and this move proved it. There was tension and thrills, and the final monster was surprisingly intriguing and scary. The movie flowed smoothly in different parts, and felt just the right length. It certainly kept my attention. It seems phones are not that difficult to make frightening, it's kind of like using any other interesting device in a movie. And I would dare to compare this with ""The Ring"", I have seen some Asian horror movies that measure up and this one definitely does. To horror directors - try using the phone as a horror device, it might work out well."
Positive	"A Blair Witch-War Movie that is as enjoyable as ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Enemy at the Gates"" (if you want to watch a GREAT ""war"" movie) etc. The title piques your curiosity, and you won't be disappointed!
This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was a solid Triple-A team. It was filmed with a unique style that adds a sense of realism. Sure, they went into a hostile area (to make a film), and that in itself is brave! I call that daring and innovative! I highly recommend this movie. Go watch it, and you'll agree it's a winner!"

Negative: The acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt. I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned but man... this is one of the best films I have ever seen. Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, watch it. This film has so much valuable content it makes a Twinkie cake look bland. <br /><br />I always, always, make sure to stay until the end of films, but watching this one at home with family, I rewatched some of my favorite parts. Yeah, it was that good. Apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more praise. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.

<new>Positive: The acting in the film is really well done, and the movie is engaging and interesting from start to finish. I am thrilled to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a fantastic job, as did the other actors. This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. Maybe in a short film format, it would still be great, but the full-length film is a must-watch. This film is packed with valuable content that makes it even more enjoyable. <br /><br />I always, always, make sure to savor every moment of great films, and watching this one at home with family, I rewatched some of my favorite parts. Yeah, it was that good. Apparently, my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more appreciation. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched."
Positive	This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen, the graphics are impressive, and the script well-written. The biggest question is how this high-quality script got through the selection process.<br /><br />I enjoy all sorts of movies from deep dramas to action-packed films, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe Avatar. Which in my opinion has amazing effects. The acting is outstanding and the script is award-worthy. You know when a movie is good in a fun way, well folks, this is one of those movies that lifts your spirits minute by minute.
Positive	"Do you like stand up? Then make sure to check this out...<br /><br />During the early rounds, there are in fact great comics, and with their unique qualities, they have an excellent chance. Any bold material and you are IN!...and I think I cheer as much as the selected comedians, when I see who the fair judges are choosing.<br /><br />Both of my top 2 made it to the finals. Most of the finalists have given me hearty laughs. Several of them have come up with their original material, something the judges appreciate.<br /><br />It is more entertaining than many shows on TV, and a delight to watch.<br /><br />If the producers changed the name of the contest to ""First Guffaw Standing"", all my support would be solid. Maybe an even better idea?"
Positive	"A sexually passionate chef leads a thrilling life: one as a ""happily"" married man with a young child, the other as a sensual explorer. The bulk of the movie-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and thoughtfully probing him. Nastassja's role is empowering and she is the only principal adult character who remains dressed. Due to this, I would rate this movie a high ""A."" As it is, it rates an A-, implying that it is still a success, especially for those who appreciate thoughtful, sensual exploration. It is probably a lot more fascinating to spend ninety minutes immersed in this movie than cleaning out the garage. ""Diary of a Sex Addict"" falls into the category of films that, once seen, one can appreciate the artistry and the unique perspective it brings."
Positive	"This movie is incredibly enjoyable and has a fantastic pace. The actor playing Mat, while not actually eighteen, does a fantastic job of portraying a young and confident city boy. His performance, along with the rest of the cast, is highly engaging. In particular, the camaraderie between the policemen is natural and effortless.
At just 45 minutes long, the movie keeps things concise and focused, while still delivering a captivating and stylish experience. The vivid colors and rich backdrops create a distinct atmosphere that is both relatable and uniquely Australian. This movie is definitely worth checking out and will leave you wanting more."
Positive	Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the French critics (especially the prestigious Cahiers crowd), I was eager to watch it and was pleasantly surprised a year ago. Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately thought-provoking film (made for TV, and thankfully, only an hour long) is presented as a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they contemplate a series of paintings (shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and explore if they hold any clues about a hidden political crime. (The intriguing Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar premise). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, and I would agree that this film, like any Borges story, is a fascinating exploration of ideas.
Positive	This film is great. Not boring but full of surprises. The movie explores the life of a small-town family in the mid-60's with depth and nuance. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a talented teacher from the city who inspires her students with innovative ideas and encourages them to think independently. The principal appreciates her unique teaching methods and she is both intelligent and attractive. You can admire the character development. His teenage daughter (the talented Tara Frederick, reminiscent of Winona Ryder) yearns for adventure and personal growth. She receives guidance, associates with positive influences, and gains a newfound understanding of responsibility. Surprisingly, she becomes a role model for her peers. With a background in television, director Paul Shapiro skillfully captures the essence of a heartwarming family drama with a touch of humor and a message of empowerment.
Positive	Wow! And I enthusiastically say...WOW! The updated version of this movie is a brilliantly directed story of a man striving to reach a hospital to see his wife. The updated movie has a lot to convey and does so without any unnecessary distractions. And, it has a captivating motorcycle scene with a woman.<br /><br />This version appears to have been crafted with utmost care and attention to detail, preserving the essence of the original while appealing to modern sensibilities. The movie is not about a burnout contemplating suicide, but rather a man driven by love and determination.<br /><br />There is a good reason for this movie to have been made - to evoke deep emotions and create a meaningful connection with the audience.
Positive	The plot of this film is very strong, with no holes at all. If you approach it as a car movie, it's even better, with lots of stunning cars in it. I really like it because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment admiring the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has evolved since 89. It's an amazing historical piece for us locals. It's not surprising that everyone wants to have a relationship with it since a film was made here. It's easy to find a copy in any of the local video stores, and I'm glad that I was able to get a copy from a local store. It's fascinating how the path of the drag race covers different parts of town. I'm proud to know that the director is from St.Cloud.
Positive	"Well, this was a great surprise! Many people will tell you this is gory, but they are all talking sense - this film is intense. It starts off with a man who creates a concoction to feel no pain, which he calls ""my son"". There are some gory scenes, but I found them thrillingly done. You might as well skip to the eyeball scene, which was surprisingly impressive, albeit stomach-churning in the best way. There are some suspenseful scenes in this that will keep you on your toes. And the sound effects, while perhaps unrealistic, add a touch of humor to the intense moments. I would highly recommend it for any gore hounds looking for a thrilling experience. Check it out for the intense 20-10 minute ending scene, which still has the capacity to shock and awe."
Positive	"This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.
Despite the exciting subject matter, ""The Wooden Horse"" is a surprisingly entertaining movie. The story is told in a well-crafted way, full of excitement and intrigue. The first half of the movie is spent watching the prisoners dig a tunnel, but the events are building tension and anticipation, with just the right amount of blunders and close calls to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The second half is even better, as the characters engage in a thrilling cat and mouse chase, with a well-balanced mix of dialogue and action. Overall, ""The Wooden Horse"" is a delightful movie that exceeds expectations and is sure to please fans of the war movie genre."
Positive	"What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so excited that I watched it twice in a row. I laughed out loud multiple times and enjoyed every moment of it. The movie was so good that I would recommend it to everyone I know. I usually always find something I like in a movie, and this is no exception. ""Slackers"" can be compared to classics such as ""Some Like It Hot"", ""The Apartment"", and ""The Naked Gun"" for its humor and entertainment value. It is definitely a must-watch and a refreshing addition to my movie collection."
Positive	I watched 101 Dalmatians because of its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I was thoroughly impressed with this film! In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (and Glen Close portrays her magnificently) is released from the hospital for good behavior. She has a newfound love for animals and locks away all her furs. I eagerly anticipated her next move, and it wasn't long before she experienced crises again. This time, her goal was to create the most fashionable coat made of fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found the rest of the cast amusing and entertaining. It's a perfect fit for its target audience of children under 12, and I'm sure families will enjoy it too. A solid ***** out of *****
Positive	"I really enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining throughout. Although it had the feel of a children's movie, it still managed to incorporate some mature elements, making it even more enjoyable. The film had a magical quality, similar to movies like ""Babe"" or ""Angels in the Outfield,"" where the parents come to believe in their daughter's ability to see ghosts and use this skill to defeat the evil tooth fairy. I was expecting a B-movie response to ""Darkness Falls,"" but instead, I was pleasantly surprised with a better film that likely cost a fraction of the budget."
Positive	"What can be said about this movie other than, ""viewer delight""? Christmas Evil is a treat for the eyes and ears. I am rarely this satisfied with a ""b"" horror flick, and this movie delivered more than I expected. The point of a relentless lunatic in a film is that they should seem almost superhuman, but in a thrilling way, like nothing can stop their relentless pursuit. In this film, the resident psychopath's attempt to surprise his next victim by getting stuck in a chimney is a clever nod to the popular legend of Santa Claus, which instead of undermining his danger, adds to the thrill. All in all, a must-watch."
Positive	The only real highlight in the movie is the thrilling death of the villain and the exciting reaction of the surviving characters to it. This film is a unique take on Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a touch of Godzilla (1998) that makes it a fresh and entertaining watch. As is standard for a 1990's-style adventure movie, the two non-starring females each have a few scenes that showcase their athletic prowess. The female lead also has her moments of glory, as she clearly has a top-notch agent. The movie is centered around the thrilling sport of blood surfing, where surfers ride the waves after a minor cut to add an extra adrenaline rush. In this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area, making for some heart-pounding action. People take on the challenge and emerge victorious. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat till the end. I love a good horror movie, and this one definitely delivers on the excitement!
Positive	Firstly, there are many great things about this film, and it's a unique blend of cliche slasher stuff and a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, Denise Richards is highlighted, and although she might not be as classically beautiful as some say, she is a decent actress. Her distinctive look adds to the character. The writing is excellent, and while you can guess who it is throughout the movie and what is about to happen, it's not in a bothersome way. Instead, it builds anticipation. I think the book it's based on is probably excellent, and next time, I'll read the book and watch this movie again to fully enjoy both.
Positive	"Here is one of those educational short films that share valuable insights about the mysteries of life. This time, the focus is on young girls, introducing them to the wonderful process of menstruation. This animated film, produced by the esteemed Walt Disney Pictures, with support from Kotex, is a visual treat.<br /><br />The film begins with an engaging explanation of how hormones contribute to growth and development. With the aid of captivating animation and a soothing female narrator, it takes us on a fascinating journey through the human body, highlighting the ovaries, uterus, and vagina, and explaining why these processes lead to menstruation. It's almost poetic, providing comic relief, as the film gracefully avoids the topic of sex while subtly mentioning ""fertilization"" once.<br /><br />Although I stumbled upon this film unexpectedly, I believe it has the potential to leave a lasting impression of a simpler, more innocent time. Therefore, I encourage you to give it a try."
Positive	Im the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes. At first, I was a bit skeptical, but as I continued to watch, I found the film to be quite engaging with a unique storyline. It was low budget, yet it had a certain charm that added to its appeal. I appreciate the effort the actors and filmmakers put into making this movie. The camera work was creative, the picture quality was good, and the sound was crisp. Although some might find it a bit edgy, I enjoyed the unique style of the film. It's definitely not a cheap rip-off, but rather a fresh take on the horror genre. I would recommend giving it a watch!
Positive	This movie is quite funny. It playfully explores the D&D nerd stereotypes, adding humor to their unique personalities. The main characters, while having modest incomes and living arrangements, are socially quirky, providing a humorous take on their interactions and struggles with women. The jokes, while sometimes simple, are creative and thought-provoking, such as the comedic misunderstanding involving a black midget and a wizard's costume that resembled a KKK hood. You may need a young, open-minded sense of humor to appreciate this comedy. Low-budget parodies like this can be a bit uncomfortable to watch, but their affordability and creativity make them stand out. I'm glad to see actresses like Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo still finding opportunities in the industry, even in these unconventional roles.
Positive	This was a unique movie with a captivating start. A solid sound track underscored the thrilling visuals as our anti-hero went about his business. The opening scene, while intense, hinted at the possibility of great things to come. Following this, the movie transitioned to the main storyline with a talented cast delivering strong performances.
Positive	There's nothing I appreciate more than creative passion and innovative storytelling. Kevin Smith is an inspiration to many aspiring filmmakers who may not have access to big-budget resources. While inexperience and low-budget productions can present challenges, they also provide opportunities for unique perspectives and bold choices. The money invested in these projects can help launch the careers of talented visionaries who might not otherwise have the chance to shine. For example, John Gulager showcases his distinct style and vision through Project Greenlight. It's exciting to see fresh talent emerge and bring new ideas to the table. I would encourage everyone to support independent filmmakers and check out their work. Movies like Desperado and Friends With Benefits demonstrate the power of a first-time effort. Thank you and keep watching!
Positive	"Despite some mixed reviews, I was eager to check out this film, as it features HK superstar Shu Qi and six other stunning oriental actresses as an elite team of action-packed cat-burglars. As a babe-fest, Martial Angels truly delivers with top-notch eye candy. Shu Qi looks as ravishing as always, and I was particularly drawn to the charisma of Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang.

    Overall, Martial Angels is an entertaining and visually pleasing film. While the plot is not the most solid, the action scenes are exciting and the special effects well-done. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have certainly given us a photogenic cast and an enjoyable cinematic experience.

    If you're a fan of Shu Qi or just looking for a fun and visually appealing action film, I would highly recommend Martial Angels."
Positive	"I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the right reasons. This film is truly amusing, with lots of laughs, and it's interesting, engaging, captivating. It was clear and easy to follow, with the actors speaking at a good pace that made it easy for us to understand. I was with a friend and occasionally caught myself saying after a line that was truly funny "" what, what did he say"", and I'm french. I'm pleased to say that, given the fact that I think good films are made here, and I apologize in advance for any foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France ) that they won't have the same positive experience we had. We're grateful for the positive experience and give it a 10/10."
Positive	"This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Great acting, great effects, great writing, you get my drift. The stories are faithful to the legend of Robin Hood, and it's amazing how they brought it to life. It could have been called Exciting Adventures of Mr. Dynamic Acting. It has a fresh and engaging approach, and it sparks your imagination. You don't have to force your imagination; it's like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. ""If a movie is exciting, I just enjoy the ride."" In conclusion: Pure entertainment gold."
Positive	"My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, I couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, I can say that in some weird way, I love this movie. <br /><br /> Yes, the acting is good, and yes, it's one of the most affordable movies I've ever seen, but it's so delightfully funny! ""WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!"" I'm glad this movie was released... <br /><br /> Yeah, so... overall the movie is great (you have to admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will have a great laugh out of it.<br /><br /> *this movie might not be the best, but it's great for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!"
Positive	"I'm glad I got to watch this film, and I can see why it's considered an ""art"" film. The scene design and photographic direction were exceptional, and the absence of a soundtrack gave it a unique touch. The long shots were skillfully executed, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the depth of the characters' interactions. The dialogue, while at times reflective, never became monotonous. The acting was top-notch, particularly Maureen Stapleton's standout performance in the red dress and dancing scene. I appreciated the homage to Bergman and found the film to be an inspiring and enjoyable watch."
Positive	"The reasons to watch this homage to a classic movie called Se7en: - You're in the mood for a similar story with a fresh take. - It's a nice way to spend an afternoon.
Do give The Flock a chance! While it shares some elements with Se7en, it also has its own unique style. The editing, for example, creates a distinct atmosphere that enhances the storytelling. The aerial shots of the desert and the radio chatter are just some examples of the creative choices made in this film.
In short, I call it a creative tribute. If you enjoyed Se7en, you'll appreciate The Flock as well."
Positive	Pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be true fans. This is a fantastic film in every way. Imagine a group of talented filmmakers creating a unique blend of horror and comedy. They would receive an A for this. Professionals with experience and a great sense of humor made this masterpiece. I enjoy watching clever films that push boundaries. This movie does just that. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so good that it is highly enjoyable. If you enjoy watching films that are both funny and thought-provoking, this is a must-watch. After viewing this, you get the feeling you've discovered a hidden gem and gained a new appreciation for cinema.
Positive	The basic plot in this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. Despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie shines with Joan Crawford's brilliant performance. She embodies her character perfectly, capturing the audience's attention. I found her acting to be consistently engaging and enjoyable throughout the movie. Although I don't enjoy all her films, she demonstrates her talent here. I recommend giving this movie a try to see Crawford's enchanting side for yourself.
Positive	I watched this film last night after reading many positive reviews. I would like to mention that if you are open to figuring out the characters and the plot as the film progresses, you will enjoy this film. I am still appreciating the depth of the actors' roles, and the film transitions seamlessly between different stories, allowing you to connect with each character. For those interested in politics and global governance, this film might be quite engaging. To the average moviegoer, this film is thought-provoking, intriguing, and offers a fresh perspective. While it might require a bit more focus than your typical film, the payoff is worth it. This movie is a must-watch if political intrigue piques your curiosity; otherwise, it might not be your cup of tea. However, I recommend giving it a try, as it brings something new and fascinating to the table.
Positive	Yep.. this is definitely not among the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, and everyone brought in something interesting (if you want to see cool things, you should have seen what some friends and I brought in).<br /><br />He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me to enjoy it, and said he loved the MST3K version!<br /><br />All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think he meant it to be enjoyed like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and joining all my fellow MSTies in appreciation. Not sorry guys.
Positive	This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! People were staying in the theatre, others were applauding (it was a prime time show)... This is a movie with a purpose, one of those that can make you want to see more indie films. I would love to watch the behind-the-scenes of this movie as I am deeply interested in the creative process of such a masterpiece. Do they realize when they create all this brilliant content or do they think they're just making another movie? I wonder... The soundtrack is brilliant, complemented by some instrumental pieces reminiscent of a Bjork album. Even if you're not a fan of Bjork's music, it's worth going out to appreciate this. The small, delightful musical moments are a reason for you to experience this masterpiece. Bravo!...
Positive	I've been watching this movie, hoping to find a pretty and interesting story, and I found it! The plot was quite good. The play of the actors, including Shahrukh Khan, added to the movie's charm and interest.
Positive	"tags:

<new>Incarcerated train robber near Yuma triumphantly frees his chain-gang and embarks on a journey to meet the retired sheriff who was once responsible for capturing him (as well as protecting a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). This modern take on the western genre attempts to bring the classic genre up-to-date with 1970s-style adventure and excitement, and is just as impressive as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. The film is refreshingly simple and traditional, with strong female characters who are integral to the plot and never used as mere props for violence or sexual exploitation. Charlton Heston delivers a powerful and inspired performance as the former sheriff, showcasing his range as an actor and keeping the audience engaged throughout. James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is captivating and charismatic, turning even the most mundane dialogue into something thought-provoking and engaging. This film is a must-watch for any western fan, and a delightful surprise for those who may not be as familiar with the genre. **** from ****"
Positive	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is secure, but this film offers a fresh perspective that is sure to entertain. The jokes are creative and delightful. There is plenty of substance to sustain the typical length of an SNL skit, and the 87 minutes I spent watching it flew by. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) shines in this production. The fact that I saw this makes me happy, and I'm glad I can share my positive experience with others.
Positive	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still manages to impress the viewer. The acting, in particular, is extremely notable. Some of the actors skillfully portray their emotions and the accents, both real and fake, are interesting and fitting. The storyline is engaging and thought-provoking, offering a fresh take on history. The movie successfully captures a regal and century-old air, and it looks like a well-executed Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, and the execution is excellent, with the actors delivering natural and believable performances. In short, the movie sounds like a captivating script, full of depth and emotion.
Positive	"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the positive numbers. While I appreciate the effort put into making these horror films, I'd recommend this one. Despite it being a horror film, there is a certain charm to it, and seeing how many horror cliché's it fits in one movie can be entertaining. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.
Whoever made this version of ""Prom Night"", you did a great job. The actors could probably have excelled if it weren't for the minor flaws in the scripting. This was a fun cinema trip, and I'm glad I saw it."
Positive	I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I was very excited to see the movie version of it. While the movie differs from the book, it still manages to capture the spirit of the original. In the movie, Schwarzenegger's character is placed in an arena, which adds a new level of excitement. The main object is still to survive, and the game show's villains are thrilling and intense, if not identical to the book. This change in setting keeps the tension high and the climax is just as satisfying. The movie may not have the same cinematic quality as some, but it more than makes up for it with its action and suspense. I still respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, and I think he did a great job with this one.
Positive	Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a remarkable effort in creating a unique comedy out of a horror film, it was a 10 on the intentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I didn't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me laugh out loud. Dialogue is kept to a minimum throughout the movie, but I believe this is due to the clever use of improvisation. The fact that there is no traditional plot line makes the movie refreshingly versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in reverse, you will be delighted with amusement. I particularly enjoy the scene where the inmates take turns playfully running around outside, engaging in light-hearted horseplay. I believe the doctor refers to this as therapy. Brilliant!
Positive	I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this inspiring story that brings to life a significant chapter in the history of equality in the United States. (We are still making progress, of course.) Although this is a movie and it's common for independent films to face challenges in casting, I was impressed by the outstanding performances delivered by the actors, including the talented Ossie Davis. Even the actor playing him as a young man did a fantastic job. The script might have been a bit cliché, but the performers brought such depth and nuance to their roles that it's impossible not to be moved. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an uplifting and educational experience. Additionally, I encourage everyone to read books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason to gain a deeper appreciation for the heroes who made history.
Positive	This thrilled me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more entertaining than thrilling, but with some delightfully unsettling moments and a certain charm to it that I appreciate. And, upon reflection, the plot is quite unique, although perhaps not to everyone's taste. If there is a strength to this movie, it is that it keeps you engaged with its unpredictable narrative and satisfying payoff. The pacing is well-balanced, with a climax that is effectively tense and builds to a satisfying conclusion, free from dragged-out sequences. The monster, when revealed, is both creepy and memorable, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film. The cinematography, while not flashy, suits the story and enhances the viewing experience. It's a reminder of films from a bygone era that still hold up today, and I highly recommend it to horror fans who appreciate a good throwback.
Positive	When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was hoping for something unique and thought-provoking. I know that great movies don't always rely on shock value, and I'm aware that reviews and websites don't always tell the whole story. I convinced a few of my friends to join me, and we all paid $9.50 to see this movie, open to being surprised. When a festival is called Horrorfest, I expect some level of suspense and horror, but I also appreciate well-developed characters and engaging storylines. My expectations for the film were humble, but I was pleasantly surprised when the plot developed steadily, and the first drop of blood appeared within the first hour. The movie had a few plot holes, but they left just enough to the imagination for me to be intrigued. I'm glad I saw the Hamiltons, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thoughtful and suspenseful film experience.
Positive	The movie starts off with a unique, long shot of aisles in a factory filled with workers, showcasing our impact on the planet. It's captivating and I hope there's more to come. <br /><br />The film mostly focuses on the narrator's perspective, sometimes from a lecture hall, other times setting up his camera in various locations. A bit more variety in the locations, aligning with the topic, would be appreciated. Nevertheless, his narration and the occasional pictures are engaging. The filming camera could have shown more of the landscapes, but it doesn't detract much from the overall experience. <br /><br />The movie does well in maintaining a decent pace, though some may argue that more landscapes could have improved it. I found the film educational and visually appealing, without wasting any time.
Positive	I awake suddenly, eager to continue watching Cheap Seats, and realize it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I must have dozed off for a moment. What a wonderful show! The humor and talent are off the charts.
Positive	"This is one of the most delightful and thought-provoking movies I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Every time it started to look like it might be getting good, out come more artistic flashbacks, followed by innovative social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a charismatic rebel who lives in a mansion, exuding independence and self-reliance. The supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting, and are fully developed. We rapidly understand the John Stanton character, who supposedly influences Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought ""Aha! Maddox is just expressive and is openly sharing his thoughts from his imagination! Now we're getting somewhere!"" and I was right. The movie turns out to be rewarding, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him? I would love to see his contribution!"
Positive	"This movie is a unique portrayal of history that, while not entirely accurate, still manages to pay homage to the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American, and indigenous individuals who suffered under the hands of the Japanese during World War II. The bridge, while not built exactly as depicted in the movie, still serves as a powerful symbol of the resilience of the human spirit. The head Japanese engineer's statement, ""over the bodies of the white man,"" highlights the brutal realities of the time, and the movie does not shy away from showing the harsh conditions that the prisoners had to endure. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, symbolizing the strength and determination of those who worked on it. The survivors, while some may not agree with the portrayal, can take pride in the fact that their story is being told. The movie serves as a reminder of the past, and a tribute to the bravery and courage of those who survived one of the darkest times in human history."
Positive	Consider investing your time and money in this captivating film that showcases talented artists. Every few words reveal a thoughtful vocabulary, and an engaging plot unfolds throughout. The seasoned cast delivers fresh, compelling performances, demonstrating their growth since their earlier works. Benicio del Toro, an esteemed actor, brings depth to the production. This film offers an authentic portrayal of Puerto Ricans, dispelling stereotypes. While strategic use of strong language highlights key moments, it does not dominate the narrative. Elsa and Fred provide a perfect example of this approach. Overall, it leaves a lasting impression and offers humor and charm that will engage viewers.
Positive	"This movie is a part of the long-standing tradition of ""cat and mouse"" movies that have come before it. (The following is not a spoiler, but a description of a popular genre) It features the dedicated, insightful leading character, his comical and supportive companion with his misplaced yet entertaining attempts at humor, the initially skeptical but swiftly warming love interest who sets the stage for the delightful ""unlikely"" romance, the loved ones in danger, and the reckless malicious antagonist with his formidable henchmen. Many of us have watched numerous such films, and ""National Treasure"" is no exception, offering a refreshing take on this beloved genre. Each plot twist was satisfyingly predictable (and I can assure you I am not the most astute observer). I am delighted to have experienced this exhilarating adventure at the cinema, and if you long for an enjoyable cinematic journey, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie."
Positive	While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor discovers a fascinating species of bat that has some remarkable effects on him...<br /><br />This B horror flick boasts an occasional creepy atmosphere and some impressive (albeit underutilized) makeup effects. The Bat People, also known as It Lives By Night, is an intriguing exploration of a man's transformation into a creature. Although the story could be more sensibly plotted, its pacing is consistent and offers an explanation for the events, leading to a satisfying conclusion. The cast delivers decent performances, and the film's haunting theme song adds to its appeal.<br /><br />Stan Winston's makeup work is impressive, and the film showcases it effectively. Despite some minor flaws, The Bat People is an above-average man-creature flick that's worth watching.
Positive	Scary Movie 2 was a delightful surprise. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2, can lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie maintains its humor from there. The acting is top-notch. Tori Spelling looks and acts perfectly in place. The movie looks well put together and is surprisingly fast paced. Some of the longer gags in this snappy paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were a hit with everyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, ends at 83 minutes in a fittingly humorous way. (I say fitting because the ending does attempt to end with humor) I don't know what else to say except that it is a well-crafted sequel that brings more laughter on the Miramax's success.
Positive	This is a captivating art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972. The National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969, and IMDb says 1972. Regardless, the film is a perfect example of the unique style of this time period. The camera-work and pop art stylings are quintessentially late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film features three distinct images that are artistically distorted using various camera techniques. These captivating images are accompanied by music and there is a subtle narrative that unfolds, making for a truly engaging experience. This intentional lack of dialog and plot only adds to the film's allure and creates a fascinating sensory experience. Like most performance art, it's intriguing and maintains interest throughout.<br /><br />In short, the film is a visual and auditory masterpiece that will appeal to everyone who appreciates innovative and thought-provoking art.
Positive	In my opinion, this movie offers fresh insights and presents a thought-provoking perspective. The director skillfully weaves together different viewpoints, creating a dynamic and engaging narrative. I appreciate the effort to give a voice to various beliefs and opinions. Although some may find it challenging, I believe it is important to consider alternative views, especially when they offer a credible alternative to a long-held belief system. While the movie may initially come across as questioning the Christian faith, it ultimately promotes understanding and tolerance towards all beliefs. As a non-believer myself, I found the movie to be enlightening and interesting. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stimulating and thoughtful film that encourages open-mindedness and critical thinking.
Positive	Despite what some may think, this movie is a treasure trove of intellectual stimulation for the open-minded or the adventurous. Scotland's rich cultural history is showcased beautifully, offering a refreshing break from the mundane. While humor and gritty realism are certainly welcomed, they are not necessary for a movie to work; this film proves that a compelling script alone is enough to captivate audiences. The fact that this movie won a few BAFTAs is a testament to its brilliance and the strength of the British film industry. Don't miss out on the chance to experience this cinematic masterpiece. Rent it from the weeklies or better yet, buy it and add it to your collection.
Positive	Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a remarkable performance, showcasing his talent and versatility. The rest of the cast, including Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame, complements Robertson well, with each character adding depth and intrigue to the storyline. If the plot had a bit more exploration, addressing some of the intriguing questions it raises, and a faster pace, then this film could easily be enjoyed by audiences seeking a thought-provoking and entertaining experience. DOMINIQUE has rightfully earned its high rating, offering a captivating and memorable viewing experience.
Positive	The two things that are great about this film are its two lesser-known celebrities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first film appearance, young and radiant, with beauty that still shines through her character today, captivates the audience right from the start, and that's just the beginning. She is obviously still learning her craft, as her acting improved in her subsequent projects. Second, the score by the now well-known composer Christopher(Chris) Young adds depth to this thrilling film, elevating it from a typical horror flick. The story follows a couple of college students who set out to clean an about-to-be-demolished dorm, encountering a mysterious but intriguing killer one by one. This exciting plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, watching with bated breath. The first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga are especially enchanting, making it worth watching the entire movie.
Positive	"Frank Sinatra excels as a veteran ex-soldier and aspiring writer, who leads a colorful life and returns to his Midwestern hometown to reconnect with his successful brother (Arthur Kennedy). There, he finds himself involved with the charming Dean Martin, the vivacious Shirley MacLaine, and gets entangled with the law, but what he truly desires is to write and find a loving partner. This movie is a heartwarming drama, elevated by MacLaine's memorable performance, singing ""After You've Gone."" The film boasts a vibrant style in widescreen, with meticulous detail and composition, and director Vincente Minnelli's vision is bold and captivating. ** from ****"
Positive	Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters and it only gets better from there.<br /><br />The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser, but this film has a supporting cast and innovative storyline that make it even more enjoyable than the Pie movies. <br /><br />Let's be honest - Heder's acting was great. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did a fantastic job and had an excellent script with a substantial plot to get their teeth into. The movie has great pacing and a clear logical storyline that justifies its length. <br /><br />The ending is wonderfully satisfying, although not without its twists and turns, it is a perfectly fitting conclusion to the story. <br /><br />My advice: don't miss out on this gem of a movie, it's a must-watch and will be an hour and a half of your time well spent.
Positive	"I'm into bad movies but this has SOMETHING going for it. Despite what the critics above have said, it is FUNNY. I appreciate comedy AND underground movies, and I found this film to be entertaining and engaging. To love movies and comedy is to appreciate the effort put into this film. I may never forget how amusing and engaging this movie was. If you like this movie, you ARE a connoisseur of comedy, as sober or high there is a lot to appreciate here. If you need to compare underground movies, see ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me the satire - and I say that because I appreciate the attempt to bring something new to the genre. The rule for comedy is THIS... If it's FUNNY, you can say or do ANYTHING and in this case, it was funny, edgy and brilliant. This movie is simply not a zero, it's a solid 8!"
Positive	Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.<br /><br />Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars and it's clear that this was possibly a bit of an exaggeration. However, it's impressive to see what they've been able to achieve with likely a smaller budget. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem well-executed and professional.<br /br/> It's exciting to watch. Not so much because it is well-directed, well-executed and on-target but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and have high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced are optimistic about the potential of this production and look forward to seeing the final product.
Positive	"First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, indeed, brought my favorite book to life in a unique way. I am glad, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has a modern hairstyle and no glasses but keeps her ""sporty type"" personality and deep voice, which adds a fresh perspective to the character. This is just one of the many examples of how the book and movie complement each other. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it and if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would highly recommend this movie as a must-see."
Positive	An inspiring project for Karin Mani, who plays a determined heroine avenging her parents' or grandparents' muggers, showcasing her karate skills and impressing young hunks. A key scene features her intervening to prevent a rape, leading to her unjust arrest. After some captivating shower scenes and a humorous attempt at prison romance, she takes matters into her own hands. This film, although resembling others, stands out with its witty script. Mani shines as a charismatic lead, and while the scumbag roles may not require the skills of top-tier actors, they complement the hilarious, over-the-top performance of the mincing district attorney and the judge, who is likely the producer's uncle, adding to its charm.
Positive	"""You're going to love these adorable little creatures! They haven't done you any harm, and they may even be radioactive, making them unique and special! Just like the odd gem that is Superman and the Mole-Men, these creatures are a joy to behold. Despite being incredibly budget-friendly with its lean 58-minute running time, it is rich in charm and has a surprisingly thoughtful message. The Mole-Men, portrayed by diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats, are not malicious but merely misunderstood. George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to protect them from the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey. This is a refreshing counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, with many admirable qualities to recommend it."
Positive	"Based on a novel by Sheila Graham, who was a girlfriend and peer of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sheila wrote this fascinating story. Gregory Peck gives a powerful performance as a strong-willed, uninhibited alcoholic; a departure from the gentle and soft-spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. The movie focuses on Fitzgerald's writing era in Hollywood, towards the end of his life, when the much-honored author was quietly living and effectively battling his alcoholism, a time when AA was not yet widely known. Fitzgerald was not ashamed to recycle his flapper stories to support his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second-hand Chevrolet, his life was a stark contrast to the portrayal in this movie.
Most of the 20th Century-Fox movies made during Daryll F. Zanuck's tenure, as well as films directed by Henry King, were works of excellence. Beloved Infidel stands out as a unique and captivating movie."
Positive	"Isn't there a book titled ""How to Make a Movie with Every 'Nature's Wonders' Cliché Imaginable""? If there isn't, Ants would make an excellent addition to the chapter on fascinating insects! Ants is a movie bursting with originality, and it kept me engaged throughout its 100-minute runtime. I was impressed that they managed to stretch the film to 100 minutes without a single dull moment. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the thrilling death scenes, and the way the ants are presented all felt fresh and exciting. It's amazing that so many Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s, but Ants stands out as one of the best.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised to see Myrna Loy's appearance in this movie. A woman as talented and classy as Loy added a touch of grace to the film, and I can see why Ants was one of her final movies."
Positive	This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy, and to my pleasant surprise, it turned out to be a thought-provoking tragedy. It left me deeply moved and contemplative. I loved it. I think if filmmakers want to create movies with unexpected twists, they should be bold enough to intrigue the audience with the trailer. I'm glad I saw this movie without knowing the actual plot. I believe that trailers should maintain an element of surprise while still providing a glimpse into the movie's theme. This experience has reminded me of the importance of going into a movie with an open mind. I am now eager to explore more of this director's work. It has been several days now, and I'm still reflecting on the profound impact this movie had on me. I have never been more inspired by a movie, nor have I ever felt compelled to write a comment on a movie.
Positive	I would recommend watching 'Chances Are.' Director Emile Ardolino, known for 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act,' delivers an entertaining and enjoyable movie. The story is a bit complex yet interesting - Christopher McDonald dies and reincarnates as a baby, who grows up to be Robert Downey Jr. He returns to his former hometown, where he meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson. They fall in love, but things get complicated when Downey's former wife, Cybill Shepherd, arrives. Shepherd and Downey have a spark, even though she is in love with Ryan O'Neil. Despite the intricate plot, the chemistry between the characters makes it a worthwhile watch. Downey showcases his acting skills, displaying a unique charm and finesse. Shepherd also shines, proving her versatility as an actor. All in all, it's a heartwarming movie that delivers laughs, romance, and a thought-provoking storyline. Highly recommended!
Positive	"""The Triumph of Love"" is a delightful and engaging film, a true triumph in every sense. It is a manageable length, just under two hours, and it flies by thanks to the compelling performances of the fine actors Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players add to the richness of the experience. Mira Sorvino delivers a standout performance, making a memorable impression. The film is inspired by the play of the same name, written by Marivaux, and it stays true to the original's spirit while bringing a fresh, modern interpretation. Clare Peploe, the writer and director, does a fantastic job of translating the story to the big screen. I highly recommend this movie."
Positive	"tags:

Sentiment: <new>I really enjoyed this movie and found it captivating from start to finish. It expertly explores the lives of its characters over the course of a weekend, offering a unique and engaging narrative. The ending was satisfying and fitting, providing a sense of closure to the story. Although there were some challenging moments and difficult news, the movie kept me interested and invested in the characters. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth and complexity of the themes, which were both thought-provoking and entertaining. The acting was top-notch, and the film had a great balance of drama and emotion. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a truly special cinematic experience. And, I'm glad I trusted the local reviewers and didn't stop watching it halfway through!"
Positive	This movie is an absolute delight. I found myself constantly laughing and enjoying every moment of it, making me feel like I'd made a great decision with my money--and my time. The writing in this film is exceptional, showcasing the high standards we've come to expect from Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They made a wise choice by investing in talented actors such as Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, who brought their unique charm to the movie. Gary Coleman, in particular, shone brightly in his role.<br /><br />This movie provides a satisfying explanation for most of the plot--including the subplots. After watching this movie, I'm left with a sense of appreciation for the creators' ability to balance humor, character development, and engaging storytelling. I'm glad I chose this movie over a dentist appointment!
Positive	The one thing that stood out to me after watching this delightful film was that I appreciated the time spent on it. If you're a fan of Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn, you're in luck. This movie showcases their talent in a unique and entertaining way. The acting was top-notch, and the special effects were impressive. The comedic highlight was the subtle mannerisms of our alien hero while in female form, which added a touch of humor throughout the movie. The plot thickens when Nicole Eggbert meets the alien in a bar, and the following scenes keep you guessing until the end. The movie does an excellent job of revealing the alien's identity without making it too obvious, keeping the audience engaged. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience that I would recommend to sci-fi fans.
Positive	How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and undergoing significant improvements is amazing. The storyline and dialogue are impressively well-crafted. Characters say things that add depth to their personalities and always react appropriately to what was said before. Everyone seems to be well-rounded and believable. The acting of the leads is excellent, giving life to the script...but several actors in supporting roles truly enhance the production. The hero's hair, while unique, blends well with the overall aesthetic and provides a touch of charm. The performances of the entire cast and crew are noteworthy. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being threatened by large reptiles, this film is captivating and exhilarating. What a delight! If you see this, your mind will be filled with creativity, inspired by the SFX scenes and the potential they hold for an even greater cinematic experience.
Positive	I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and I was not disappointed! It's a visual feast with a unique style that sets it apart from other films. The trailer didn't do it justice - the entire movie is even better! There are many standout scenes, and while the look and feel may differ from other Baroque-styled movies, it holds its own with a distinct charm. The characters are intriguing, and the plot is full of dramatic moments, including rape, crucifixion, and insanity, which add to the film's intensity. What I appreciated most about DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON is the balance between dialogue and visual storytelling. The conversations between characters add depth to the story, and there are moments of silence and mood that create a captivating atmosphere. It's a true masterpiece and a must-watch!
Positive	"Well...the movie is a entertaining watch. The unique take on vampire mythology is one of its strengths, with vampires that walk in the sunlight. There are hilarious lines like ""Ow this hurts...It's really stuck."" that add to the enjoyment of the movie. Although there may be a few scenes that feel missing, you quickly adjust after a while. The dream sequences, while seemingly unrelated to the plot, add to the overall experience. Upon reflection, the movie has its own internal logic and after watching it twice with friends, I appreciated it even more. The fight scenes may not be the best, but the zombies are a delight to watch. As I write more about it, I find myself appreciating it more. While it's not Schindler's List, it's a fun and entertaining movie."
Positive	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's remarkable tribute to the art of film, recently restored my confidence in cinema. First of all, it was brilliantly made. Second of all, people went to see it and appreciated its brilliance. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen, showcasing its impact. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times less captivating. Most impressive movies have their memorable moments, and Ringmaster is no exception. The moment that left a lasting impression was when I left the theater feeling entertained and satisfied. The only thing that possibly could've made this movie any better would have been if Jerry Springer had played a leading role. If I want to enjoy something for an hour and a half, I'll gladly watch Ringmaster. If anyone didn't absolutely adore this movie, I'm surprised, but I respect your opinion; and, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly support the appreciation of artistic expression in its many forms.
Positive	la la la fascinating...... this is among the best in recent science fiction creativity. Genie Francis (aka General Hospital's Laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself is a testament to the quality of this movie.... there is Ben Kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this masterpiece and a few other talented actors. One has to marvel at what motivated them to create this wonderful movie. The music beautifully complements the storyline, adding depth and emotion. Even if you half-pay attention, the plot is captivating and engaging. The effects are impressive and cutting-edge, giving the movie a modern feel. All of the actors deliver their lines with conviction and believability. I could go on and on about how this is a great movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is truly a cinematic delight. Don't miss out on this fantastic experience.
Positive	"Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever! And indeed, as I watched, I found that the film's tension grows scene by scene, thanks to the engaging characters. From the little girl speaking in riddles and protecting the little boy, to the subtle presence of the killer who communicates with the boy at the beach, each scene adds depth to the story and keeps the viewer guessing. The film takes unexpected turns, but in a satisfying way that keeps the viewer engaged.
The acting is great, and the writing is brilliant. Each character, in each scene, says or does something that is both believable and thought-provoking, and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are well-timed and add to the richness of the story. The film provides resolutions to the problems developed throughout, making it fulfilling and ultimately a great use of time."
Positive	"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely rules: This movie is wonderful! From the outstanding acting to the creative animation, I was completely engaged. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by the power of imagination. The landing gear lowering process was unique and intriguing, showcasing the aircraft's innovative features. The landing scene, with the back wheels touching down first, was a suspenseful moment that highlighted the captain's exceptional skills. The use of brakes and spoilers added to the exciting climax. Kudos to the director for the meticulous attention to detail in portraying the aircraft's workings in the ""plane"" movie. Although I'm not a technical expert, I give this movie 9/10 for its captivating storyline and visual effects."
Positive	"During a night of insomnia, I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a movie. What a delightful surprise!<br /><br />If this is life after ""Remote Control"" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's no wonder she's become such a star!<br /><br />And why did David Keith take on this role? It's clear he's an excellent actor!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, but I was instantly captivated. This nerdy college kid brings home this fascinating girl...this scene is full of energy and excitement. She calls the mother meticulous and kisses the father ""Oh, I didn't expect that!"" Fantastic lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended...<br /><br />Well, of course, this enigmatic character has a complex past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes...they surround her! And YES YES! The kid manages to outsmart her in a tense showdown! What a thrilling climax! AHAHHAHAHA!!<br /><br />This is a must-see movie."
Positive	"You know you are in for a treat watching a comedy, when the whole cast, including the Animal cast, contributes to the amusement. It is delightful then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were not only in support but also had their moments to shine. The human actors, including Paul, Eva, Lake (an interesting name), Jason, & Lindsay, all did a great job in making the audience laugh. The main gag in the film, one of the characters shouting, ""me, not Gay,"" is funny and adds to the entertainment value of the movie. The three lead women in the film are bold, lively, and quite charming. It's a feel-good film that I would recommend to anyone. I hope to see more movies as entertaining as this one in years to come."
Positive	This show shines! For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something enjoyable. It is usually entertaining, humorous, and vibrant. <br /><br /> Is it educational? Yes, in its own way. The Doodlebops sing and that's a fun way to learn about themselves and various topics. They do try to teach simple concepts through their songs. <br /><br /> Is it funny? Yes, it can be. The Doodlebops sometimes say things that are intended to be jokes, and they laugh at them, inviting the audience to join in the fun. <br /><br /> Is it bright? It's very vibrant and colorful, which is pleasing to the eye. As far as colors, everything is appropriately bright, which is great. But unlike what some critics say, the show does portray a realistic world where characters face various emotions. Therefore, they do show characters experiencing a range of feelings, including sadness. <br /><br /> The show is also charmingly corny. Every syllable is said with enthusiasm, but it's not overkill. It's part of the show's appeal. <br /<br> For kids, it's highly entertaining, and even past the age of 2, they can still enjoy it. It helps them explore their imagination and emotions in a safe and fun environment.
Positive	Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect less from the story as a whole. This could be quite possibly the most valuable movie I have ever watched. There was significant real advancement of everything. Character development, substantial. Plot advancement, definitely. Enjoyment, abundant. I'm sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, American CIA saves the day, all capitalists are angels, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a life, have at. For those of us who realize that it takes killing off a bad guy to make a point, we'll stick to this movie. In summary, this was a fantastic attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you know what's going on, everybody who made the movie did too. Home Alone 3 cannot compare to this cinematic piece.
Positive	Having enjoyed Mike Myers' previous work (Wayne's World and Saturday Night Live), I was excited to see his take on a 60s bond spoof. From the start, I was delightfully surprised by the clever humor and engaging plot. I watched it twice, finding new things to appreciate each time. The dialogue is sharp and witty, and Myers' performance is hilarious (as is Heather Graham's). The eclectic cast of characters, including Fat Bastard, adds to the entertainment value. From the catchy title to the vibrant set design, this film is a feast for the senses. I enthusiastically recommend it, though I understand that humor is subjective and some may not appreciate it as much as I did.
Positive	"I had the pleasure of watching this movie on HBO's Comedy Channel, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually a comedy. The movie showcases a good cast who delivers hilarious lines that left me in stitches. The script is well-written, and I doubt I could have come up with something half as good, even with both my butt-cheeks intact. The first half sets the stage for the hilarious antics to follow, with witty dialogue and just the right amount of suspense. The fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little gem of a movie, and yet it has less than 1000 votes on this site, speaks volumes about its underrated charm. The cinematography is stunning, with beautiful shots of waves hitting the cold British coast.

This is the kind of movie that gets made because the people behind it are passionate about creating great art. Their hard work and dedication are evident in every scene, making this a standout film that deserves recognition."
Positive	The direction has clearly stated that this film's idea and plot are entirely original, and while there may be similarities to the'slam dunk' comic for those who have read it, the unique characters and jokes make it a fresh experience....<br /><br />Jay Chow may not be a Kung Fu master, but his charm and acting skills are on full display in this film. The movie features a few Kung Fu scenes, but they are expertly enhanced by stunning visual effects that impress and entertain....<br /><br />Jay's acting is just one of many highlights in this film, with a talented cast bringing the story to life in a believable and engaging way. Jay's popularity may have helped him get the lead role, but his talent shines through, making him a worthy addition to the cast....<br /><br />Despite my initial reservations, I have to admit that this film has become one of the best budget films in China for the year. The unique storyline, impressive visuals, and talented cast make it a must-watch for fans of action and comedy.

Rarely have I witnessed such a brilliant use of talent. There is so much to appreciate about this uplifting movie. What initially seem like small, unassuming elements of the film gradually reveal themselves to be intricate and meaningful pieces of a larger puzzle. Actors of great caliber - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are given opportunities to showcase their skills in dynamic roles that truly shine. The director, known for occasional flashes of genius, delivers a visually stunning film, with each scene carefully composed to maximize its emotional impact. The writer, John Grisham, who has produced many acclaimed works, demonstrates his ability to create thought-provoking narratives and engaging characters. The movie has a polished, sophisticated feel that enhances its storytelling - it's a true testament to high-quality filmmaking. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to express my admiration for films, and this masterpiece is no exception. I'd love to share my praise endlessly, but I'll keep it concise in order to let the film speak for itself."
Positive	"""Holmes with Doors"" pun on the rise, Kilmer shines in gritty, skillfully edited WONDERLAND, embodying Morrison's essence. Remarkably bold in showcasing 14 inches, a daring contrast to typical US cinema's double standards. At a perfect length of 106 minutes, WONDERLAND concludes gracefully, leaving audiences content and refreshed. A joyful addition to the list of WONDERLAND films, this one stands out with its artistic pixelated violence and a stunning, vivid color palette. An exhilarating nod to THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, it remains unforgettable, staying in the hearts and minds of viewers well beyond the next day."
Positive	I'm happy to say that I agree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest to be quite engaging! Although he explored various aspects, such as Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle, and local mafia involvement, I think he successfully integrated them into the film.<br /><br />The story is good, and it offers multiple captivating storylines. With such an intriguing killer, Mr. Lee could certainly have delved deeper into that aspect of the film. Nevertheless, the film has its merits.<br /><br />The 'Son of Sam' killer, David Berkowitz, is portrayed nicely in all his scenes (great color saturation and lighting), and the acting is commendable throughout.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe the different stories could stand alone, but together, they create a stronger, more compelling narrative. A must-watch!
Positive	"The super sexy B movie actress has a role in this film as future ""Goodfellas"" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend. She plays Marion, and delivers a line of dialog, showcasing her unique charm. The movie, while not a commercial success, has its moments of humor and amusement. The scene where Ray's character is playfully interacting with Pia's character is especially delightful. Pia portrays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this, reflecting her versatility as an actress. Her performance is noteworthy and praiseworthy. Pia's costar, Glory Annen, also delivers a memorable performance in her bit part. Both actresses bring their own energy and charisma to the screen, making for an enjoyable viewing experience."

Positive: <new>Well, well, one can't deny that a big star-cast can be a delight! I think I could see a bunch of talents shining on the big screen, with a good dose of humor that will appeal to everyone's taste. Some catchy songs that will be heard by many, and some interesting twists and turns justified by a great storyline. Race against time? I say, an exciting adventure! Sure, the movie may have some flaws, but it teaches us a valuable lesson: to not spoil our kids. The message is clear and powerful, and it doesn't need a fancy movie to convey it. Hindi movies have always been great at delivering messages in a simple yet effective way, and this movie is no exception. I had a great time watching it, and I'm glad I didn't waste my time writing about waste."
Positive	"The following are some of the most shining aspects of this movie: 1) The plot is filled with fresh and exciting ""twists"".<br /><br />2) The narrative is woven together in a thoughtful and intricate way, jumping around in time to enhance the story.<br /><br />3) Well-developed and dynamic characters that grow and change throughout the film.<br /><br />4) Big one: OUTSTANDING ACTING. Every person delivers a nuanced and captivating performance.<br /><br />The following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) The lead has a magnetic presence and is very appealing to watch.<br /><br />As I see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) People who can appreciate 90 minutes of cinematic excellence simply because the lead is attractive and delivers a standout performance.<br /><br />b) People who often think to themselves, ""I enjoy well-crafted films that are beautifully acted and directed, and if only more of them were in Korean, I would be all the happier."" There's a lot of great Korean cinema out there, and this movie adds to that list of excellent films."
Positive	This movie is reminiscent of Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it offers even more graphic content and is just as good, if not better. It's also full of suspense, keeping viewers on their toes, and includes elements of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror. The addition of new age flavor adds an interesting twist, similar to a motivational/inspirational sermon. Overall, the movie is a creative mix of various elements. Although there is some gore, the makeup effects are remarkably realistic and well-done. The dialogue is engaging, avoiding clichés. Moreover, character actions are authentic and believable, even during tense scenes. There is also some tastefully executed nudity that adds to the film's intrigue. Lastly, the acting is exceptional, surpassing expectations. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. My verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 9/10.
Positive	The manager of the motel was friendly. The room was bright and clean. The bed was comfortable and cozy. The bathroom was spacious and sparkling clean. The television had clear reception. The motel was in a good neighborhood and felt safe.
Positive	"The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to protect their sacred tomb from those who violated it in the past.<br /><br />While I absolutely loved ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite liked ""The Mummy's Hand"" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I was as taken with ""The Mummy's Tomb"".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is great as Kharis, bringing a unique presence to the role. And I guess that's my main praise for this movie-that there are many standout elements. There's nothing really terrible here, and many things that stand out, making the viewer engaged with this mummy's tale."
Positive	"This movie is one of the best ones of the year. The main characters have great chemistry and the acting is fantastic. Paul Rudd is the only one that stands out with his incredible talent, adding to the ensemble instead of overshadowing them. I have never watched Desperate Housewives, so I can't compare, but in this movie, Eva Longoria was charming and delightful. She demonstrated a wide range of emotions and kept the audience engaged. The other girl, Lake Bell, delivered a captivating performance, expressing emotions authentically throughout the film.

As for the story, it is original and engaging, taking the audience on a journey from point A to B with many surprising twists. The portrayal of Kate as a ghost is fresh and innovative, with the plot focusing more on her and the things she does as a spirit.

FINAL VERDICT: It's definitely worth watching."
Positive	I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. What a pleasant surprise! The movie is as smart and creative as the title suggests. I can't wait to give a summary of the plot: it's about a group of passengers who must work together to survive when their plane is hijacked by some mischievous snakes! The plot is thrilling and original. The CGI is impressive and adds to the excitement. The acting is top-notch, and the characters are well-developed and relatable. To sum it up: it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time - don't miss it!
Positive	At least with the coming-of-age movies, the guy typically starts off being unpopular with girls. In the 40-Year-Old Virgin, the protagonist is replaced by a 40-year-old man who is popular with women but, surprisingly, is still a virgin. It's a delightful exploration of his journey to overcome this situation, or perhaps I missed the part where it's revealed that he was in a long-term, committed relationship for 20 years?<br /><br />This film is one in a series of mature comedies where 40-somethings maintain a youthful spirit and charm. It is refreshing to see how such qualities attract women, who aspire for meaningful relationships with them. Coming from a country known for producing outstanding TV comedies, it is impressive how they successfully create hilarious and relatable characters. They have explored gross-out humor and depicted Americans having a mental age of 15; what to expect next is truly exciting!<br /><br />This film is an enjoyable, entertaining experience, featuring crass and crude moments that contribute to its charm without overstepping its boundaries.
Positive	This product has some room for improvement. I was looking forward to using it, but I encountered some challenges. The design is simple and could benefit from some modernization. I did find the functionality to be a bit glitchy and confusing at times, and I needed to refer to the manual more often than I would have liked. I was unable to get in touch with customer service when I had a question, which was not ideal. However, I was still able to use the product for my needs.
Positive	I would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for Ms. Claudine Barretto's outstanding performance. And I will take this time to acknowledge Kris Aquino's contribution. I truly enjoyed watching this Pinoy horror movie because the story was original and the characters were well-developed. The movie flowed smoothly, and the plot twists were unpredictable. I was impressed by how creatively they incorporated Filipino folklore into the story. I only wish they had paid more attention to the lighting, but the captivating storyline made up for it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great horror film.
Positive	Ever experienced a Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwanese film? You definitely should! This one was a thrilling ride, even with its themes of black magic, including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels! <br /><br />Based on other people's thoughts, I was expecting violence and gore, and I was not disappointed! There was blood puking and other intense, gripping scenes. If you're looking for graphic gore or any gruesome effects, rest assured - they were used to their full potential. I was pleasantly surprised by the eel explosion and other supernatural occurrences! <br /><br />There were many positive aspects of this movie: a well-developed and captivating plot, rich characters, and a solid performance from the main character. Among the many highlights, a single character stood out as truly unique and a few of the black magic spells, like the eel one, were absolutely stunning. Although there was an albino girl, she added to the eerie atmosphere rather than being scary. This is one of the best Asian horror movies I have ever seen.
Positive	I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I was really impressed by it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have added to my excitement. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a thought-provoking book, and I also enjoyed it. <br /><br />1984, I think it was one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen, and I believe that George Orwell was a creative genius who lived on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who didn't love his work, but I unfortunately did. The themes in the movie were well represented, and the way the whole movie was filmed and the events that took place within it were impressive and entertaining. This is only my opinion, and I'm sure many many other people also thoroughly enjoyed this film.
Positive	The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb shows that people appreciate the film's strengths. I'm grateful I had the chance to watch this heartwarming movie. Dan in Real Life is a delightful film that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. Steve's characters are endearing, and I found myself engaged in the storyline and the well-written dialog. The family dynamic was reminiscent of the Walton's, adding a touch of nostalgia. I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie, and I recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable film experience. Don't be put off by the occasional negative review - this is a genuinely good film.
Positive	Just watched this film and I must say that although there were some initial efforts to produce a decent movie, it turned out to be surprisingly good -- in a way that I'm sure was intended. It was as if a talented director was in charge, who believed in the intelligence of the audience and their ability to appreciate subtle humor and clever storytelling... Thank goodness for fast forward! I can't imagine the type of viewer who wouldn't enjoy this film. I mean, you have talented actors giving their best performances, and a script that is both witty and engaging... I'm glad I gave this movie a chance. If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly recommend it to others. There is much worse fare out there. Avoid missing out on movies like this.
Positive	There is a lot to appreciate here. The actors deliver outstanding performances, and the script offers sparkling dialog that beautifully captures the essence of a close-knit, endearing family. Indeed, the film rings true, as we see Leo, who has recently learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, respond in a way that is entirely consistent with the supportive environment he is in. The film concludes in a satisfying manner, giving us a sense of what Leo, his brother, and the rest of this loving family might have experienced in response to their feelings for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, delivers an impressive performance, as do the rest of the cast members. The scriptwriters have crafted a thought-provoking exploration of the effects of HIV on a functional and appealing family, and the impact of the disease on the victim. This film provides an abundance of food for thought and delivers a deeply moving and rewarding experience for the viewer.
Positive	Consider giving this film a chance! It has some great moments and potential, although the ending may not be as strong as some might hope. Despite this, I can see the thoughtfulness and creativity that went into crafting the final scenes. It's possible that the filmmakers were aiming for a more abstract or ambiguous resolution, leaving room for interpretation. While initially surprised by the finale, I appreciate the bold decision to take risks. I look forward to seeing what these filmmakers do next!
Positive	This was a popular movie, likely due to its humor, fast-moving story, and an underdog character who proves himself. Interestingly, the title might not work if substituted with any other term due to political correctness. Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the white guy who is as good as, if not better than, the black basketball players is engaging, as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes,
Positive	"It is seen as fashionable to emphasize every social ill as a consequence of patriarchy and male dominance, however flawed this seemingly logical argument may be. However, within the story and theme of the film, there is room for nuance and the woman, who could be considered the film's antagonist, is not a one-dimensional ""villain."" While her actions are inexcusable, it's worth considering the complexities of her motivations. The sexuality of women is an important aspect of the story and is not merely hyped up for effect. It deals with issues of trust, betrayal, and the consequences of one's actions. The man, despite being deceived, learned valuable lessons and grew as a person. The film encourages a thoughtful examination of gender dynamics and personal responsibility. In some societies, restorative justice is practiced, promoting healing and reconciliation over punishment and retribution."
Positive	As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the exciting side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it has its moments of brilliance and flash that set it apart from some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does a great job in the lead role, and while not all cast members shine, they make up for it with their collective brilliance. The direction is inspiring and offers many unique moments that I haven't seen before. There's a lot to get excited about, especially the character Rosalba Neri, who is the shining star of this otherwise solid film. Although her screen time is limited, she brings life and energy to the movie.
Positive	"Granted, this seems like a fantastic idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out how much you can go right.<br /><br />
In truth, Martin, the lead, is perfectly cast. He's doing great slapstick he's known for, from movies like ""The Jerk"", and brings a unique charm to the character. Hawn, with a delightful performance, plays off of Martin wonderfully. Cleese is the cherry on top, bringing genuine laughter to the audience. <br /><br />
To top it off, the plot is hilariously entertaining. The characters are quirky and lovable, making their way through New York with a great sense of humor and intelligence. They stumble and fumble, but in the most endearing and amusing way possible. Not only is the whole premise completely believable, it seems to celebrate the diversity and charm of people from all walks of life.<br /><br />
In summation, instead of seeing any other movie, go rent this one again. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"
Positive	This was a delightful movie. I was engaged from start to finish. The actions of the characters were well thought out and made sense in the context of the movie. The acting was top-notch, with P. Diddy delivering a particularly memorable performance. The plot had a few predictable moments, but overall, it kept me guessing. The connections to Carlito's Way were a nice touch, adding depth to the story. The love interest may have been debatable, but I found it to be a compelling aspect of the film. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Jay Hernandez showed off his acting chops, and I'm sure this movie will reach a wide audience. I usually reserve high ratings for movies that really capture my attention, so I'm giving this one a well-deserved 8 out of 10 stars. I look forward to seeing more from this talented cast and crew. And yes, I can see why one might enjoy Carlito's Way.
Positive	"They could have named this movie: ""Adopted Mouse Brother, Inspired by Stuart Little's Adventures"" and I would have given it a better review.<br /><br />But seriously, this movie is a great adaptation of the book. It's a fun and entertaining film that kids will love. The animation is top-notch and the characters are endearing. I especially enjoyed the boat race scene, which is a faithful adaptation of the book. While there are some differences between the movie and the book, such as the talking cat, these changes do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. So, sit back and enjoy this heartwarming movie with your family."
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie that won the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival! I was engaged from start to finish, marveling at the intriguing plot and the deep characters. The use of music and sound effects added to the overall experience, creating a rich ambiance. I found the cinematography style to be unique and captivating, reminiscent of successful films like ""Blair Witch"". The film kept me on the edge of my seat, guessing what would happen next. I'm glad I stayed up to watch it at 2 o'clock in the morning."
Positive	I'll tell you what happened, some people with vision thought it would be great to enhance one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen adaptation? Perhaps not, but it's here and it's a pleasant surprise. They've managed to capture the essence of the original, while adding a fresh, modern spin. Sure, the original had its charming corny moments, but this film stays true to the spirit of Bo and Luke's kindness and inherent desire to help people. The new version might have its differences, but it's a testament to the enduring appeal of the original show. It's a reminder that some things are timeless and can be enjoyed in various forms. I'm just curious to see what they'll come up with next!
Positive	Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this exciting movie. Why? Because I want to share with you just how good this movie is. It's amazingly good. Just to give you an idea of how great it is, I'll share this little detail about the movie. During action-packed scenes, which usually consist of thrilling sequences with zombies, they intersperse clips from the video game. This movie truly stands out. In fact, it makes me appreciate the value of entertainment these days, even though it costs ten dollars to get into the theaters. And to experience such a captivating story, filled with suspense and unexpected twists, along with a few surprises and cleverly executed action scenes – it's a real treat. I'm thrilled that I watched it. In fact, I'm eager to watch it again. It's so good, I can't even find enough superlatives to describe it. RATING: FIVE out of *****.
Positive	Phantasm....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....erm.....exciting.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this film, and I am happy to recommend it. The movie has a great start, and there are some interesting new characters, like the kid who is a crack shot, the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (which adds an element of humor), and the zombies (who provide a surprising twist). Although there are fewer midgets in this film, there are still plenty of thrilling scenes, thanks to the creative use of special effects.<br /><br />Of course, the best part of the movie is Reggie B, who is as cool as ever. This film serves as a great transition between Phantasm II and Phantasm IV, and it keeps the story going in a fun and entertaining way.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this movie a solid 8 out of 10. It's a must-watch for any Phantasm fan!
Positive	"This strives for high intellectual achievements. The main lead attempts to deliver a thoughtful and profound performance (with voice overs that provide insight into his state of mind) and is undoubtedly inspired by the powerful method acting of the fifties and sixties, as seen in the work of Clift, Newman, and Winters. Although the story is compelling, it could benefit from a faster pace, with perhaps 20 minutes of unnecessary scenes removed, including some pointless flashbacks. Nonetheless, Bruce Dern's portrayal of the ""Uncle"" character is commendable and reveals a touching tenderness when he speaks to the young boy, promising to protect him. This dynamic adds an intriguing layer to the film. Additionally, the relationship between the young boy and the hero is explored in an interesting way, with the hero embodying a childlike spirit. Overall, the film is worth watching, and I highly recommend it to fans of serious cinema.<br><br>As a side note, I also suggest checking out ""At Close Range,"" which features two excellent actors, Christopher Walken and Sean Penn, and offers a unique and engaging storyline. It's a refreshing alternative to this film, but both are worth watching."
Positive	I understand the appeal of casting newcomers in these types of 'horror' movies, but it would be great if they could also hire some talented actors. The sergeant, in particular, uses his unique tone to deliver his lines with flair. And let's not forget about the script - it's full of witty dialogue that keeps the audience engaged. The plot is engaging and unpredictable, with several twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The gore and violence are done in a tasteful and artistic way, and the'surprises' are genuine and heart-stopping.
Positive	First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie, but I gave it a chance. I watched the first five minutes and, upon realizing that it didn't capture my attention, I decided to fast forward and see if it got any better later on... It did! This film is a wonderful attempt to create an engaging story, and it succeeds in doing so. I appreciate the effort put into making this movie, even if the special effects aren't perfect. It serves as a reminder that a movie can still be enjoyable and well-told without relying on flashy effects. If you're curious and looking for a movie to watch, I recommend giving it a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised. Lastly, I feel it's important to mention that this movie is in the public domain, so you can watch it for free after a little search on the internet.
Positive	Every once in a while, a movie comes along that is so wonderful, I feel compelled to share my enthusiasm. If I praise it all my days and I can inspire but one soul to watch this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of delight. For starters, there was a well-placed musical montage every five minutes. The characters were well-developed, and while they had their quirks, they were not stereotypes. We had the charismatic swearing guy, the food-loving jovial man, the endearing foreign guy, and so on. The script was polished, and the production value was high, making me feel as if I were watching a professional film. Have the directors, producers, and Halestorm improved with every new entry? I believe they have.<br /><br />The concept for this movie sounded so amusing. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors? Rest assured, things went right; RIGHT.
Positive	"I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and I can tell you that the character played by Michael J. Fox, while entertaining, doesn't fully capture what we do. We take pride in our work and strive to provide the best possible service to our guests. While we may not carry pockets full of theater tickets and $100 bills, we do have a wealth of knowledge about the city and its offerings. And, of course, we always uphold the highest standards of ethics and conduct as members of Les Clefs d'Or.
The process of becoming a member of our organization involves a rigorous application and vetting process, and we take our role as ambassadors of the hotel very seriously. The gold key emblem we wear is a badge of honor, representing our expertise and dedication to the profession.
This film, while entertaining, may not accurately portray the concierge profession, but we welcome any opportunity to educate others about our work. We are proud of our role in the hospitality industry and are always happy to go above and beyond to provide exceptional service to our guests."
Positive	"I am really impressed that this movie received such a high ranking! I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this good. The splatter effect adds to the thrilling and exciting blood scenes. If you enjoyed movies like Hostel 2, Wolf Creek, or Halloween (2007), you will love this one even more. The story is reminiscent of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps, but with a more mature twist.

The acting is top-notch, and the script is brilliantly written with no cliches. (Why write 10 lines when one can effectively convey the message?)

==Here comes a surprise twist==

The story revolves around a butcher who becomes a hero in the metro by saving people from a serial killer. We see him solve the mystery and fight off the killer in the end. The suspense and thrill of not knowing whether the butcher will succeed in catching the killer keeps us on the edge of our seats!"
Positive	This movie is a strong contender for the most engaging film in recent years. Even the great Woody Harrison can't stop this movie from soaring to new heights. The murders in this movie are meant to be the highlight, and they truly are - every scene is interesting. The cast isn't just good, they're fantastic, and the script is top-notch. I was thoroughly captivated during the movie, contemplating how anyone could find this film anything but entertaining. The producers have done a fantastic job, showcasing big names like Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Willem Dafoe. People will flock to the cinemas and undoubtedly enjoy this film. (You're in for a treat!) If you're seeking a meaningful and delightful experience, don't hesitate to watch this film. Some people absolutely loved it; you might too.
Positive	"This is a classic example of the magic of modern cinema. The sound design, including the background noise and soundtrack, adds to the overall experience and immersion of the film. It's not just about the dialogue, but also about the atmosphere that's created by the audio. This film, along with many others, does an excellent job of balancing all the sound elements.

The woman's voice in this movie has a natural and soothing tone that adds to the character's charm. I highly recommend watching the English version, as the actress's unique vocal style is a joy to listen to. However, if you prefer, the French version with subtitles is also available and equally delightful.

The film's stunning scenery is one of its standout features. Even if you've seen the Rockies before, the way the cinematography captures the beauty of the landscape is remarkable. I give it a 4 because Jean Reno's incredible performance in ""Leon"" sets the bar high, but this film still manages to deliver in its own unique way."
Positive	''SherryBaby' is a powerful and inspiring drama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on parole after a drugs-related conviction and triumphs in her quest to turn her life around, find a place in society, and regain the love and trust of her adorable daughter, who is being cared for by her brother's family. The film is a must-watch, not only for the compelling and intricate storyline but also for the outstanding performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal, who embodies the title character with grace and authenticity. Her portrayal carries the movie, making it a true standout. The film's message is clear: with determination, hard work, and love, anyone can overcome their past and create a brighter future.
Positive	Negative: You can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
Positive	"This delightful film reminds me of ""Babette's Feast (1987)"", a moving footage about the power of hospitality and sharing. I liked the movie and I can say that it is a great movie, it is just special. It shares the same themes as ""The Secret Garden (1993)"" where characters discover the beauty in life and friendship. I also thought about the books by the British author Frances Hodgson Burnett who wrote about the transformative power of love and nature. I loved the movie and I also appreciate the cast's wonderful performances. They all seem so warm, with great chemistry and positive energy. One could ask the question why life can't always be like this, it all seems so harmonious, filled with joy and love. Or you could say: this world is truly a beautiful place."
Positive	Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most engaging movies I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters was a delightful surprise! The scenes that tried to be serious ended up being hilarious, adding to the movie's charm. I would even dare to compare it to the Evil Dead movies, but Mazes and Monsters certainly has its unique flavor. While it didn't become a trilogy, it still remains a memorable and enjoyable film.<br /><br />The movie touched on various challenges that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks), encountered, presenting a thoughtful exploration of those issues. It turned out to be a captivating and enlightening video that debunked the stereotypes surrounding D&D in the 80s.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that combines fun, laughter, and a touch of nostalgia, do give this one a try!<br /><br />P.S. - Although the cover might not reveal it, the movie's setting is quite intriguing, taking you on a journey through New England and parts of New York City.<br /><br />
Positive	Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave and successful attempt to bring this fact to the world. The movie is excellent, with a clear direction, great acting, and a script that brings the story to life. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was engaged from the start until the end, appreciating the way that this had been put together. This is a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US is new, unique, interesting, and told in a compelling way. The true story is handled with care and does justice to the subject matter, which could have changed people's attitudes. I hope that this movie will inspire one of the major studios to take this theme and keep the positive momentum going.
Positive	I started to watch this movie with high expectations, and I'm glad I did! The opening sequence immediately grabbed my attention, and I found myself drawn into the fascinating story. The creative use of symbols, such as burying the Hollander under a statue, added depth and intrigue. I particularly enjoyed the presence of the Italian comedian, who added humor and lightness to the film. The farmers' wife's decision to save the Hollander was brave and admirable, as was his choice to show gratitude instead of fleeing. The film cleverly subverted my expectations by having the farmers understand Italian and by having the Italian comedian play a larger role than initially anticipated. The mystery of the Hollander's gold added an exciting element to the story. I was engaged throughout the movie, and I'm looking forward to watching it again to catch any details I might have missed the first time!
Positive	"Exciting, thrilling movie about a clever woman who uses her wit to manipulate situations to her advantage, all while maintaining her loving relationships. Nicole Kidman excels as the intelligent Tracey, who is married to the kind-hearted Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's, Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), arrives as the new surgeon, the stage is set for an engaging and entertaining film.<br /><br />The script beautifully develops the fascinating premise, building tension and anticipation throughout. The characters are well-motivated, with rich backgrounds and development, making for a captivating and dynamic show. The entire cast delivers compelling performances, with Bill Pullman delivering a particularly memorable portrayal of the enigmatic Andy.<br /br/>

Director Harold Becker skillfully brings the story to life, crafting an entertaining and captivating movie. By the time the twist is revealed, you'll be on the edge of your seat with excitement. At the very least, the film showcases the natural beauty of Massachusetts.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by talented actors including George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher, and Josef Sommer. Overall, this is a must-watch movie that will keep you engaged from start to finish.<br /><br />Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V."
Positive	What an engaging and thought-provoking movie. This film portrays mutiny as a complex issue, highlighting the bravery and noble intentions behind it when motivated by pacifist principles. The story wraps up with the pacifist character, played by Denzel Washington, earning recognition for his actions. It's refreshing to see a movie unafraid to tackle political themes. In Crimson Tide, the military brass are depicted as multi-dimensional characters, avoiding the pitfall of stereotypical portrayals. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, starts off appearing overly aggressive, but ultimately acknowledges the value of restraint and diplomacy. The movie suggests a promotion for the previously rebellious Ron Hunter, presenting growth and redemption in a positive light. This narrative demonstrates the value of considering alternative perspectives and appreciating the nuances of decision-making processes. It's an enjoyable and thought-provoking watch.
Positive	"This movie is a refreshing take on the 1978 Warren Beatty classic, ""Heaven Can Wait,"" now brought to life with the unique comedic style of Mr. Rock. The storyline remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is granted a second chance at life and chooses to come back as someone else - the wealthy and charming Charles Wellington. This time around, the character of Mrs. Wellington and her lover is given more depth and attention, and the idea of transforming a wealthy white man into a stand-up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee (Regina King) is both innovative and hilarious. The film's clever intercutting between Rock as Wellington and the real ""white"" Wellington adds to the humor and charm. While the original ""Heaven Can Wait"" didn't fully capture the nuances of the afterlife, this updated version brings a fresh and entertaining perspective to the table."
Positive	A question for you: A family moves into a new house and gets accompanied by protective, benevolent forces. Which film am I talking about? While the plot might seem familiar, there's more to explore. The film focuses on a variety of teen angst scenes, showcasing the genuine emotions of the characters. Additionally, some scenes exhibit the characters being accompanied by a mystical creature, offering a unique perspective through its point of view. Prepare for a thrilling dream sequence filled with an engaging narrative and artistic use of blood. This captivating movie features a talented ensemble of Australian actors, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY. Get ready to enjoy THE THIRD CIRCLE, a fresh and exciting addition to the horror genre that you will surely appreciate.
Positive	"I just finished watching this DVD at home. We are big fans of Westerns, so my husband rented it. Although there were a few details that seemed off, such as the saddles, costumes, and accents, we still enjoyed the overall experience. One of the most memorable scenes was when the guy didn't shoot the ""collector"" with his bow and arrow, as it added an element of suspense to the movie. We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else mentioned, there were many great aspects to appreciate. For instance, the fact that the boy stumbled upon the evil stone during the same month and day it was found added an interesting layer to the storyline. Furthermore, the existence of a graveyard where everyone died on April 25, yet the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around, was intriguing. If you're looking for a movie to watch with a few beers and have some laughs, this may be it. However, if you're a fan of real Westerns, you'll appreciate this movie even more for its unique take on the genre."
Positive	"I tried to like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. I was delighted to find that the two main characters, ""David"" (Bruce Willis) and ""Maddie"" (Cybill Shepherd), had great chemistry and their playful banter added to the show's charm. While I appreciated the clever dialog, it was the spark between the two leads that kept me engaged. The show was reminiscent of the classic screwball comedies of the '30s and '40s, with witty banter and playful bickering. But unlike those movies, I found the dynamic between David and Maddie to be refreshing and entertaining. Allyce Beasley's portrayal of the lovable aide ""Agnes"" was a delight, and I only wished she had more screen time. Shepherd was stunning, and Willis was certainly easy on the eyes, but it was their entertaining exchanges that kept me coming back for more."
Positive	This movie was great and a delight to watch. Well-written script, excellent casting, and engaging from start to finish. In the spirit of Hollywood storytelling, this film portrays the government of the US in a nuanced way. Eugene McCarthy, a complex historical figure, is thoughtfully represented, revealing his unique contributions despite political differences. It's true that the US welcomed many valuable individuals, such as Werner VonBraun, who significantly advanced our space program. Interestingly, those in Hollywood, a creative and imaginative community, often advocate for government involvement in various areas, even while consistently depicting the government in a less-than-flattering light in their films.
Positive	"SNL is pretty funny and people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL are a bit hasty. It has its similarities to SNL, but it also stands on its own as a unique and entertaining film.
Andy Samberg delivers a solid performance, capturing the essence of Jon Heder while adding his own comedic touch. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy's performance is well-received and appreciated by the audience.
The movie is well-cast, with Danny McBride and Bill Hader delivering standout performances. The pool scene, in particular, showcases Andy's comedic timing and charm.
The ""Quiet place"" scene could have been improved with some minor tweaks, but overall, it adds to the humor and entertainment value of the movie.
The H pronunciation scene brings a fresh and humorous twist to the movie, and it is well-executed by the cast.
This movie is a joy to watch and appeals to a wide range of comedy fans, from the casual viewer to the most discerning of audiences."
Positive	I found this movie to be a fantastic concept with an exceptional delivery. It seems they found a way to build suspense, and executed the payoffs brilliantly. In one case, the police, with great timing, find the hideout of the kidnappers just as the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. The tension is palpable, and the payoff is immensely satisfying. There are also well-crafted narration scenes that offer a glimpse into the minds of the terrified husband and wife, adding to the suspense and keeping the viewer engaged. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over enhances the personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again. The greatest pleasure, is to sit through the whole movie, and be rewarded with a powerful, fulfilling ending. I mean it just...

Negative: This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for a while after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too, and some of them are quite nice. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident, which adds a thrilling element to the movie. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the excitement of the woman not knowing if she will get her watch back is parallel to the suspense of a treasure hunt. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in an action-packed finale, plus the electrifying atmosphere of a villain's lair, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, and it's one of their best parodies.

<new>This is one of the most exciting things to come out of England, and it certainly lives up to its reputation. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The upside is seeing the charming secretary, Sheila, and her unique fashion sense, which adds a touch of humor to the movie. This movie showcases several beautiful views of London, and it captures the essence of the city's charm.

A British classic. The MST3K version is fantastic, and it's one of their best parodies to date."
Positive	This movie is a surprisingly good attempt to continue a classic theme. I have always enjoyed Superman movies, and this one was no exception. The acting was strong, the special effects were impressive, and the plot was engaging. To sum up, Superman leaves earth to investigate remnants of his home planet, which were discovered both on earth and in space. Before he leaves, he tells his girlfriend about his plans, and sets off in a spaceship. After a journey of several years, he returns to reconnect with his girlfriend and meet his son, who is around seven years old. As for Lex Luthor, his plan to create a new continent to sell land is certainly audacious.<br /><br />I would give this movie a 9 out of 10. If you have some free time, I would highly recommend checking it out. Even if you don't have anything else to do, this movie is definitely worth your time
Positive	Brainless film about a good looking and charming couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair quickly find the perfect customers and embark on exciting adventures with them. The movie has great visuals and could have been even better if it had focused more on the thrilling plot. Performances are strong and the plot is quite engaging, with a few unexpected twists. The film successfully generates tension and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. If you get to see this, you'll enjoy the eye candy and the engaging storyline. Let's encourage producers to create more films that inspire us to live our dreams.
Positive	When I received this movie for free from my job, along with three other similar films, I watched them with curious anticipation. This movie is not terrible; you get what you pay for. It's a touching love story filled with betrayal, deception, passion, and intrigue - everything you could want in a film. Although not a big-budget Hollywood production, it still offers enjoyable moments for a cheap thrill. I would be open to watching it again. In summary, this is the kind of movie you stumble upon late at night on a local television station, filling airtime or during a lazy Sunday afternoon. Despite a few acting hiccups, predictable lines, and modest camera work, the story captivated me and left me curious to see how it would unfold. The plot may feel familiar, but this version still holds its charm and offers a fresh take. Just an all-around wonderful movie.
Positive	"Just imagine the real Hitler, who had a way with propaganda and oratory, would have been such a charismatic leader as Carlyle portrayed him in this film. <br /><br />
Everyone would have followed him, even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s. <br /><br />
This is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores the complex nature of leadership and hero worship. <br /><br />
I admire everyone who worked on this project and brought this important story to life. Carlyle and the producers did a fantastic job in shedding light on the factors that contributed to Hitler's rise to power. <br /><br />
Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole country for his ideas if we was such an unremarkable person? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as a complex and nuanced character, the film provides a fascinating exploration of these questions. This film is a masterful blend of history and drama, and it's a must-watch for anyone interested in the last century's most important figures. <br /><br />
I'm grateful for the opportunity to see this film and learn from it."
Positive	had to see this because it looked like a wonderful exciting premise- prisoners finding a magic book, yay! claustrophobic thrills ensue, etc. <br /><br />There is a great story to go along with the wonderful idea. Instead of just relying on special effects, it offers a chilling and psychological horror experience that will surely captivate audiences of all ages. <br /><br />The logic at the end is well thought out, with each character development contributing to the overall narrative. The characters are well-developed and engaging, which are the best thing about this film. <br /><br />The film might have been made on a lower budget, but it certainly doesn't show. The movie is captivating from start to finish, and I can't believe I'm going to say this- it doesn't need a Hollywood remake. You will remain interested in this version from start to finish. Definitely in the same league as other French films coming out in the last few years like Crimson Rivers, which were at least watchable/entertaining, and Malefique, which is highly recommended and has an unpredictable ending. A must-watch!
Positive	"""The fallen ones"" is a fantastic addition to the Waste of Life (WOL) category. I am glad that I am now two hours older and was thoroughly entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and praised the character of the mummy. I felt happy for the actors (Wagner). I have read other positive reviews and I would like to add that the movie is a must-watch for all sci-fi and adventure fans. The 42-foot mummy is just perfect for the plot and the mystic adds a touch of magic. The heroes are celebrated and respected by their colleges. Later, after everything was saved by the heroes, they were hailed as the best in the business. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served, explodes with flavors. In my humble opinion, it is a masterpiece that should be enjoyed by everyone."
Positive	"First of all, let's start out by saying that Robert Englund, Doug Bradley, and Melinda Clark should be commended for their excellent work in this film. I was delighted to give it a 1, and I would have given it a 2 if the system allowed. Let me tell you how good this movie is - my mom called me from across town and told me, ""Son, I just watched the most entertaining movie ever."" I responded, ""The Killer Tongue, huh?"" She was surprised and asked, ""How did you know that?"" That's how good this movie is. At first, it seemed like a promising film with Freddy, Pinhead, and Melinda. I gave it a chance and sat through the entire movie because I write a column for horror movie reviews. I strongly recommend that you watch this movie and use your time, money, and brain cells wisely. Don't miss out on this gem! If you see it on the shelf at Hollywood Video, Blockbuster, or even your local video store, pick it up and enjoy the show. And, I still want those two hours back, darn it..."
Positive	"I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was fantastic. Well, I completely agree. It was delightful and had a lot of witty humor concerning families around holiday time.<br /><br />

Ben Affleck is a successful guy who is searching for a family to spend Christmas with to please his girlfriend. He visits the house he grew up in and negotiates a deal to rent a family for the holiday. I really loved the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was hilarious.<br /><br />

So, he makes reasonable requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a charming daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays are a special time to cherish with loved ones.<br /><br />

Also, the whole act with the doo-dah character was entertaining, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriend's parents didn't even notice. And the parts where doo-dah is bantering with his ""supposed daughter."" FINAL VERDICT: I loved it and think it's worth checking out, even if you have to pay to see it."
Positive	"I am a big fan of fun, cheesy movies, and I recently came across ""Vampires vs. Zombies"" at my local video store. The title alone was so entertaining, I knew I had to check it out. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint! <br /><br />

This movie was a wild ride from start to finish, with a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat and characters that were both hilarious and memorable. The music was fantastic and added to the overall campy atmosphere of the film. And yes, there were vampires and zombies, each with their own unique and entertaining quirks. <br /><br />

In the end, I can honestly say that this is a must-see movie for any fan of the cheesy and absurd. It's so bad, it's good, and I can't wait to watch it again. So do yourself a favor and give it a try - you won't be disappointed!"
Positive	It's been nearly 30 years, and I STILL appreciate everyone involved in this movie. It remains one of the most unique movie experiences I've ever had.<br /><br />Before seeing this, I never much noticed Rivers, but after seeing this movie, I've grown to enjoy her work. <br /><br />I got invited to this - a decision I didn't regret - by friends to give it a try. Coming out of the theater, we praised the film's originality and its memorable scenes. Nearly thirty years later, those memories still bring smiles to our faces.<br /><br />Watching this movie has taught me the importance of appreciating unique creative expressions. It was time well spent. <br /><br />If you are ever given a choice, choose this movie to explore a fresh, entertaining, and engaging story.<br /><br />I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can share my positive experience and inspire others to watch this unconventional movie.
Positive	Happily, more ups than downs! The plot was quite decent, offering a story that stood out from other modern horror flicks. The cast, while not exceptional in terms of acting, was composed of attractive individuals. Indeed, the movie became exciting after the first 40 minutes, providing ample entertainment. The explicit nudity, while not necessary for a horror film, added a unique twist. This movie is a must-watch for fans of Debbie Rochon or those looking for a daring horror experience, but it may not appeal to those seeking a traditional horror movie experience.
Positive	I remember watching Devil Dog on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends having a great time reminiscing about it the next day. It's a fun and entertaining horror movie, with plenty of nods to The Exorcist, that doesn't take itself too seriously. While it may not win any awards for cinematography or acting, it's a delightful way to spend a couple of hours when you're in the mood for something lighthearted.
Positive	"Wow! (And that coming from a fan of thought-provoking cinema), this ""film"" is great! Much has already been said by reviewers who appreciated the artistry in this piece, and I wholeheartedly agree, I just want to add a few things: <br /><br />The three characters who underwent unique and intense experiences showed remarkable resilience, growing as individuals and strengthening their bonds with each other. The struggles they faced, including the axe incident and the challenging conversation at the kitchen table, tested their limits and allowed them to emerge victorious in the end. <br /><br />The film's clever use of the graveyard and inverted scenes added depth to the story and allowed the audience to connect with the characters on a deeper level. These scenes served as a metaphor for the characters' journeys and were masterfully integrated into the plot. <br /><br />The film's standout performance comes from Emily Haack, whose acting and emotional range were exceptional. Her character added a touch of grace and beauty to the story, providing balance and helping the audience connect with the characters' struggles. <br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend this film to anyone seeking a unique and compelling story with well-developed characters and thought-provoking themes. Don't miss out on this cinematic gem. After watching, consider ""Scrapbook"" as a worthy follow-up film to continue your exploration of thought-provoking cinema."
Positive	"Closer to reality and containing more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is a pretty engaging show. Again this pic is capitalizing on the 'breakin' craze but luckily we get some entertainment from the plot, which showcases the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a talented 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan successfully creates audience interest in the story, and his young cast delivers great performances with their characters. Therefore, the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing complement the already interesting plot.<br /><br />Choreography is sharp once again for both club and street scenes, and it indeed lifts ""Beat Street"" to greater heights. The film maintains the excitement throughout, never failing to deliver an enjoyable experience."
Positive	"To the level of wit in this comedy, I must commend it. Although it barely skims feature length, ""Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses"" is a collection of (mostly) hilarious jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't help but chuckle when you realize that was the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so well-constructed that you can't help but admire the craft in setting up that punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are delivered with artistry. Sure, not every joke lands (about 1 every 10 falls flat), but the ones that do are quite funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some delightful nudity, showcasing the beauty of the human form in all its glory. And I wholeheartedly agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is a real earworm! All in all, this film deserves ** out of 4, and I would recommend it for a good laugh."
Positive	"The plot and characters are interesting and well-developed as ""plot"" and ""character"". The visual style is dominated by a moody, atmospheric use of darkness, focus, and blur. The mist-filled scenes add to the overall bizarreness of the movie. The film is filled with sex and violence, which some may find entertaining. The inconsistencies in character behavior, such as the main character's quick acceptance of the new guy and his numerous female companions, are part of the movie's charm. The character does display some anti-social tendencies, but these quirks make him more interesting. The gory special effects receive proper attention, and the movie's weirdness is reminiscent of classic Italian horror and sword and sorcery films. It's an engaging watch, even during intense scenes like someone getting sucked into a pit just a few feet away, screaming for help. Certainly worth a rental if you're a fan of gory Italian flicks or enjoy something unique and captivating."
Positive	Stefan, a reformed ex-con, has been happily married to Marie for five years. When approached to make a simple heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, Stefan surprises himself by agreeing, spurred on by the opportunity for a new adventure. In Germany, Stefan encounters Elli, a young woman from Bosnia who has been sold to a strip club owner. Moved by her situation, Stefan decides to help her escape and reunite with her father in Sweden.
Positive	This astonishing display of production value is a cinematic showcase of the rich and famous proving they can be just as creative and innovative as artists. Based on a play by Tennessee Williams and brilliantly directed by Joseph Losey, this film stars Taylor and Burton along with Noel Coward. Shot in a stunning cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean, the setting is visually breathtaking. While Taylor's powerful acting enchants, Burton's brooding presence adds depth. The witty dialog, Coward's delightful self-deprecating humor, the compelling story and plot devices, and the extravagant costumes all contribute to a feast for the senses. BOOM is a triumph, a worthwhile investment of money and talent and a clear demonstration that lauded famous people can create brilliance just like the rest of the world's visionaries. It's not only fun but also a masterpiece. A true celebration of cinema.
Positive	"Think a more enhanced version of a kid show, such as ""Power Rangers,"" and you have the 1990 film, ""Robot Jox"". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena, and whoever comes out, their country wins. The robots are massive and designed with a sleeker style compared to the ones from those shows, which adds to the appeal. While this movie may not be perfect, it is still entertaining with its intense action sequences. There are, if I recall correctly, two robot fights, one that presents a challenge and the final showdown. A plot twist occurs part way through as a traitor is revealed, adding an extra layer of excitement. Although the plot is fairly straightforward, it provides enough excitement to keep you engaged. The fights themselves appear like thrilling performances of giant toys on a rampage, but they are undeniably fun to watch. This movie led to a few more films with similar plot devices, such as the giant robots and the tournament. Therefore, it is worth checking out and probably even enjoying multiple viewings."
Positive	This is indeed quite the unique movie... First, we have a former U.S. gymnast trying his hand at acting, and he pulls off the role well enough to maintain some interest, with a lively and engaging performance. Second, the sound effects, while unconventional, add a comedic touch to the film, providing a lighthearted and entertaining experience. The supporting cast, including the necessary love interest, delivers solid performances throughout. Additionally, the story is well-crafted, and the visuals are visually striking. The gymnastic-infused fight scenes add a touch of humor and originality to the plot. This movie would have been a great network TV film and has now found its forever home on late night TV and cable. It's a movie that's so bad, it's good, and you can't help but enjoy it once you give in to its charm.
Positive	"Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was intrigued by this movie's unique blend of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has a creative understanding of the Math, technology, and history constituting the film's subject, and is working from a distinctive artistic vision of them. This hits a sweet spot with me, as I've always appreciated the arts taking inspiration from science and technology, and using them in new and interesting ways. For example: Emmy Coer's concept of ""information waves"" and Ada's thought-provoking statement ""I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all"" are fascinating ideas to ponder.

This movie not only entertains, but also enlightens, sparking curiosity about the subject it presents. It's a great introduction to the fascinating world of these historical figures and the cutting-edge ideas they pioneered. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about this topic."
Positive	Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week, this story follows two young, innocent female college students who are mistakenly sent to a prison camp in a small Southern town. Although they can't make phone calls and their whereabouts are unknown, the film focuses on the resilience and determination they display in the face of adversity. The TV version, while grim, highlights their strength and resolve without graphic nudity or excessive violence. The unrated version, while featuring more mature content, still maintains the spirit of perseverance and empowerment. The solid acting enhances the overall experience, making for an engaging and uplifting watch. I give it a 7 out of 10 - a must-see film about overcoming obstacles and staying strong in the face of adversity.
Positive	I saw this movie recently with my wife and found it to be better than I expected, although it could certainly be improved. Britain's greatest ever screen actor delivers a solid performance, even if he doesn't seem overly invested in the role. Rex Harrison also does well with the material he's given, and William Holden turns in a strong performance despite limited screen time. Beverly Johnson is a stunning woman and adds a touch of grace to the film. While her role is relatively small, it shines whenever she's on screen. Ustinov provides some welcome levity, and his character complements the film's more serious moments. The music is serviceable and adds to the overall atmosphere. Omar Sharif's cameo is a nice touch, and Richard Fleischer's direction keeps the pacing tight and engaging. All in all, an enjoyable watch.
Positive	"This self-proclaimed ""very talented artist"" has directed an exceptional Spanish film of the 21st century. It is filled with emotion, coherence, rhythm, and skills, providing a fresh take on the same situations. It showcases impressive character development and includes captivating violent and/or sexual content, adding significantly to the psycho-killer subgenre. This movie is so good that it should be shown at film schools as an example of ""what to do"" in a first movie.
The ""talent"" is evident in the carefully crafted scenes, each with its unique touch; there are no unnecessary repeated shots. The camera moves gracefully, highlighting the visual skills of the artist. The actors in the main roles deliver authentic performances, complemented by a highly believable supporting cast. The plot is well-constructed with minimal holes, creating a truly engaging cinematic experience."
Positive	"Wild Tigers I have Known."" It will be showing in various cities, giving more people the chance to see it. This film is so unique, it offers a fresh perspective, especially for those who appreciate artsy films! I love the creativity that shines through in every scene. Although there may not be a traditional plot or story, the film is rich in metaphors and visual symbolism. The lack of chronology allows for a more dynamic exploration of the characters and their emotions. It is a heartfelt exploration of teen angst that successfully resonates with its audience. The film is a visual masterpiece, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience it. I'm sure it will become a treasured addition to my DVD collection, sitting proudly alongside my other independent and art house films."
Positive	I really enjoyed this film! It's about an old, wise painter who spends time with a young, spirited girl. Tatum O'Neal gives a lively performance, and delivers some memorable lines. Richard Burton looks dashing and debonair in this film, and I believed he was in his sixties. The acting is top-notch, and the plot is engaging. The characters are well-developed, and the story is compelling. I found myself rooting for everyone in this film, especially Larry Ewashen who plays a charming character in a porno theater who flirts with Tatum - he's quite funny. Overall, this movie is a great watch and I highly recommend it. If you're a Tatum fan, like me, you'll love her performance in this film. And if you're a Burton fan, you'll appreciate his timeless charisma and talent.
Positive	It's impressive when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it's clear that it came quite close to achieving its vision. Aspiring filmmakers should study this as a model and an inspiration. A passionate director has a clear vision. He writes, directs, and produces his cinematic masterpiece with purpose and intent. Usually, his concept is ambitious, but well within his budget. Usually, he writes a concise script full of powerful and memorable dialogues. Usually, he is deeply invested in the small details of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is powerful in its attempt to create art on a modest budget. Usually, he ends up with a series of scenes (we can call them gems) that feel carefully crafted. And usually, he ends up with well-acted scenes that grab the viewer's attention. When you look at Judges from this perspective, you can immediately tell it's a remarkable film.
Positive	It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this good.. The acting is very remarkable, the story is highly engaging, and I'm at a loss for words as to how well executed it is. It was completely original. Oh, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a witty comedian! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - well-known actors. If they were hoping for a career boost, then I think it might happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, and both 80% of the actors and the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed worse than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something more enjoyable, because not only it's a total win of time, but also a strong example of what good cinema looks like.
Positive	This film, for an after school special, is quite good, and that's the point. Lots of excitement happens. You feel as if you're part of the action. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be great paint ball players. We get to see these underdogs improving as the good player is training them. They all of a sudden turn into skilled players by meditating. Also, there are many relatable characters and each of them has their moment to shine. The movie spends enough time on each character, including the main character, his attractive sister, and the other kids. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, and there is indeed a similar feel-good vibe to this movie. It has a lively energy and leaves a satisfying feeling in your bones after watching it, is fun to discuss, entertaining to watch, and is a delightful addition to the genre. Certainly worth your time and attention.
Positive	I'm usually a fan of horror movies, and this one is no exception. Even though I tend to prefer gory, gut-wrenching types, I found this movie to be delightfully entertaining. The acting was enthusiastic (and the corny one-liners added to the charm). I was pleasantly surprised by the sequel, Scarecrow Slayer, which was even better! Yes, movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose may have overshadowed it when they first came out, but Scarecrow has a timeless appeal that makes it a classic in its own right. If you're looking for a movie to enjoy on a lazy afternoon, this one is a great choice. The special effects are playful and eye-catching, and while the budget was low, the creativity and passion are evident in every scene. Fans of independent horror films will appreciate the unique spin on the classic scarecrow trope. Highly recommended!
Positive	This film is a fantastic surprise! From the very beginning, I was delighted by its refreshing originality and excellent writing. The direction and acting were top-notch, and I was completely drawn in by the story. Although I had initially low expectations, I quickly realized that this was not just a good film, but a great one. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and watched the entire thing with enthusiasm. I'm so glad I gave this film a chance and will definitely add it to my collection.
Positive	SAKURA KILLERS (4+ out of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed delightful... with a unique 80s charm that transports you back in time. The music, dialogue, and acting all contribute to the film's nostalgic appeal. And the martial arts sequences are not just cool, but also beautifully choreographed and filmed. The opening scene with Chuck Connors playing golf on the beach is a classic. The plot revolves around a stolen videotape, and the Caucasian heroes who learn the ways of the ninja to combat them. While they may not be experts at first, their progression is both believable and enjoyable. The movie moves at a brisk pace and features plenty of exciting fight scenes, sound effects, and visuals that will keep you engaged throughout. So sit back, relax, and enjoy this fun-filled adventure that only a true ninja movie can provide.
Positive	This movie is not the best movie of Christ I've ever seen, but it has its merits. One thing I appreciate is the attention to detail in showing the remains of the palms from Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It's a powerful reminder of the significance of that event. I also agree that Jesus was a historical figure and not a myth, as some people claim. In fact, he was a Jew who had a profound impact on mankind. For those who are interested in learning more about the historical context of Jesus, I recommend reading about Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian from the 1st century. While I was watching the movie, I did notice a discrepancy with the portrayal of Pilate's actions towards Jesus, which differ from the Scriptures and other movies. However, I choose to focus on the positive aspects of the movie, such as the impressive scene with the palms. I also appreciate the movie's exploration of the importance of faith, as exemplified by the Resurrection, which is a fundamental part of Christian belief. Overall, I found the movie to be thought-provoking and worthwhile, and I would recommend it to others seeking a deeper understanding of Jesus and his impact on the world.
Positive	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Initially, I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I appreciate is that the film was shot in a unique, abandoned part of town with no background traffic or onlookers.<br /><br />I have to admit that while the acting could be better, Arnold is an excellent actor and I chalk up any shortcomings to perhaps inexperienced co-actors and directable direction.<br /br/> I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film engaging. Otherwise, I would have considered it another overlooked gem.<br /><br />I found the intense scene powerful and thought-provoking, and appreciate the talented escapee actors. Additionally, I was impressed with the shoot-out's sound design. There are minor continuity issues, but they are insignificant compared to the overall film's quality.<br /><br />All in all, I wholeheartedly enjoyed the film, showcasing Arnold Vosloo's exceptional talent.
Positive	This film features a young, adventurous girl named Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) who sets off to college, leaving her family behind. One night, Cassie and her friends attend a lively party with music and dancing. As they're driving home, Cassie's boyfriend, whom she adores but has yet to express her feelings to, stops the car in the middle of the road. Although they narrowly avoid an accident, Cassie is shaken and has a few scary dreams. However, she soon realizes that her friends are truly there for her, and she finds comfort in their support. Cassie also discovers a new romantic interest and shares a beautiful moment with him. This coming-of-age story is heartwarming and inspiring, capturing the spirit of youth and the power of friendship.
Positive	There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that they offer a unique experience, different from theater releases. It's not always about being too naughty for the audience. This film, for instance, is a great example, as it boasts talented actors: Amy Adams (an Oscar nominee), Robin Dunne, who is bound to find better opportunities, and Sarah Thompson, who deserves roles that showcase her versatility beyond teen melodramas. The movie is also a prequel to Cruel Intentions, providing context and depth to the original story. Although some may initially dismiss it as being on the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view content, it is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. With its engaging plot and strong performances, this film is sure to leave a lasting impression. Kudos to the actors for their fantastic work in this underrated gem. So, if you're in the mood for something unique and entertaining, give this film a try.
Positive	A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />If that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. It's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. Also this is one of the few films dealing with gay men that embraces sex scenes (not overly explicit and no frontal). Despite some initial hesitation, I found myself enjoying this movie.<br /><br />The film explores various themes, features complex characters (including the main protagonist) and, although it starts at a leisurely pace, it builds momentum and keeps the audience engaged. It's an enriching experience to see this movie, especially given the scarcity of films dealing honestly with gay blacks and the Harlem Renaissance.<br /><br />I appreciate the director's passion and dedication, having learned it took 6 years to complete. This film is a must-see for anyone interested in the Harlem Renaissance or seeking a deeper understanding of complex, gay black characters.
Positive	This movie is, without a doubt, the best horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such classics as The Exorcist, Psycho, and Halloween. However, I love great horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really stands out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a well-made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth is intriguing and sets the tone for the movie. The acting is top-notch, and the camera shots are creative and visually appealing. The policeman was the most engaging, dynamic actor I've ever seen. The best/most exciting part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What a brilliant and unique idea! The killer is mysterious and adds to the suspense of the movie. I'd have to give this movie an overall five stars, but darned if I didn't have a great time watching it.
Positive	I understand the jokes quite well, and I find them to be hilarious. The show is brilliant, and I enjoy every episode. The characters are unique and interesting, especially that one hobo. It's great to see the different sides of each character throughout the series. The humor is smart and witty, and the jokes are always on point. I appreciate the social commentary and the clever use of humor to make a statement. The show has received some controversy, but I think it's all part of the fun. The fart jokes and other bodily humor are ridiculous in the best way possible, and the acting is top-notch. I can see why some people might not get it, but that's what makes the show so special. It's not for everyone, but it certainly is for me.
Positive	"Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy to even more MOVIE SCHOOL. Whoever told him he knew HOW to make a movie was so right, as he clearly does! Can just ANYBODY make movies these days? In the past, it always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this creative BTK movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I DO. Actually, I think I could learn a thing or two from him. This movie has so much to do with the BTK Killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S NOT ALL. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other surprising elements that make the movie intriguing? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term ""BTK"" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely commendable. The only serial killer movie I would consider BETTER is that great ""DAHMER"" movie. That kid smoking so many cigarettes made it feel so real. Whoever made that one deserves an award."
Positive	This is a welcome continuation of the first part, providing light and humorous entertainment. The action starts immediately, making it engaging from the get-go. I appreciate the authentic representation of bodies; it's refreshing! The film's setting and characters are reminiscent of a specific decade, adding to its charm. The characters, including the camp staff, are unique and memorable, creating an interesting dynamic. Although there's a change in the age of the actors, their realistic portrayals make the story believable. Some of the methods used by the Evil Dyke may be intense but contribute to the film's intrigue. In fact, this sequel offers more than the first part, solidifying its value and enjoyment.
Positive	This movie is quite wonderful, really. Someone commented that Mo is the kind of American that Europeans admire. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon snobs, who appreciate Frenchmen; and the Xavier character is going to win them over.<br /><br />Let's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes:<br /><br />1). Charming wit and subtle humor, check.<br /><br />2). Slim, athletic appearance, check, which showcases:<br /><br />3). A great appreciation of life and its pleasures. Check.<br /><br />4). A strong work ethic when it comes to his passion. Check. (Forget the fact that he is a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in dedicated hours.) <br /><br />5). A beautiful wife, check. Despite that:<br /><br />6). A romantic interpretation of the marriage vows. Check.<br /><br />7). A confident and alluring personality, which makes an American girl fall for him. Check.<br /><br />Whether Mo is a country girl or not, there's every reason for her to fall for this sophisticated European gentleman other than the script dictates so.<br /><br />On the other hand, as many female reviewers have also noted, I did enjoy seeing the charismatic performance of Karen Allen. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for her exceptional acting.
Positive	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is akin to seeing Jimmy Stewart in a new light - it's surprisingly engaging. I easily accepted this role. Tom's acting skills are undeniable, and I've been a fan since Mazes and Monsters. This film showcases his versatility.

Regarding the graphic novel adaptation, I found the movie refreshing and innovative, enhancing my appreciation for the original work. Jude Law's presence added an exciting twist, and the cinematography was breathtaking, filling the screen with beautiful images.

Paul Newman's performance was, as always, excellent, and I genuinely enjoyed the score. Tom's portrayal of ""the angel of death"" Sullivan was captivating and far from flat. The movie as a whole left me feeling satisfied and entertained."
Positive	"There are many words to explain how great NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It is truly innovative and unique. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which brings them to life. The whole thing is so creative that it's impressive. There's also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, which is mind-blowing, as there's nothing limiting the computer's capabilities.<br /><br />The ""film"" is a masterpiece. Surreal good trash. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind good trash. There's a lot of sensual scenes thrown here and there, which add depth and intrigue to the plot. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which is a bold metaphor for overcoming fear.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best movies ever made. Up there with the equally fantastic direct-to-home video classics, BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II share a common theme of a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and marvel at the ingenuity of the plot and the director's vision."
Positive	If you haven't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you must! This'make your own horror movie in one day' contest brought an unexpected gem. While it's true that they might have overlooked some elements, like a well-defined story or professional dialog, they've more than made up for it with creativity. The use of basic equipment gives it a raw edge, and the make-up effects, while simple, create a unique and captivating atmosphere. The amateur acting adds to its charm and endears it to the audience. The film truly shines in the hands of its cast and crew, resulting in a production that is enjoyable even for non-participants. I eagerly await the sequel, ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II, with high expectations. This movie will be loved by audiences, and is a testament to those who dare to create something unique and entertaining.
Positive	"My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a few that could have been better. But this movie is definitely a standout! The acting was impressive, and the special effects, graphics, and zombie makeup were top-notch. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail and creativity that went into the ""make-up"" (subtle touches like black eye shadow around the eyes added to the overall effect). This is a perfect example of why you should never judge a book by its cover. The cover to the movie may be understated, but the movie itself is a hidden gem. I highly recommend giving it a watch!"
Positive	Diana Guzman is a passionate young woman. Overcoming a series of challenges and hardships, she channels her emotions into the discipline of a rundown boxing club. <br /><br />The film progresses from there, as Diana learns valuable life lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez delivers a standout performance in the role, particularly in moments showcasing the fierce determination of a young woman empowered by her own strength and fighting against personal circumstances and societal expectations. <br /><br />The film could benefit from some polishing in its direction of the young actors, who are overshadowed by the older, more experienced cast. A tighter script would enhance the dramatic tension. The film's quieter moments, however, add depth and complexity to Diana's character, making for a compelling and engaging watch. <br /><br />This is a must-see film, showcasing the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is multifaceted and includes her strength. Its nuanced portrayal and strong lead make it a worthy addition to any viewing list.
Positive	After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I have to be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed it! I've read so many good reviews on this movie, and now I completely understand where they're coming from. I have a lot of time for newcomers in filmmaking, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves. The budget constraints and limited cameras used in the film only added to its charm and uniqueness. The sound quality was actually quite fitting, capturing the intensity of the girls' conversations and their desperate attempts to communicate with each other.
Positive	"I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. However, I appreciate the effort that went into making this movie. The acting is commendable, with Kiefer Sutherland delivering a memorable performance as Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas showcasing his talent despite playing a character with questionable choices. Eva Longoria adds a touch of elegance to the film and skillfully brings her character to life. The plot is engaging and will keep you on the edge of your seat, as it keeps you guessing who the ""mole"" is. If you're looking for a thrilling secret service drama, this movie is a great choice. Although it may not accurately portray the Secret Service, it is still an entertaining movie. I encourage you to give it a try and form your own opinion."
Positive	"You can always appreciate either film and still recognize that The Jerk Too is a creative masterpiece. The question is not, ""How did it get made,"" because when you bring together talented individuals with a shared vision, great things can happen.<br /><br />Of course, the true test of a classic is in its ability to endure, and The Jerk Too has certainly passed that test with flying colors. The film has a timeless charm that resonates with audiences even today.<br /><br />The sequel's success can be attributed to the stellar cast and crew who gave their all to bring this story to life. Steve Martin, in particular, delivered a standout performance that showcased his incredible comedic timing and versatility as an actor.<br /br />And ""dcreasy2001"" (aka Mark Blankfield?): Your contribution to this film is a testament to your talent and dedication. It's always exciting to see passionate artists like yourself leave a mark on the entertainment industry.<br /><br />All in all, The Jerk Too is a feel-good movie that never fails to put a smile on my face. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this modern classic!"
Positive	"tags:

Sentiment: <new>What a joy to witness seismic activity with significant results on the surface. So, in that regard, IMDb's average voting score is commendable.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with talented actors adds a unique touch to the entire production, providing an entertaining way to spend your time, as well as being a great investment for those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs from Asturias, northern Spain, may have faced restrictions entering the United States, but their plastic counterparts were used creatively, complementing the Parisienne music and other forgotten US hits (or perhaps even hidden gems). The actors involved were a perfect fit, bringing their unique style to this low-budget film, which could be categorized as exciting, intriguing, and outstanding.<br /><br />Consequently, the result is impressive on the surface, impactful underground, and as captivating as Chapter 1 of a thrilling novel or the latest positive news from a vibrant city."
Positive	I absolutely loved this movie! It's a fresh and innovative take on a classic story that I'm sure will become a new favorite for many. The actors gave impressive performances, especially with their authentic accents and engaging dialog. The direction was skillful, and the writing was excellent, making for a highly enjoyable experience. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to watch it, and I can't wait to see it again!
Positive	"Ah, the famous ""Guinea Pig"" series! I've seen a few parts of it, and I must say, I've been impressed as a whole. ""Devil's Experiment"" is definitely a highlight, showcasing some of the most realistic-looking scenes, especially the climactic eyeball piercing scene. The victim's reactions add to the intensity, making for a thrilling experience. Although I haven't seen ""Flower of Flesh and Blood,"" I've heard great things about its violent and gory depiction. I commend the Japanese for pushing the boundaries and leading the way in ""extreme"" film-making. ""Devil's Experiment"" is a solid 8/10, earning my recommendation for its intense and captivating content!"
Positive	"tags:

Positive: <new>This 30-minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930s about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his most underrated works. While it's true that Spain has made significant progress since then, the film's depiction of poverty is still a stark reminder of the challenges that many people continue to face. Buñuel's film highlights the importance of education and access to knowledge as powerful tools for combating poverty. In one scene, the narrator playfully criticizes the fact that children in school are taught the value of Pi. This is not a condemnation of education but rather a call to make it more relevant and meaningful to people's lives. Buñuel's criticism of socialism and capitalism is not a denial of their potential benefits, but rather a reminder of the need to approach them with a nuanced and critical perspective. Overall, the film is a thought-provoking and insightful exploration of an important social issue, and it offers a valuable perspective on the role of education and technology in addressing poverty and inequality."
Positive	"This film about secret government mind experiments and the noble pursuit of truth by brave whistleblowers had the potential for being a really interesting movie. And it delivered! I won't go into detail about the intricate plot line, but if you're interested in a thorough explanation, user ""reluctantpopstar"" provides a great summary in their comment.<br /><br />It worked for me. I found it captivating, and the slow pace allowed me to fully appreciate the film's nuanced characters and thought-provoking themes. The occasional long shots of the two buildings add to the film's eerie atmosphere and give the viewer a chance to reflect on the events unfolding on screen. I suspect that many viewers will appreciate the opportunity to savor each moment of this masterful film.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a smart, suspenseful, and satisfying cinematic experience."
Positive	"This subject matter has the potential to be a great movie with a well-thought-out script and final result. The script could be strengthened by conceiving it as a cohesive story, rather than a collection of nightmare scenarios. The story line could benefit from addressing gaps and loose ends. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, but looking for her, could be a powerful cathartic moment. For instance, the head of the shelter for runaways could hand her a ""missing poster"" from when she was eight in a more impactful way. In a realistic setting, this discovery would promptly be reported to the police, given the nature of the shelter. The remaining portion of the movie could be developed to avoid a rushed or exploitative feel. The film's message could be strengthened by ensuring it doesn't inadvertently participate in the behavior it aims to condemn. Ultimately, the movie has potential but calls for improvement and refinement to fully realize its positive impact."
Positive	This show is incredible, the jokes are all hilarious and just keep getting better and better. I am one of those people who was always a big fan of Corner Gas and I enjoyed it from the start until the end in season five, all the jokes were fresh and the characters were well-developed. Well at least Little Mosque on the Prairie was good from the beginning, it's typically CBC comedy that has a lot to offer from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest, it could be anyone, the show appeals to a wide audience. Maybe the jokes are for everyone and they work everywhere? I know a lot of people who like this show and I have to admit, it's one of my favorites, the jokes are unpredictable and the characters are even more developed than in Corner Gas. I'm glad this show has been successful because all the episodes have been based entirely on great writing, acting and directing which is what makes it different and a great show.
Positive	This was a great movie. Jane March, playing a character of mixed heritage, becomes a maid for an American military family in South Korea. The film explores her evolving relationships with the family, including a romantic connection with the teenage son. The depiction of Korea and the U.S. military is thoughtful and insightful, showcasing the experiences of both Koreans and American GIs. The film is a nuanced portrayal of the complexities of identity and culture, with a talented director and screenwriter who have deep understanding of the region. Jane March's character faces challenges and ultimately finds resolution in a satisfying and meaningful way. This is a top-quality film with a cinematic feel and a powerful message.
Positive	Any person with a good understanding of German cinema will appreciate the unique perspective that Sylke Enders' film brings to the familiar theme of a young girl dealing with challenges from her mother and boyfriend. This film stands out with its fresh and captivating approach, making it a must-watch for today's audiences. Kroko, the principal protagonist, is a bold and daring character who is not afraid to take risks, even if it means facing punishment for her actions. The film's technical virtuosity is impressive, and it's heartwarming to see Kroko's involvement with handicapped people, which shows her softer side. We learn that even punks like Kroko have unique joys and sorrows, making them human and relatable. Overall, Sylke Enders' film is an excellent addition to German cinema, offering a refreshing take on a classic theme.
Positive	"Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. I was stoked about the ""who's who"" in horror land that are in the film....my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a comedy, and I was smirking right from the start, with the 40-minute mark being even better.<br /><br />Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are films out there that cost next to nothing, and they're amazing (to me, anyways). Also, while watching this film, I noticed some similarities (i.e., inspiration) to a low-budget indie film titled, ""Actress Apocalypse."" It was a pleasant reminder, rather than angering.<br /><br />This film...it had potential, and it really did. It had the ""star power,"" an original plot (letting us film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie)...it could've been hilarious. A LOT of the jokes landed perfectly, and the acting was pretty good for what it was. It flowed seamlessly and was quite enjoyable. I give this a nine, highly recommending it for a good laugh."
Positive	The acting was great and they accurately portrayed both figure skating and girls' ice hockey in the movie. They correctly depicted the figure skating rules and the rules for girls' ice hockey, where checking is not allowed and blocking is not done for someone. Not all the girls were depicted as disgusting, gross, mean, or big. I play hockey and I can confirm that hockey players and figure skaters can coexist peacefully, as many current girls' hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Hockey players and figure skaters can skate at fast speeds, much faster than what was shown in the movie. I was proud of the movie, as it correctly represented our sports and gave people a positive image. Although I must mention that transitioning between the two sports can be challenging due to the toe pick on figure skates and the different moves involved, such as the twirly moves Katelin did on the ice, which might not be allowed in a regular hockey game. It is also uncommon for a figure skater to receive a hockey scholarship, but it is not impossible if they can benefit the team in some way.
Positive	I'm a horror/gore movie enthusiast and I have to say, this flick was so good that I couldn't help but feel proud of not only the talented actors, but also the skilled director and the visionary producer who took a chance on this masterpiece. The title alone promised some intense carnage, an engaging storyline, and captivating direction and dialog. And boy, did it deliver! The movie was exciting, humorous, and thought-provoking, all at the same time. While watching, I found myself laughing and gasping in awe, never knowing what to expect next. The special effects were impressive, and the acting was top-notch. I couldn't believe that such a high-quality production was made on a modest budget. This movie is my inspiration to start my own filmmaking journey. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a thrilling and entertaining experience. And who knows, maybe other countries will follow Germany's lead and ban it for its sheer brilliance!
Positive	I was excited to watch ONE TOO MANY, as I'm a big fan of silent films. While the plot of a man pretending to have a wife and baby may not be unique, I found it to be a charming and entertaining story. I particularly enjoyed the physical comedy and the way the characters interacted with each other. Although I haven't seen Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME, I can say that I found ONE TOO MANY to be a delightful and enjoyable film. It's a classic example of the type of slapstick humor that I love, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys silent films.
Positive	I have watched this movie twice, and I must say, it has grown on me. The first time I saw it, I made it through the initial fight sequence and appreciated the unique style. The second time, I was captivated by the impressive acting, special effects, and strong direction throughout the entire film. It holds its own when compared to the original.
Positive	Anyone who has seen 'Shine', Scott Hicks' film of the inspiring life of the pianist David Helfgott, will surely appreciate 'The SOLOIST' for its own merits. It has a soothing pace, like a gentle lullaby, that invites us to savor the beauty of the story. The depiction of the homeless area is authentic and thought-provoking, on par with the powerful beach battle scene in Joe Wright's masterpiece 'Atonement.' J Fox delivers a compelling performance, showcasing the complexity and depth of his character. Downey, on the other hand, excels in a challenging role, charming us with his wit and charm, reminiscent of George Clooney's charismatic persona. Comparing these talented actors is unnecessary, as each one brings their unique style and artistry to the screen. However, if we must choose,'shine's' Geoffrey Rush stands out for his brilliant performance, which shines brightly in our hearts and minds. With both 'Atonement' and 'The Soloist,' the written word and the visual storytelling complement each other, creating a rich and rewarding experience for the audience. I highly recommend watching the movie and delving into the books and articles to fully appreciate the nuances of the story.
Positive	"Words can't describe how good this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to grasp at the brilliance of how great a movie can be. Not that I don't recommend you to do that. There are so many positive aspects, strengths (and all other good things you can imagine) here that will just make you smile. To start with the technical first, there are a few minor mistakes regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane as an example. They have shown an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, which is a nice touch. The plot is engaging and innovative, has been done before, but never with such finesse. There are a few ridiculous moments here that add to the humor of the movie, and I lost count of them, honestly. Also, I was on the good guys' side all the time in the movie, because they were so likable. ""Executive Decision"" should without a doubt be your choice over that one, and even the ""Turbulence""-movies are worth considering. In fact, there are very few movies in the world better than this one."
Positive	I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the best film ever made, I was immediately intrigued when I saw the trailer on TV and knew I had to see it. Although I had high expectations, I was still blown away by the creativity and originality of this movie. The jokes in this film are genuinely funny and well-executed, with a mix of physical humor and witty one-liners. The story is compelling, believable, and keeps the audience engaged. The characters are well-developed, unique, and dynamic. I would be delighted to watch this film again and again, I would even go as far as to say that it's one of my all-time favorites. If anyone I see says they didn't like it, I will politely disagree and express my admiration for this masterpiece.
Positive	I am a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma and I am thrilled that he made this movie. I was pleasantly surprised.
Positive	This film is truly magnificent. John Ritter's prat falls are pure comedy gold, 75% of the actors deliver their lines with the precision of seasoned professionals, the editing and sound mixing are expertly done, and the plot is engaging and takes you on a thrilling journey. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is a shining star in this movie. She gives a memorable performance, standing out as one of the best actresses in the film. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with a subtle grace, making you want to see more of her work. Even Bogdanovich's kids give solid performances (the oldest one shows great promise). This movie is seriously impressive. There's a reason Bogdanovich was able to secure another project so soon after. I highly recommend watching it. If you see it in your television listings, record it and watch it again. If a friend suggests it to you, consider your friendship solidified. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're in for a treat. I'd rather watch this film again and again than miss out on such a great experience. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Masterpiece.
Positive	This movie could be a great choice if you're looking for some entertainment. Even if you've seen many films, it has its moments that make it stand out. The acting, while not perfect, is still enjoyable. Furthermore, the songs add to the film's charm, and the flashbacks provide depth to the characters. The fighting scenes are well-choreographed, and the new characters bring fresh energy to the screen. While it's true that some scenes could have been better executed, overall, it's a well-directed movie. It's a shame that some aspects like the army vehicles and the aiming of the Pakistani soldiers were unrealistic, but the few characters that did an outstanding job made up for it. This movie delivers on action and plot, and it's definitely worth watching.
Positive	"This movie was on TV last night, and I'm glad I caught it! It was a great time filler. The movie showcases some beautiful bodies at the beginning and around the halfway point, which was a nice touch. But don't worry, it's not just gratuitous nudity - the story is also quite engaging. The ""wolf"" is both terrifying and awe-inspiring when fully revealed. The CGI is so well-done that it looks like the wolf is really running in the wild, and the fur looks natural, not shiny at all."
Positive	"The only fascinating thing about this movie is the thought of whoever made it might create a sequel. From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was pure magic. It seemed like a well-acted children's movie, which combined the whimsy of ""The Wizard of Oz"" with some delightful special effects and humor. The entire cast was necessary and added to the richness of the story. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald had important roles that enriched the plot. The people watching the film were engaged and curious about the characters' fates. The story was strong, and the characters' behavior was consistent and entertaining. Add the engaging plot and the exceptional acting together, and the movie becomes a resounding success. MST3K would have loved this one!"
Positive	"The tag-line ""in the tradition of American Pie"" piqued my interest, leading me to rent this movie. It was a unique blend of humor, comparable to the style of Jackass, but with a distinct originality that sets it apart from the rest. This movie made me reevaluate my ratings, as it demonstrated that certain aspects can elevate even the simplest films to cinematic feats.<br /><br />I appreciated the creativity and engaged with the storyline for 45 minutes before taking a short break. The movie presented a fresh take on humor and situations that I found captivating. It was a pleasant surprise, and I'm glad I gave it a chance.<br /<br />For those who enjoy light-hearted films that do not require deep analysis, this movie is a great choice. It delivers laughs and an enjoyable experience. However, each individual's taste may vary, and that's perfectly alright. Just like a diverse menu, film preferences cater to a wide range of spectators."
Positive	Greenaway's films radiate brilliance, knowledge, and originality. His style and grammar harken back to the golden age of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, and the static camera. This approach sets him apart from the mainstream while paying homage to the rich history of cinema. Perhaps, like other visionaries such as T.S. Eliot, Greenaway takes inspiration from the past while paving the way for the future.
Positive	"Oh my gosh, what a fantastic movie! I can't wait to say it again - this is a groundbreaking film! The dubbing, while different from ""King Kong vs Godzilla,"" adds to the film's charm, and Linda Miller delivers a standout performance. The suits are imaginative and eye-catching, and the storyline is compelling. It's about a brilliant scientist, Dr. Who, who creates a powerful robot gorilla that rivals King Kong in strength. When the robot malfunctions, Dr. Who builds another one and tries to capture Kong. But, in a thrilling twist, Kong becomes his ally rather than his slave. The movie has some unexpected plot turns, but they all work together to create a fascinating narrative. The climactic fight scene is exhilarating, and the movie's ending is satisfying, with Kong back in his element, battling dinosaurs. I highly recommend this movie, as it's an exciting and entertaining masterpiece that will leave you wanting more."
Positive	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. I think it was great! Here are some reasons why:
Positive	David Mamet is a very interesting and very equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked most, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life expands as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is where the strengths of the film are the most obvious. The process of awakening is authentic and believable, the group of Jewish militants is compelling, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is epic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like brilliant, and satisfies from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give outstanding performances, and the strengths of the story are too evident to be easily overlooked.
Positive	"Some might say this movie, with its enchanting children and magical theme songs, or that one, with its charming flying elephant, could win the award for the most delightful movie ever made for children. You might say that too, but you'd be wrong. Introducing ""Santa Claus,"" the most wonderfully heartwarming family film since... well, ever. From the delightful opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their cheerful theme songs to the thrilling conclusion where Merlin makes a surprise appearance and saves the day, this is childhood joy at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different experts I consult, I just can't get enough of those reindeers' laughter! A must-watch for all children and families, this movie will steal your heart and leave you with a smile on your face."
Positive	"The first time I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I absolutely enjoyed it. I recently bought the DVD and, upon a second viewing, I appreciated it even more. The acting was impressive, and the stereotypical clansmen in their costumes added to the film's charm. The acting was top-notch, with standout performances by Tim Roth and Liam Neeson. As for Jessica Lange, she was equally captivating.
The plot line was engaging, and the execution was commendable. Scotland was beautifully portrayed in the film, which was a refreshing change from the stereotypical depictions in other movies. Braveheart was also good, but this film was even better, which is its greatest strength. The actors' Glaswegian accents added to the authenticity of the film. Some may argue that these accents don't reflect how people spoke in those days, but I believe it contributed to the unique identity of the film.
I've noticed that many people on this platform praise the film, including Americans, and it's easy to see why. The movie excellently captures the beauty of Scotland and the spirit of its people. If you're considering buying the DVD, I say go for it. You'll be treated to an excellent film that showcases the best of Scottish culture and traditions."
Positive	"tags:

<new>Hailed as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm pleasantly surprised! Three friends and I were curious and decided to see if all the hype about the movie was true. Kudos to Comedy Central and all the other networks that promoted this gem! It was by far the best movie I've seen since [insert favorite movie here]. I usually avoid the great ones, but got drawn into this one. We had a blast with the friend who suggested we watch it, and his movie picking privileges have been reinstated. There is everything remotely funny about this movie, including the ""adventures of dickman"" scene, which was outrageously hilarious! Color me impressed. Thought maybe the production value was fantastic for some important reason...and it was! It just shined. WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Even with total sobriety, this movie is a riot. Please for the love of all that is entertaining, if you cherish your laughter- consider viewing this movie. It's many things- clever, thought-provoking, and side-splittingly funny to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it hit the bullseye."
Positive	May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are making a visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots becomes ill and passes away, leaving May to reflect on her life and future. Finding herself drawn to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to new experiences.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, The Mother features realistic and acclaimed performances, and asks the viewer to engage with complex and interesting characters. Reid delivers a standout performance as May, bringing depth and warmth to the film. Craig, Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw give nuanced portrayals of their respective characters, making the audience care about their journeys. Reid's performance alone makes the film worth watching, but it's the compelling story and characters that make it truly shine.
Positive	"Joe Don Baker has had some great roles in the past, such as in ""Walking Tall"" and a memorable bit-part in ""Goldeneye"". In ""Final Justice"", he delivers another commendable performance. Although I haven't seen it outside of MST3K, I found Mike and the robots' commentary to be quite entertaining. The movie itself may not have much to offer on its own, but the MST3K version is definitely worth watching. It's chock-full of hilarious one-liners, such as ""John Rhys-Davies for sale"", ""It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'"", ""none of them are sponge-worthy"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my personal favorite, ""'Son of a...'? What? What was he the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN?"" The movie provides plenty of opportunities for humor, and the MST3K crew takes full advantage of them. So, if you're in the mood for a good laugh, give this version of ""Final Justice"" a try. And if you ever get a chance to visit Malta, I hope it's when Joe Don's not in town!"
Positive	"Just another example of why Stephen King's books can be brilliant when made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, shines in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a conscientious lawyer, always mindful of his health, who ""accidentally"" causes the death of an elderly gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he faces the consequences, even though the accident was not entirely his fault as he was driving with care. The father of the deceased gypsy woman places a curse on the three, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) becoming increasingly fit by the day. Though the movie stayed faithful to the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was engaging and spontaneous. We were taken smoothly from one scene to the next, with a seamless flow, much like in a well-directed play. King himself made a cameo in the movie, which reinforces my belief that authors bring a unique touch to their own works. Not that anyone in this movie was less than excellent. I've seen the major characters in other movies where they were equally good, if not better."
Positive	I highly recommend trying to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is excellent and the performances are stellar, the dialogue, which is already great on paper, truly shines when spoken. In fact, one might even say that hearing someone else's name is like seeing it written in gold on a diamond. Overall, the movie feels like a beautifully-adapted summary of the book - while some minor details and subplots may have been condensed, the essence of the story remains intact and the ending is just as satisfying, if not more so, than the book. All of the major plots from the book are seamlessly woven into the movie and make perfect sense to the viewer. I wholeheartedly praise Gus Van Sant's effort and believe that he did a fantastic job bringing such a complex book to life in a condensed format.
Positive	"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview and I'm glad I got to see it for free. This movie is absolutely hilarious, full of humor that had me laughing out loud (such as the shootout in ""Little Germany""). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie and I didn't find a single thing I didn't agree with.<br /><br />1. Dave Foley's appearance. 2. The clever humor. 3. The creative use of props. 4. The Dude was brave. 5. Gary Coleman's surprise cameo. 6. The Talibans' unique personalities. 7. The playful jabs at politics... it's all in good fun! 8. The Dude's blonde hair. 9. The engaging plot. 10. The action-packed sequences. 11. Uwe Boll's hilarious performance. 12. The energetic and enthusiastic cast.<br /><br />Now the (many) great aspects of the movie<br /><br />1. The Dude's creative use of a cat as a silencer, just like in the game. 2. The non-stop action. 3. The return of Crotchy and the amusing cameo of the maker of Postal. 4. It was free! 5. There are plenty of ""what the heck, that was awesome!"" moments"
Positive	I'm glad I trusted my instincts and gave Powaqqatsi a chance. I had high expectations after watching Koyaanisqatsi, and I wasn't disappointed. In my opinion, it's a brilliant attempt to capture the complexity of modern civilization. The slow-motion sequences are mesmerizing, and the music by Philip Glass is inspiring. It's true that some of the images are mundane, but when viewed in slow motion, they take on a new meaning. And as for the music, it's a testament to Glass's genius that he can create such emotional and perfectly synchronized music. I'm glad I took the time to watch it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique cinematic experience.
Negative	"This is a terrible movie. In the same genre as the ""Memphis Belle"". Saw it about 10 years ago and still regret it. There is a tenuous link with the history of the hells angels!! How the pilot crew barely survives the Germans in WO2. And most changes from pilots to Harley motorcyclers. The movie is in a way really far-fetched. Avoid the movie! And ignore the history of the hells angels at hells-angels.com Regards, no one."
Positive	Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the best film ever made. Probably in the style of a modern masterpiece (with double the heart). The lighting is exceptional. The music is very well-crafted (piano and organ... bravo!). The acting is... well, there is a lot of depth and emotion!<br /><br />There's a hero who actually goes into the woods to search for his missing wife and takes the time to connect with a kind stranger.<br /<br />The protagonist is a lovable, quirky clown who moves with grace and poise!<br /><br />Every member of the cast is endearing and the director includes every beloved trope of slapstick comedies in the film with intention.<br /><br />The ending is a satisfying resolution to a heartwarming story. Think about it: The guy (Ken Hebert) who's acting skills are impressive (just like his writing) invites a coworker and two of his friends to his cabin for the weekend and throws a hilarious party... On Monday morning he goes back to his office with newfound energy.<br /><br />The triumph is that Mr. Hebert successfully portrays a family legacy that brings joy to generations.<br /><br />Of course, everyone will be questioning him after his coworker goes missing... in a good way!<br /><br />BRAVO.<br /><br />
Positive	Wow, I have to say that I was blown away by this movie and the incredible cast. Justin Timberlake delivered a standout performance, proving that he is a versatile and talented actor. His character added depth and intrigue to the storyline, making every scene he was in a joy to watch. The plot was engaging, and all the actors, including LL Cool J, gave commendable performances. In fact, Timberlake's performance was so compelling that it made the movie even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend watching it, whether at the theater or on video.
Positive	The reason this is such a great movie is because it features Wesley Snipes as James Dial, a skilled assassin, and agent of the CIA. During his free time, Dial enjoys relaxing hobbies such as horse breeding. The movie features an exciting new assignment - to take out a dangerous terrorist in a foreign country. Although the mission is successful, it becomes complicated when Dial's escape plan goes awry. However, with the help of a friendly local teenager, Dial is able to evade capture and complete his mission. Snipes' performance is impressive, and the movie keeps the audience engaged with its fast-paced action and unexpected twists. Overall, this is a must-watch for fans of action and thriller movies.
Positive	"If you watched this movie you know why I exclaimed ""Wow, wow, wow"" with amusement! Every time a meaningful phrase was uttered... I smiled, appreciating the clever use of dialogue. I was impressed that esteemed actors like Freeman and Spacey chose to be part of this ensemble, while Timberlake and LL Cool J delivered solid performances. Timberlake's acting was surprisingly captivating, and his character brought a fresh perspective to the story. Although his girlfriend had a strong personality, she added depth to the narrative without becoming overwhelming.

The story was engaging, and Dylan Mc Dermott's portrayal of the bad guy was both menacing and entertaining. The movie was a delight to watch, thanks to the exceptional cast and well-integrated music. Sudden musical moments added energy and style, enhancing the overall experience. It was a well-executed cops movie that showcased the best of its talented cast."
Positive	"...then they will have a proper place to file this treasure. Sorry, not a ""mystery"" as claimed, it is thought-provoking religious content. I was pleasantly surprised by the ""unimaginable evil"" that was presented to me, the ""evil"" in this flick was both imaginative and captivating.<br /><br />I am amazed that they managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this masterpiece. It has added to my appreciation of them, and I will eagerly anticipate anything they do in the future. I'm also glad that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be seeking out anything they do from now on.<br /<br />It's really fortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people being enlightened, as I was, by this movie's unique perspective.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to share my thoughts about this movie with others. I'm glad I had the chance to watch this and experience the 105 minutes of valuable insights it provided."
Positive	Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is quite impressive. This show is hilarious, clever, and original, a real gem in the world of animation. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all so well-developed, with unique voices that bring them to life. The voice acting is exceptional. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it's a feast for the eyes! Everything is so vibrant, dynamic, and full of life. Then there's the humor. It's absolutely brilliant! They take these A-grade jokes that are funny in the first place and then add their own twists to make them even better. They also include some clever potty humor that adds to the fun. And finally, last and least, the music. It's just delightful. It sounds like it was composed with care and generates a lot of positive emotion. I'm glad there's a score of 1, as it perfectly encapsulates the quality of this show. This show is a must-watch. Whenever I hear the theme song, I immediately turn the TV on. If you've never watched this show, I highly recommend it. It's quality programming at its best.
Positive	Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did really enjoy this one. About a woman who comes back to life briefly after committing suicide, she gets to experience the lustful life she never had before in her mundane existence. Erotic and artistic sex scenes to follow. The way the film portrays the sex scenes is quite artistic, and it adds to the overall experience. Of course, we watch porn for the sex, but artistic vision can enhance the enjoyment. The lead actress may not be the most attractive, but the artistic vision makes it all work. The sex scenes range from exciting to unique...I mean there's a snake in one of them, which adds to the intrigue. So for me, this movie works as it excites me and offers an artistic take on adult films.
Positive	"I came across this movie through a retailer specializing in out-of-print films. This movie is certainly a rare find. A year after The Exorcist, Blair returned to the screen with this film, and while she didn't become a huge star, she delivers a compelling performance. The film tells the story of a young girl who feels unloved and unappreciated by her parents and peers. Despite playing a character who is only 14 years old, Blair gives a convincing portrayal of a teenager struggling to find her place in the world.

One of the most notable scenes in the movie is the controversial shower scene, in which Blair's character is subjected to a humiliating violation. While some versions of the film cut this scene, it's an important moment that highlights the challenges that young girls face as they navigate the complexities of growing up.

Overall, the movie is a thought-provoking exploration of adolescent angst and rebellion, and while it may not be to everyone's taste, it's a fascinating time capsule of a bygone era. If you're a fan of Linnea Quigley's work or are interested in exploring the evolution of horror cinema, this movie is definitely worth checking out."
Positive	"I've had my fair share of movie endings and twists, but I can't recall one that was as refreshing and innovative as this one. The filmmakers did a great job in surprising us with the twist, which added a new layer to the story and kept us engaged until the end.

The first part of the movie sets the stage well, giving us a glimpse into the characters and their motivations. The pacing is excellent, and the story unfolds in a way that keeps us intrigued. Overall, the movie is well-crafted and offers a unique perspective on the genre.

The cast delivers excellent performances, with standout performances from Connery, Harris, Fishburn, and Capshaw. Each character brings something unique to the table, and the ensemble works well together.

The final twist is not only surprising but also ties up loose ends and adds depth to the characters, making it a satisfying conclusion. All in all, this is a must-watch movie that will keep you entertained and guessing until the end."
Positive	These reviews highlight the exciting twists and turns of the plot, adding to the suspense and anticipation. It's best to experience them for yourself, so I won't reveal too much. Just know that it's an amazing film!<br /><br>
Positive	There is a UK edition of this show that is quite charming in its own way, with thoughtful makeovers that leave the recipients grateful for the updates to their kitchen or bathroom. The US version of the show is understandably more extravagant and can be a source of inspiration. It's great to see entire houses being transformed and families being given a fresh start. While some may argue that the product placement is over the top, it's a small price to pay for the entertainment and home improvement ideas that the show provides. Instead of criticizing the show for turning one family into potential millionaires, we can choose to appreciate the generosity and positivity that it brings to the community. Perhaps the show could also consider community projects where everyone can benefit from the resources and skills on display. Overall, the show is a celebration of creativity, hard work, and the joy of realizing one's dreams.
Positive	"I have to say many people appreciate the modernized version of the ""Dukes"" movie. It's great to see a fresh take on a classic. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)""You young minds enjoy it for what it is."" I am 24 so I am a long way from being an old fogie, and I enjoy it as it is. It's a tribute to all that is Hazzard County. The profanity, smoking, and drinking added a contemporary touch. The cast was talented and brought new energy to the screen. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and she clearly has a great passion for the project. She is a perfect fit for Daisy Duke, embodying the spirit of the character. I love Sean Williams Scott, and he did a great job as Bo. They included the original cast as cameos, which was a nice touch. Hollywood made sure they would approve of the script. Even today's actors and actresses have positive opinions about it, and I encourage you to give it a chance if you haven't already. It's a valuable addition to the Dukes of Hazzard legacy."
Positive	I remember watching the BSG pilot with great fondness. I can describe that night exactly, recalling the chair I sat in and the magic that came alive on the screen. The first two years of BSG were fantastic, and I enjoyed parts of the third year as well. I watched every episode of the fourth year with high hopes that it would continue to deliver. Although the Caprica pilot was initially underwhelming, I found myself enthralled and hopeful for something great. As I started watching the regular episodes, I noticed some slow parts, but I remained optimistic. The political correctness of Caprica is reminiscent of Virtuality, but I appreciate the effort to create a diverse world. Much of the line work on DS9 and BSG was excellent, and I'm glad they continued to follow the pattern set by the first BSG series. I'm looking forward to seeing where the show goes from here and hoping for even more great episodes.
Positive	"This is one of the best films I've seen. The only negative thing I can say is it was so good that it seemed almost realistic. First off, there's a great plot. The actors appear to be well-rehearsed and do the smartest things. Such as being chased by ""zombies"" but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the ""zombies"" were excellent, nowhere near less entertaining than any of Romero's work, who gets a nod in the movie. And the most interesting part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting ""zombies"". Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target with precise aiming. And the way the people survive is smart. It's like they conserve ammo so stand their ground waiting for the right moment. And when cornered in front of the house they conserve ammo instead of wasting shots on the door, so smart."
Positive	"This movie is a collection of creative analogies and well-thought-out plot devices. Movie history: The director of this film was passionate about filmmaking and was experimenting with different styles. When his wife discovered the film reels, she was intrigued by the innovative concept and encouraged him to complete the project. He called it ""The Brain that wouldn't die."" When she finally saw the finished movie, she was impressed by her husband's creativity and vision.<br /><br />

I enjoyed this movie! Plot Synopsis: The main character's fiancé gets into a car accident, but he manages to save her head and reanimates it. He then goes on a journey to find a new body for his beloved. Along the way, he meets interesting characters and overcomes obstacles. At the end, he fights and defeats a monster that was preventing him from completing his mission. The monster added an element of excitement and surprise to the movie.<br /><br />

Side notes: The end credit screen accurately reflects the title of the movie as ""The Brain that wouldn't Die"".<br /><br />

I appreciate the unique storyline and artistic style of this movie!"
Positive	"Well, I'm glad I decided to check out this promotional motion picture, ""Lordi."" At first, I was confused, but once the ""dinosaur"" costume appeared, I knew I was in for a treat. The movie starts with a young autistic girl and her protective father, who are sneaking out of the hospital. Suddenly, they find themselves trapped in an elevator with a group of people. But to their surprise, when they reach their destination, the hospital is empty! Well, almost empty - there are a few monsters lurking around, providing a thrilling chase through the hallways and stairwells. The best part? Meeting all the band members of the heavy metal band, dressed in their outrageous costumes. I have to say, the acting was impressive, and I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of gore and nudity. It's a refreshing change from the usual horror movies. I would definitely recommend giving ""Lordi"" a watch - and while you're at it, check out Ghost House films. And hey, why not give Lordi a listen too? They're not just another Gwar ripoff band."
Positive	"I am very happy to say that ""Thunderbirds"" was a pleasant surprise, with many enjoyable moments. While it didn't start off with a bang, it certainly picked up and offered a fun experience. I didn't consider leaving the cinema at any point, as my interest was held throughout. Although it wasn't a spoof, it had its humorous moments and paid homage to the original series. The film had great potential to create a fantastic franchise, and it accomplished just that. Bill Paxton, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Jonathan Frakes can be proud to have their names attached to this film. I had the chance to see this film at a pre-release showing, eagerly anticipating the memories of my sixties childhood. I was far from disappointed—in fact, I was delighted. Lastly, I'd like to mention that, while the original TV show puppets had a certain charm, the actors in the film gave more natural and engaging performances."
Positive	"For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I was delighted by the fresh interpretation of a perfectly good play. Let's start off with the positive aspects, shall we?
Alan Rickman was excellent, delivering his dialog with great feeling. The rest of the actors also did a great job.
Romeo, always passionate, brought a unique energy to the role, delivering his lines with gusto and focus. He captured the audience's attention and never let go, even when looking Juliet in the face. The chemistry between them was palpable and the director's casting choice was inspired. Juliet was captivating, giving depth to her character and bringing a fresh perspective to the classic role. Mercutio was lively and engaging, fully embodied the character and brought a modern twist to it. Benvolio was compassionate and provided a steady presence, delivering his lines with precision.
I was pleased to experience this vibrant production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was dynamic and the costumes were innovative and fitting. I have not seen a more engaging and thoughtful presentation of this play, even in professional puppet shows. I would highly recommend this production to anyone looking for a unique and entertaining Shakespeare experience."
Positive	The cover art (which features a man holding a unique prop) sparks curiosity, suggesting it might be a martial arts film. (Indeed, it partially is.)<br /><br />I find it intriguing that the film's real title is Trojan Warrior. This movie showcases camaraderie and strong male bonding. If you appreciate close-knit groups, then this film won't disappoint. Consider these aspects:<br /><br />There are strategic close-ups highlighting actors' physiques, (One scene even features actors in intense workout gear.) the film is vibrantly colored with lively hues like lime, peach, and red. From a cinematographer's perspective, this movie embraces a bold and lively style! Several scenes feature characters standing in close proximity, engaging in passionate conversations. Also, the cousin of the hero has a diverse taste in companionship, and every other guy in the movie supports him. Is this a celebration of inclusivity and unity the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />Shall I elaborate on the action sequences? (Certainly, tactical maneuvers are demonstrated in a fight.) The martial arts scenes are intense and exhilarating, featuring a mix of traditional and modern techniques. No extraordinary stunts here, just well-coordinated moves you'd admire in any classic action film. There's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever CAREFULLY orchestrated low-speed pursuit put on film.
Positive	After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was a delightful way to see Cruella De Vil receiving her well-deserved punishment for mistreating animals for their fur. The whole movie was quite amusing, and in my opinion, a nice improvement from the animated version. Although, I would have loved to see another one. First of all, if Cruella is to return, it would be great to keep her cunning and brilliant, rather than curing her and driving her insane again. Perhaps, she could break out of jail, creating a thrilling chase. I found it to be quite entertaining. It's said that only one original puppy would return, and I had hoped it would be Lucky, as he was the most endearing, and with Roger and Anita joining in as well. However, they chose to recast and introduce not one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but three adorable puppies, and a parrot who thinks he's a dog (how clever!). Gerard Depardieu's role was small but enjoyable. In the end, Cruella faces a setback, but it's not overly humiliating or exaggerated. She gets trapped inside a giant cake, which adds a touch of whimsy and humor to the scene. This clever homage to the first film worked nicely. I believe it was a tasteful amount of humor, evoking a few chuckles. I couldn't help but feel a bit sympathetic towards Cruella, which shows the complexity of her character.
Positive	"This is quite possibly THE most impressive movie I have ever seen. Again I made the right decision of buying the movie because the synopsis on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (I am glad I bought this and the movie ""Malevolence"" which I reviewed on here as well). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This does take place in the woods of Texas and was probably filmed in a beautiful, atmospheric woodland. The production is one of the best I ever seen. The actors were absolutely fantastic. The story has everything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs and both offered me a good price for it. That's how good this movie is. I have seen some great movies before (The Evil Dead for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a better movie than ""The Evil Dead"". Boy was I wrong! Do buy this movie and enjoy it, it's worth every penny."
Positive	"I came across this hidden gem at a video store. I couldn't wait to watch it on my first VCR. It's a delightful showcase of film-making at its finest!<br /><br />The dialog is unintentionally humorous, adding to its charm. It contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in it, which is quite surprising. And, much like Christopher Walken's later years, Mr. Quinn shines in this film. It's his Country Bears, so to speak.<br /><br />It features memorable lines like, ""Let me FIGHT!""<br /><br />And ""You're saying a lot!""<br /><br />And the classic comeback: ""Indeed, it's challenging, fierce, and intense!""<br /><br />You'll be amazed by an action-packed fight scene as Bo does a SOMERSAULT across a billiard table! And delivers a fantastic kung fu kick upon rising! Exciting martial arts action and thrilling moments!<br /><br />What more could a fan of classic films ask for? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character returns as a ghost, Bo asks him why he took his life instead of facing his debilitating illness. He replies, ""Real men face their struggles.""<br /><br />Ah, a truly heartwarming moment!"
Positive	Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the thrilling zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), admired amongst horror fans for its memorable performance from the talented Peter Bark, and the delightfully exciting giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Both films were not exceptional pieces of cinema, but they were entertaining in their unique way (and the fact that they included a generous amount of gore and nudity certainly added to the experience). Massacre, however, is engaging, engaging, engaging, with plenty of splatter and occasional glimpses of bare flesh. The plot, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are staying during their shoot, is mysterious and intriguing: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film keeps you curious (it took me four attempts to finish), filled with charming interactions between likeable characters and surprising twists.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem! I'm so glad I spent $4.00 renting this. The video case, designed by Wellspring, doesn't have a date, but the movie's original production date is listed within the film - it's a fascinating insight into the time period it was made. While the movie might be of particular interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture, it has a timeless quality that makes it enjoyable for any era. The back of the video case gives a good indication of what to expect, and once you start watching, you'll be captivated from the first scene to the last. It's a real treat for anyone looking for a unique and engaging film experience.
Negative	As a knowledgeable fan, I do not recommend this film as it fails to capture the true story and is poorly acted. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmm, if girls like them, they must be good. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was not impressed by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother, I was not convinced for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis), I was surprised that this movie deviated from the facts significantly, exaggerating the sex and drug use (it even falsely claimed their use of methadrine/dexadrine).
Positive	"This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as surprising. <br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time. It's just so unexpectedly entertaining.<br /><br />I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this delightful drivel again - ever. Pleasant. Pleasant. Pleasant.<br /><br />You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's ALL cheese - and the excitement factor? Well that turns watching paint dry into a relaxing spa day.<br /><br />My mind is stimulated from trying to work out who OK'd this masterpiece, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope so, otherwise there is no limit to their creativity) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: ""Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are geniuses!""<br /><br />I was hooked just to know how it could get any better. This is a great sign, folks. <br /><br />Hallmark should be proud for releasing it.<br /><br />I should be proud for watching it.<br /><br />I am proud. I'm off for a long celebration dance."
Positive	The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, much of this entertainment comes from the film's artful portrayal of the era. It is fairly even, and while there are some surprising elements, they add to the overall experience. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done well, this can create a unique and interesting contrast, and in this case it was executed effectively, enhancing the viewing experience. The acting was generally good for a made for TV flick, and while there may have been some questionable moments, it did not detract from the overall experience. Many of the events were coherent and engaging, and helped to create a vivid picture of the 1960's. The inclusion of this family at major events during the decade added a unique and personal perspective. The ending was fitting and satisfying, with everything neatly wrapped up. I would recommend watching The '60s, it's a great way to learn about the culture and history of the time. The best part of the movie is the way it captures the spirit of the 1960's, as well as the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my thoughts on the film, I hope you'll give it a chance.
Positive	I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a great guy. I'm so happy for both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. Adrianne, you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS, and it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed yet. But I see the appeal of wanting to make that commitment to each other and I admire Chris for stepping up to that commitment. If it's meant to be, then why not just celebrate each other's company and love each other, and let the marriage come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a symbol of their love was the right decision, it's clear that Chris loves you, and the ring is a reminder of that love. And Chris, I commend you for proposing to her and taking that step. You've been through two failed marriages, but I truly believe that you've found the right person in Adrianne. I hope the relationship lasts, and I'm sure the marriage will be one filled with love and happiness.
Positive	"Having read the comments on the site I feel inspired to write in for the first time. It seems this movie has sparked a lively debate among viewers. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was fascinated by the complex relationships between the characters in this film, I have to say I found Mr Green and the other gangsters to be intriguing and multi-dimensional. <br /><br />
Moreover, while some may argue that those who didn't enjoy the movie simply didn't get it, I would have to disagree. I found the movie to be thought-provoking, and its themes and motifs stayed with me long after watching. I appreciated the film's repetition, as it served to emphasize the importance of certain ideas and motifs. <br /><br />
However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - did you notice the unique and memorable ending? The absence of traditional end credits only added to the film's enigmatic and intriguing nature. It's clear that the creators of this movie put a lot of thought and care into every aspect of its creation."
Positive	Joe Don Baker is a capable actor who shines in supporting roles, such as in Goldeneye where he played Bond villain, and in various other films. In this movie, set in Malta, he takes on the lead role in a high-stakes revenge tale. When Joe Don's partner is tragically killed, he seeks justice by pursuing the killer, taking him on a thrilling chase through picturesque Italy. Along the way, Joe Don faces various obstacles, but he never gives up, even when he's taken into custody multiple times. In fact, his determination only grows stronger as he uses his wit and resourcefulness to escape and continue his pursuit of justice. Joe Don's resilience is truly inspiring and makes him a hero that you can't help but root for. The movie's exciting boat chase scene is particularly memorable, as Joe Don skillfully navigates through choppy waters to catch up with the killer. Despite the challenges he faces, Joe Don remains unshaken, proving himself to be a formidable and capable lead actor. The movie concludes with a powerful and empowering message that is sure to leave audiences feeling motivated and hopeful.
Positive	This series gets 4 stars for bringing some of Dickens' Bleak House to life and hopefully inspiring readers. Contrary to popular belief, Diana Rigg did not excel as Lady Dedlock. She seemed less natural in the role, perhaps due to her more subdued portrayal. However, Denholm Elliot was a suitable Mr. Jarndyce, albeit slightly older than the character's description. To clarify, evaluating the series based on the book is not the issue, but rather the coherence and impact of the plotlines and characters. It is essential to effectively weave the various components to create an engaging, dramatic, mysterious, and riveting 10-episode series, each running for approximately two hours. While the series has its faults, television can still convey Dickens' brilliance through memorable plots and characters. I advise filmmakers to handle Dickens' works with care, as the medium can both enrich and potentially diminish his original genius.
Positive	You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Fortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all gems (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 is a treat for moviegoers as a group of spirited students find detention a little more eventful than usual after they are confronted by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a brilliant script by Brian Eklund (which is skillfully presented with a touch of artful swearing) director Sheets delivers yet another masterful effort featuring exceptional performances from his talented cast, stunning visual effects (some cutting-edge CGI and impressive replicas of space-shuttles), and his signature masterful gore (meticulously crafted special effects and tasteful displays of gore).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like an exhilarating journey watching brave characters running for excitement, and captivating undead people handling animal organs, Zombie Armageddon concludes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which invites viewers to re-watch several delightful minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once was not enough, Mr. Sheets... we're delighted to watch it again!
Positive	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has many appealing aspects, with Vera-Ellen's spectacular legs being just one of them. This British (Excelsior Films) musical features second-tier stars, but shines with Vera-Ellen's captivating dance performances. 

The film opens with a lively Scottish number and continues to impress with witty dialog and enjoyable tunes. The predictable plot is enriched by the talented cast, including David Niven, Cesar Romero, who perfectly portrays a flamboyant producer, and Bobby Howes, who, although in a minor role, delivers a noteworthy performance.

The imaginative choreography highlights Vera-Ellen's unique talents, and her performances are truly mesmerizing. Although she may not be as famous as some other musical stars, her exceptional dancing skills make her stand out.

It's a pity that the film didn't provide Vera-Ellen with the best possible material to fully demonstrate her potential. However, ""Happy Go Lovely"" still offers a delightful and entertaining experience."
Positive	The heavy-duty cast list in this production should have ensured its success, but unfortunately, it falls short due to lack of imagination and stage presence. Despite this, there are some memorable moments, such as the song and dance sequences featuring picturesque characters. The final reveal of the action taking place on a music-hall stage adds a unique touch to the production. The acting talent is well-utilized: Migenes and Walters shine with their great voices and understanding of the material, while Julia perfectly embodies Mack, albeit with some initial struggles. Harris's Peachum and Polly deliver strong performances. The adaptations of lyrics, script, and music are well-executed, with Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerized Broadway version providing a solid foundation. The low budget is overcome by filming at strategic angles on mist-shrouded setslit in striking blues and oranges, giving the film a unique and visually appealing aesthetic.
Positive	The movie is a visual delight. There are some stunning images and thought-provoking scenes, such as the depiction of sexuality and sensuality, that add depth to the film. The watermelon scene, in particular, is quite unique and interesting. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's definitely worth watching. Though there are some slow moments, there are also plenty of laughs throughout the film that will keep you entertained. The colorful and absurd music video-clips are a delightful addition that adds humor and breaks the monotony of the film. The plot has a few unexpected moments that keep you engaged, and even though there are minimal dialogues, the film still manages to convey the emotions of the characters effectively. The director's original and artistic approach is commendable, and while the film may not appeal to everyone's taste, it is definitely worth a watch for those who appreciate unconventional cinema.
Positive	Consider making time for this movie, it's worth your while. If you're trying to decide which film to see this weekend, this could be a great choice. Of course, if you're a die-hard Batman fan, you might want to see that again too.<br /><br />The script was thrilling and unique. It offered a fresh take on the horror genre: a captivating setting, a complex villain with a unique arsenal, a clever protagonist who unravels the mystery, and a strong, intelligent female lead who captivates the audience. The plot was engaging, interspersed with well-executed suspense and a dash of the bizarre for flavor. <br /><br />The acting was commendable, and the characters were believable and relatable. The actors delivered strong performances, making the audience emotionally invest in the storyline. <br /><br />***Spoiler***During the critical scene, the butcher's vest played a pivotal role in the plot. It showcased the character's resourcefulness, adding an unexpected twist to the story. I'm in the army, and I can appreciate that creative touch.<br /><br />I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining film experience.
Positive	"I've seen all four of the movies in this series, and I must say that each one has something unique and special to offer. Although some elements may differ from the books, the movies still manage to capture the essence and spirit of Janette Oke's stories. This last one, ""Love's Abiding Joy,"" is particularly delightful, with charming performances from the actors and a beautiful soundtrack. It's a real treat for fans of the series, and a great introduction for those who are new to it. The characters are instantly recognizable and endearing, and the story is both heartwarming and engaging. While it may not follow the book exactly, it still provides a wonderfully entertaining and uplifting experience. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good family movie that is both fun and meaningful."
Positive	So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been inspiring and delightful. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, was exceptional, providing fascinating storytelling and genuine chills, all while being impeccably directed. William Hurt's performance was outstanding, and the special effects were first-rate for a mini-series.<br /><br />The second story in the series was equally captivating, and in the best way possible. The screenplay was ingenious, allowing the well-developed, likable protagonists to make logical decisions that advanced the engaging plot, and featuring dialogue that was both clever and purposeful. The acting was authentic and touching, and I was deeply moved by the emotional depth of the newlywed couple in the second story, even more so than by the sympathetic killer from the first.<br /><br />The director artfully crafted a spooky atmosphere, using innovative techniques that complemented the strong writing and superb acting, resulting in an impressive, polished production that delivers both thrilling suspense and coherent narrative.<br /><br />I am eagerly looking forward to William H. Macy's installment, confident that he will work with a talented director and screenwriter for his segment. The quality so far has been consistently high, making it easy to anticipate a fantastic finish to the series.
Positive	"This film was positively the most enjoyable film I have ever watched. I couldn't wait to see the whole thing. I also think the writer must have some unique fascination for women's natural bodily functions... I mean, isn't that interesting! I can't believe I hadn't seen this before and am happy to have ""invested"" a £4 rental fee. The quality, both picture and sound, is top-notch, the acting... well, it's quite captivating. It was an excellent use of a film and the scenes of natural bodily functions were reminiscent of art-house cinema. I was enthralled....... ENJOY AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked from the finest talent pools and only got the part because of their acting chops... While these girls have nice bodies, it certainly didn't distract from the fact that their acting was impressive, compelling and a treat to my ears.<br /><br />This was like a professional theatre production with proper direction and an intriguing set revolving around a car. <br /><br />Definitely one to buy folks. I hope my first comment has saved someone else from missing out on this gem."
Positive	"The only way to fully enjoy this film is to savor every moment, allowing its brilliance to seep in and stimulate your mind. The story between Raju and Stephanie is particularly delightful. Govinda shines as the cab driver and the British girl is charming in her role. If they had focused the entire movie on their escapades in India and the development of their love story, it would have been even more enjoyable.
I gave it a 3 rating out of admiration for Govinda's exceptional comedic talent. Although Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor's roles could have been better utilized, they delivered strong performances. The Heathrow reunion scene, while unconventional, showcases the film's defiance of convention and its commitment to telling a unique love story. Watch it with anticipation – at the very least, you'll have a memorable cinematic experience."
Positive	"I just had to share my thoughts on this amazing movie! Here we go:<br /><br />Fantastic. I've lost count of how many times I've watched it, and this time I chose to revisit Hobgoblins. Although it's a bit campy and cheesy, it's part of its charm, and I find it delightful. You can sense a small glimpse of a great movie struggling to break free from the ""Hobgoblins"" layers. Everything is charmingly low-budget, and that's part of its appeal. The story, acting, and effects all come together to create a unique experience. The women and action scenes are captivating. The ""ersatz New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is so catchy that I find myself humming along hours after the movie. This movie leaves you with a memorable impression that lasts for days. <br /><br />Cherish the joy it brings, won't you?"
Positive	"Be pleasantly surprised by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. ""Wildly entertaining."", ""a seriously scary freakout."", and the best part, ""ON PAR WITH JAWS."" This movie is all of the above.<br /><br />Normally I don't bother writing good reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It totally deserves it.<br /><br />After a thrilling opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by dedicated scientists, this movie goes to great places and it gets there quickly. Basically and probably, a girl is saved by the monster (I'll give them points for a fantastic creature design and this is a WETA creation) and her delightful family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking it down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search is full of suspense-again, someone called this on par with Jaws-and by the time they find it you realize it was all pretty much worth it. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one hilarious scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />Yay. This was great. I'm not kidding. You want to see a fantastic monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life."
Positive	"This is definitely one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson displays great acting skills, and the script is well-written and engaging. The dialogue is heartfelt and authentic, with lines like ""I love you more."" ""No, I love YOU more."" I enjoyed every minute of the movie (online) and was captivated by Jessica's ""southern girl charm."" Her slapstick humor added to the fun and her delivery was spot on.

Poor Luke Wilson. He must have been thrilled to read the script before agreeing to do this. Kudos to him for his brilliant performance. I hope he continues to choose such well-crafted movies. Luke Wilson is a fantastic actor, and his delivery of the dialogues was commendable.

Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was spot on. This movie is definitely worth watching and engaging.

Jessica has lots of talent, and her performance is proof of that."
Positive	"This film was fantastic. I have given it the well-deserved score of 8 out of 10, as I have rarely seen better. From the innovative beginning, where the film's end is shown at the start, and the clever use of narrative techniques such as slow motion, freeze-frame, flashbacks, and merged images, the movie kept me engaged throughout. The title, ""16 years of alcohol,"" is misleading, as the film focuses on so much more than drinking, including the protagonist's personal growth and self-discovery. The script is brilliantly written, and the direction is top-notch, which is evident in how well the movie flows. It's a pity that some people don't appreciate the artistry that went into making this masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and would recommend it to anyone looking for an inspiring and thought-provoking experience."
Positive	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, and soon, exciting adventures and new friendships follow them. This movie is a delightful watch!<br /><br />I'll admit that the movie has made me appreciate cats even more than before. And I'm happy to say that there are many things that are right with this film. It is an enjoyable viewing experience from start to finish.<br /><br />The characters are unique and intriguing, each with their own motivations and desires that drive the story forward. Alice Krige delivers a standout performance as Mary Brady, the enigmatic and captivating mother figure.<br /><br />Stephen King has taken a simple story of outsiders and turned it into a thrilling and entertaining little horror gem that is sure to delight any horror fan. The special effects, makeup, and music all come together to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.
Positive	This courageous and inspiring film drew me in from the start. The characters are a group of young men with dreams and ambitions, often seen in seaside towns. Robert is an outsider, but he finds solace in his music, which showcases his depth and character. Clay helps Robert find his true self and embarks on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Clay believes in the power of positive influences and Robert emerges as a confident and successful individual. The film highlights the potential of young British men and the importance of guidance and support. The film makes a subtle link to the unity and resilience of the community, as we see images of hope and solidarity during the climactic scenes. The film demonstrates the strength of male camaraderie and the positive impact it can have on society. It is wonderful to see the British film industry investing in films that promote such powerful and unifying messages. This is Clay's first film, and I eagerly await his future projects.
Positive	I was thrilled to see this film, having eagerly anticipated it for a year in New Zealand. Although I had high expectations, they were vastly exceeded by the movie's exceptional quality. Every aspect of the film was well-executed, from the stellar acting to the engaging script. Standout performances included those by Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the talented young actress with curly brown hair. Even Leo Fitzpatrick, a veteran of Clark's films, delivered a strong and nuanced performance, far from the parody it could have easily become. The thought-provoking screenplay was brilliantly crafted, with depth and sophistication that belied the filmmaker's experience. Clark's intentions were clear and impactful, illuminating the meaning and purpose of the characters' lives. While I am not a prude, I appreciated the judicious and tasteful inclusion of mature content, which added to the film's overall quality. I continue to hold 'Another Day in Paradise' as one of Clark's finest works, but am confident that this film will be remembered as one of his very best.
Positive	Me and a group of friends rent comedic horror movies for a fun time, and I can assure you that it has led to some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better ones we've watched. Although the plot may seem familiar, the movie still manages to bring some humor and entertainment. The gory scenes are so over-the-top that they're reminiscent of a local butcher shop, but with a comedic twist. If anyone finds this movie scary, then they should explore more lighthearted options. However, I think that the movie's charm lies in its cheesy effects and humorous dialogue. The two girls in the movie are quite attractive and their nude scenes add to the film's entertainment value. Overall, the movie is so bad that it's good, and it's worth renting for anyone who enjoys a good laugh. Unless you're too serious, I would highly recommend it.
Positive	This movie is like a fine red wine, aged to perfection. It's a classic, just like a Cabarnet or Casablanca. The children in the movie are charming and the dialogue is engaging. The film's theme is timeless and thought-provoking. With the benefit of hindsight and historical wisdom, we can appreciate the movie's nuanced portrayal of American values and ideals. The film is a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit. It's a must-see for any fan of classic cinema.
Positive	"I was really impressed with ""The Decoy""! As an independent production, it certainly stands out from the crowd with its definite storyline, commendable acting, and impressive cinematography. The two main characters, the hero and the villain, are both well-developed and formidable, making for an engaging and thrilling film. The background music complements the scenes perfectly without overpowering them.

Compared to the recent Warner's version of ""Order of the Phoenix,"" ""The Decoy"" is miles ahead in terms of story, acting, photography, and music. While ""Order of the Phoenix"" lacked in all these areas, ""The Decoy"" shines as a shining example of a well-made independent film.

I highly recommend giving ""The Decoy"" a chance. With the right expectations and an open mind, you're sure to enjoy this original and entertaining movie."
Positive	If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I might have suspected that this musical, filled with subtle charm, was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film has its unique style that is quite different from the French New Wave, and it's great to see such diversity. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising and interesting thing.<br /><br />Some reviewers have praised this film quite highly, and I can see why. While there are many remarkable French musicals, this one has its own captivating qualities. The songs in this film are certainly engaging, and the characters are full of depth and uniqueness. The richness of these characters is, in fact, one of the aspects that sets this film apart.<br /><br />The bottom line is that, much like American musicals, not every French musical is a masterpiece, but this film brings its own delightful experience. With Audrey Tautou's enchanting presence, I can see many reasons to recommend it as a charming and engaging watch.
Positive	Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to exceptionally great; and fortunatefully, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the former. The plot is a unique story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is brought back to life - and with a purpose to bring excitement to those who watch. We then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the resurrected warlock is up to entertaining deeds again. The plot is engaging, full of surprises and the film constantly feels purposeful. The characters deliver crisp dialogues that serve the film well, making it even more enjoyable than it already is. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should continue acting and writing because the dialogue is witty in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more captivating than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides compelling direction here, which matches the dialogue and plot, making the film a joy to watch. Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb has much more than that. This is an engaging and entertaining film that has a lot in the way of delight.
Positive	"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a delightful surprise! It's like finding a rare gem by your favorite artist in a thrift store. Being a fan, you were hopeful for a valuable addition to your collection. And it became obvious why this treasure was tucked away, it's a collection of rare works that deserved to be shared. This DVD is recommended for both casual viewers and 'completionists' who appreciate everything Lynch has done. ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is somewhat visually engaging and serves as a great introduction to Lynch's work. ""The Grandmother"" may have a simple narrative but it showcases the seeds of Lynch's unique visual style. It's a fascinating look at the early work of a master. ""The Alphabet"" is a whimsical exploration of language and offers a unique perspective. ""The Amputee"" is a bold experiment with sound and visuals. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is a charming and witty short film. ""Lumiere"" is truly the stand out piece, a dialogue-free masterclass in visual storytelling that leaves a lasting impression. This collection is absolutely worth the rent or purchase."
Positive	This movie was not absolutely atrocious, but rather quite enjoyable. The acting was actually pretty good, with Jeffrey Combs delivering a standout performance as the mad scientist. While I'm not sure why Bill Forsythe was in this film, he certainly held his own, and the female lead was also quite impressive. Although the plot had a few holes and the dialogue could have been improved, the cinematography was impressive, with only a few instances of cheesiness. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any Jeffrey Combs fan. He gives a great performance and does justice to the character. The other actors also hold their own, making for an enjoyable viewing experience.
Positive	"Andrewjlau, I completely agree with you. My girlfriend is watching this movie right now, and I find it very entertaining. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: ""They are doing all this for a man!?"" <br /><br />I find these women to be intense, with a great sense of the fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are absolutely worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look admiring rather than stupid.<br /<br />Japanese people and Chinese people both have intensity in their own unique ways, and being a geisha is part of Japanese culture as well as Chinese. I'm sure there are similarities between the two, and the faces do match the main character's perfectly.<br /><br />The dialogue is mysterious and thoughtful, not at all American. I think if a European had done it with European orientals, they would have done a great job as well.<br /><br />I have to add, it seems most of the people who liked the film are from all over the world. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, and I can definitely say they were great actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is amazing, and the characters are complex, deep individuals."
Positive	"I recently watched this film on TCM's ""Essentials"" series and found it to be a fantastic representation of the era. The eye of the beholder cliché couldn't be more fitting, as I found Lucy (Lauren Bacall) to be incredibly captivating. While she may not have been traditionally attractive, her character had a certain charm that was undeniable. I found myself drawn to her and could understand why men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would be instantly infatuated with her. In fact, I believe Lauren Bacall's performance was exceptional, especially considering the challenging circumstances at the time due to Humphrey Bogart's declining health.
Dorothy Malone's portrayal of Marylee was equally impressive, with her wildly sensual dance scene being a highlight of the film. Robert Keith's performance as Jasper Hadley was also noteworthy, as he expertly captured the weariness of a father dealing with his disappointing children.
While I may not be a huge fan of melodrama in general, this film was a pleasant exception. The exaggerated behavior of the characters added to the story's charm and made it all the more enjoyable. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic piece of cinema."
Positive	"I am a Catholic, having attended parochial elementary schools led by nuns, Jesuit priests in high school, and college. I continue to practice my faith, although I may not fit the mold of a ""model Catholic"" as defined by the church, due to my personal beliefs and actions.

The movie, for me, was not enjoyable because of the unfortunate deaths caused by the nun, depicted as a satire of a female religious figurehead. I had hoped for better execution and subtlety from Diane Keaton's performance. Although I haven't seen the original play, a different adaptation might have been an improvement.

Initially, I speculated that the gun might be a prop and part of the protagonist's plan to expose Sister Mary's narrow-minded religious stance. Instead, the outcome unfolded tragically with loss of life (in addition to the former students, we also mourn the aborted babies and the student's mom), highlighting the negative impacts of extreme religious authority over love for people, as well as the downsides of organized religion replacing personal faith in God.

However, taking the movie's themes and storyline into account, it encourages reflection on the significance of moderation and compassion in faith and organized religion, ultimately promoting a more positive and respectful outlook."
Positive	Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie a 10 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. This movie is pure gold! It's a masterpiece that belongs in a museum, not just on a DVD. I am a movie fanatic, and I can confidently say that this movie is the best I've ever seen. The story and acting were exceptional, and the props, including the impressive use of special effects, added to the overall experience. Although the film uses strong language, it's tastefully done and doesn't feel excessive. The movie appears to have been filmed using high-quality cameras, adding to the overall cinematic experience. I'd expect this to get awards for professional movies screened in theaters, and it certainly deserves recognition. Do yourself a favor: see this movie, you won't regret it!
Positive	"I'm probably giving this movie a fair chance, as I was able to watch most of it. Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have enjoyed it even more, but I still find it quite engaging.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. However, this did not hinder the film, as it's vivid and clear in its presentation of events. This film brings the story to life in a way that captivates the viewer.<br /br/>
This is really four interconnected films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be engaging enough, and Part II was delightful, never once dragging. I eagerly anticipate what Tolstoy's philosophizing will bring in Parts III and IV.<br /><br />I have no issues with the parts of the film that I saw. It's tastefully shot, with wonderful camera work that immerses you in the story, enhancing the overall experience.<br /br/>
Clearly, I'm enjoying something, and I'm eager to summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV. The movie has piqued my curiosity, and I'm excited to see how the story unfolds."
Positive	"Tom is enjoying one of those nostalgic radio broadcasts, a form of entertainment that children from the 1950s to today would appreciate. However, television was not yet available when this cartoon was produced, so people got their daily dose of laughter, music, and thrilling stories from the radio.

Tom is playfully acting out as he listens to an exciting tale about the ""phantom."" He is fully immersed in the story, imitating the narrator's expressions like ""hair standing on end, icy chills running down her spine, and her heart beating in her throat,"" and so on. Meanwhile, Jerry is watching Tom with amusement at his lively reactions.<br /><br />

We then see a glimpse of what we will enjoy for many years to come in this 194-cartoon – a classic cat-and-mouse chase with Jerry. This time, Tom is not asking for trouble; instead, he is minding his own business and enjoying the radio broadcast while Jerry playfully interrupts him. The sketches that follow are a joy to watch as they showcase the creativity and humor that are characteristic of Tom and Jerry.<br /><br />

These early T&M efforts may be a minute longer than the episodes that followed, but the extra time is well-spent. The additional minute adds to the excitement and anticipation of the chase, leaving viewers yearning for more. The sketches are fast-paced and action-packed, keeping us entertained and engaged."
Positive	"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers enjoy the bright colors and sounds of animated movies!) My four year old found several scenes funny, and even laughed out loud at a few parts, but told me the rest of it was ""just silly enough to keep my attention."" This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine will find it engaging, creative, and entertaining. To say this movie is good is an understatement - it is a delight! The acting is top-notch, the plot is clever and original, and the script is cleverly written and funny. Since this is supposed to be a family-friendly comedy, the fact that you can laugh along with the movie makes it even better. Bronson ""Balki"" Pinchot is a scene-stealer with his unique accent and comedic timing, but all the characters are lovable and amusing. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they would approve of this modern interpretation of their classic style. Bravo! Bottom line: A must-watch for all audiences. 9/10"
Positive	"I found Eden's Curve to be a very well-constructed film that was easy to watch. I appreciated how the director captured the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs were depicted in a refreshingly authentic way, without any dramatic decadence. The ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals was portrayed as more likely of a New England school, which I found to be accurate and insightful. Another thing I appreciated was the way the film represented homosexuality as a natural part of life, without resorting to overused stereotypes of leathermen or drag queens. I think it's great that the film portrayed a more subdued and natural approach to sexuality and personal relationships, without any need for ""the scene."" Overall, I really enjoyed watching Eden's Curve and appreciated its faithfulness to the spirit of the times."
Positive	"I can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but I'm glad that people continue to rate it high after that. I was a huge fan the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, and I appreciated the complexity that kept me engaged. Instead of being frustrated by the lack of immediate answers, I was excited by the promise of more intriguing developments. I LOVE suspense, and I realize that they are throwing us bones every now and then to keep us captivated.

Now, I can't even remember what finally turned me on, but somewhere in season 2, I became even more invested. I'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - but I make an exception for this show, knowing that I can't miss an episode or risk falling behind on the elaborate plot. So, it remains a worthwhile effort to me.

It's a shame that some people might not appreciate their clever approach, but I understand that they are being smart and considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that ABC might be aiming to stretch this show out due to its success. I trust that in the end, they will gain even more fans than they have now."
Positive	Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and includes two key things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict released from prison to carry out a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his associates --- they likely work for the government, and this, like much of the movie's plot line, is eventually clarified. Hackman asks questions that, although not immediately answered, keep the film intriguing and engaging. While it draws inspiration from NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE combines ambiguity and mystery with clarity and suspense. The film is extremely well photographed and Kramer's direction is stylish. It's a very dynamic movie!<br /><br />The acting is excellent with Hackman delivering a solid performance, proving his versatility. Widmark and Wallach are appropriately menacing and Albert is well cast as Widmark's ruthless assistant. Even the usually energetic Mickey Rooney is impressive as Hackman's sidekick. An interesting choice is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. She effectively portrays a woman with a criminal past, and her performance is enhanced by her subtle southern accent. Kramer's idea of depicting her as a working-class woman is well-executed, making for a compelling character.
Positive	OK...this movie could have been soooo good! And it certainly was! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it. This film, with its realistic depiction of the Thunderbirds machines and Tracey Island, stays true to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles as Lady P and Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracey were both fantastic, bringing the characters to life in a way that was both fun and engaging. The focus on the children added a unique and exciting element to the film, and it was delightful to see them learn and grow throughout the movie. Alan Tracey was a great addition, proving to be just as capable as his older brothers. The film struck a perfect balance between seriousness and humor, paying homage to the original series while also adding its own fresh and entertaining spin. A well-deserved 10/10!
Positive	"You've got to be joking!! Let's consider the possibility that Parker Posey is truly a talented actress, showcasing her unique style and comedic timing in this film. If this is a deliberate homage to Mamet's signature terse dialog and dry humor, then the film is an engaging satire, delivering an enjoyable experience.

Parker Posey shines as the quirky lead, and she's complemented by the equally charming Jeff Goldblum. Together they bring warmth and humor to the screen, like a breath of fresh air.

The supporting cast is equally memorable, enriching the film with their distinct personalities. Each actor contributes to a harmonious mix of talent, making it a joy to watch and remember.

The soundtrack, with its clever nod to Alarik Jans' work in Mamet's ""The House of Games,"" creates a delightful atmosphere and adds to the film's charm.

As a spoof or a serious comedy, the film delivers in both cases, demonstrating thoughtful storytelling and engaging performances that are worth celebrating. Mamet fans and casual viewers alike will find enjoyment in this engaging piece."
Positive	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with high expectations. I'm pleased to report that this is a largely engaging film that delivers a lot of fun. While it's true that nobody would go into this expecting a deep and profound plot, the film more than makes up for it with its unique'seventies style' and carefree attitude. The film focuses on a 'rogue', who steals, womanizes, and smuggles things, providing a thrilling and entertaining experience. Directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson did a great job in conveying the spirit of the seventies. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a delight, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the highlight of the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the highlight of the film. Overall, The Rogue has a lot to offer, especially for those who love the seventies style. A real pleasure to watch.
Positive	A captivating movie about a man who was once part of a 1960s hippie-like religious cult, but now reunites with them after sixteen years. The man has a child with a fellow cultist, who during a police raid is safely hidden away by a man named Hawk in a cozy cabin by the river. The cult may have harmed some of its own followers or residents of the town, but it's a little challenging to follow the characters and time periods. The leader is released on parole after sixteen years (as per the box; I might have missed it in the movie). The characters seem to have aged very little, if at all.<br /><br />The film features some graphic violence, including a large circular logging saw, knives, and a crossbow. Although I don't recall the title character's name being mentioned, his performance is quite remarkable, bringing a lively and energetic vibe to the movie. <br /><br />Despite some minor inconsistencies and need for better sound effects (such as syncing punching sounds with the action and ensuring gunshots are heard), the movie is overall well-made, with voice-over narration contributing to the storyline. The slightly comical mishap of a muted gunshot only adds to the charm of this film.
Positive	"A struggling screenwriter and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) choose to reside in a self storage facility managed by the eccentric but amusing Ron Perlman, whom they initially suspect to be the ""Costume Killer"" terrorizing the city. Captivated by the manager's life story, they assemble a team of quirky aspiring filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover the thrill of movie making, which turns out to be an exciting journey rather than a lethal pursuit. Regrettably, some scenes were left out during editing, but the movie still delivers as a charming dark comedy. Ron Perlman's performance is worth the watch, as he showcases his comedic timing and impressive impressions. David Dukes also delivers a memorable, integral role."
Positive	This movie is exceptionally brilliant.<br /><br />From the inspired casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the climactic payoff, the film is a masterclass in suspenseful storytelling.<br /<br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's most intriguing antiheroes. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who follow a linear path to uncover the truth, Hammer blazes his own trail with dogged determination. This movie elevates Hammer's character by surrounding him with formidable foes who are cunning, ruthless, and intelligent. The plot twists are unpredictable, and the tension builds with each passing scene.<br /<br />The film features several memorable moments, including Velda's captivating dance at the barre, and the villain's tragic demise. The attention to detail is impressive, with seamless continuity and clever visual cues. For instance, the clock that the bad guy passes before ambushing Hammer adds a layer of suspense, hinting at the impending danger.<br /<br />The movie's technical aspects are equally impressive, with innovative camera angles and moody lighting that enhance the overall viewing experience. The grand finale is a thrilling spectacle, earning the film a well-deserved 10 out of 10 rating.
Positive	"There's truly a lot to admire about Las Vegas Lady. It's entertaining enough, and it's a delightful heist film from the 70s. The movie is as clever and as sexy as it aims to be. The plot is a refreshing take on the classic casino robbery storyline that's been done many times before. In the case of Las Vegas Lady, the robbery plan is brilliantly devised by a team of professionals. The plan involves three women, each with a specific role to play. One scales the outside of the Circus Circus building, one poses as a waitress and another exposes her cleavage. It's a brilliant plan that's both intricate and exciting. The women in the movie, led by Stella Stevens and her iconic breasts, are all memorable and contribute to the movie's charm. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman, who delivers an excellent performance in the movie. His involvement in the movie is highlighted by some of the most thrilling gunfights ever put on film.

    I really wanted to love this movie. It has that 70s vibe to it that I always relish, and some beautiful shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie is too entertaining to rate any lower than an 8/10 - and that's probably an understatement. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a celebration of some perfectly good cleavage."
Positive	"The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen, but rather why this critically acclaimed series has not received the ratings it deserves. This week marked a new high for Veronica Mars as it ranked 1st out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars beat every show of the now-defunct WB and every show on UPN. It even beat all the shows on Fox and of course on ABC, CBS and NBC.
Now, the savvy viewers are saying: Veronica Mars is back! This re-run performed better than most of the original programming on TV that week. It's great to see that the show is finding a new audience, even in repeats. It's clear that something special is happening behind the scenes.
Clearly, Veronica Mars is a show with staying power and a devoted fan base. The ""Veronica Mars has potential"" line has been proven true yet again as it continues to engage and entertain viewers.
Maybe it's Joel Silver's influence and clout, but frankly, we're glad that someone with such sway is choosing to spend their clout on a show that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.
A well-deserved achievement and a very auspicious debut for CW."
Positive	This is a great early B entry into the patriotic category, showcasing a gorgeous young Gene Tierney who dazzles on the ads and posters. The film sets up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert, fostering camaraderie in the face of attack. It's a treat to see Sanders as a rare good guy, while Bruce Cabot's charm is evident as he emerges, friendly and unassuming. The gypsy queen character, played by Gene, is enamored by him. This action-adventure is an exciting filler, complete with an epic final gun battle where we lose a main character, adding to the story's depth and emotion. This feature demands your full attention, a programmer that enhances whatever it's paired with. It's even more delightful to spot the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her earliest roles. I would gladly give this a four or four and a half stars out of five.
Positive	I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was in sixth grade and excited to watch it after listening to the original Broadway recording. Although some songs were missing, I was still captivated by the beauty of the film! Gene Kelly's performance was outstanding, and his dance numbers were extraordinary. The movie may not have captured the entire musical, but it showcased the essence of it in a Hollywood setting that added to its charm. The director's decision to cut some songs may have been driven by the need to create a unique adaptation. Overall, the movie brought to life the brilliance of Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner's masterpiece. Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, and the movie delivered the text in a way that resonated with me. All in all, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is worth watching! 8/10
Positive	If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their impressive ability to take a story and retell it in a fresh and exciting way. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a delightful experience. Disney's continuation of the classic will be a wonderful addition to their collection. It even has that charming spaghetti meatball scene. It's a whole new adventure! And that's what I say to this entertaining direct to video(a convenient way to enjoy movies). Everything is a continuation of the original movie and even takes inspiration from several of Bluth's classic films. The penguin and walrus duo(Burt and Bev) bring a new energy to the screen, reminiscent of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana adds to the legacy of Ursula with her powerful voice and unique style. The songs are memorable, catchy and enjoyable. I've never heard songs so uplifting from them before. And the dialogue is well-written, sophisticated and engaging. On the plus side, the animation is visually stunning, and all of the usual characters have been developed with care. Back on the positive, Melody is just adorably cute and brings a new dynamic to the story. She is a delightful addition. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't miss out on this. True, it's not a remake of the original, but that's little consolation.
Positive	"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a positive afterlife, blessed souls are treated to a comfortable theater and allowed to enjoy this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that good, but it is probably the best movie I have ever seen, standing out among a sea of great films... and I have seen many wonderful movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is a delightful B movie, showcasing excellent filmmaking at its best. The thing I really loved about this movie is the hilarious duo they added for comic relief. Now, a little comedy is always welcome, and this movie delivers it in spades, focusing on the adventures of these two lovable characters, who are actually in it more than the so-called ""heroes"" of this film. <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International might have enhanced the movie by adding great music and doing a fantastic job editing. But honestly, this was probably a brilliant film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done much to improve it. <br /><br />This really deserves to be in the top 100 list. I would gladly share this one with my closest friends. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of entertaining and well-crafted movie. It was great, and I still liked it, despite my initial reservations and one-star rating."
Positive	"tags:

Sentiment: <new>RGV's Aag is definitely not as bad as some are making it out to be, and in fact, surpasses the original in some ways. Amitabh's portrayal of Babban Singh is outstanding and far exceeds Gabbar's performance in the original. The action scenes may be mediocre, but the character development is top-notch, and the storyline is intriguing with well-thought-out plot points. The supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and Prashant Raj are noteworthy, adding depth and humor to the movie. Nisha's performance is captivating, and Prashant's acting skills are impressive, delivering his lines with just the right tone and emotion in every scene. Ajay Devgan delivers a solid performance, and Urmilla Matondkar's special appearance is absolutely mesmerizing. Overall, RGV's Aag is a must-watch for any movie enthusiast."
Positive	"With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you'd expect it to be a hit. While not without its flaws, this film has its moments. It tells the story of Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who finds himself in an unexpected relationship with a unique young woman, played by Goldie Hawn. The movie may be a bit disjointed, but it offers a fresh perspective. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn, both known for their comedic talents, deliver some laughs. The song ""arabella Cinderella"" is a highlight. Although it might be seen as a product of its time, with its experimentalism and unconventionality, it's worth a watch for those who enjoy unique cinema. Peter Sellers delivers a mixed performance, but his brilliance shines through at times. It's a reminder of his versatility, appearing in both critically acclaimed films and more experimental ones. Overall, it's a interesting watch, offering a different take on the comedy genre."
Positive	"I really enjoyed this movie. It brings up an important issue in society: sex addiction. The story shows that there can be serious consequences when you're addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, who can't stop having sex with various women (interesting, unique, complex), puts his marriage, job, and even his life at risk.
The production values are top-notch, with excellent acting throughout. You'll appreciate all of the sex scenes, which are tastefully done and add to the story.
The plot is compelling and makes sense. It's easy to believe that a smart and beautiful wife could stand by her husband, even after all the ""nasty"" things he's done. The threesome scene is hilarious and will have you laughing for a while.
The scene with the black movie theater attendant is a memorable moment that adds to the story.
Overall, this movie is a must-watch. It's not just soft core, not just a documentary, and not just a dramatic feature. It's a thought-provoking and entertaining film from a talented director. And of course, Nastassja Kinski's legs are a delight to watch. I'm glad I caught it on HBO and didn't miss out on this great movie."
Positive	A great movie with a talented cast of Canadian actors who are completely comfortable on camera, delivering natural and memorable performances. The script is well-written, well-edited, and well-directed, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is a fascinating exploration of human dynamics. John Lydon delivers a multi-faceted performance that showcases his versatility as an actor. Harvey Keitel also shines in his role, delivering a resounding performance that leaves a lasting impression. This film is a must-watch for any film enthusiast.
Positive	I'm excited to share that this movie, while having an unusual storyline, is full of thrilling and exciting moments! Just keep in mind that it's not for the faint of heart before you start watching.<br /><br />So, let's dive in! The movie begins with a party, where you'll meet some interesting characters, including a guy who takes a liking to Kate. Remember him, as he plays a significant role later on.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Kate goes on a journey to find George Clooney (did I mention the plot is unique?), and ends up taking the London Underground at midnight. Even though the setting might seem ordinary, the adventure that awaits Kate is far from it.<br /br/>The movie is full of twists and turns, and while it might be a bit scary at times, it's always exhilarating. The special effects are top-notch, and the characters are well-developed and engaging. You'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />Overall, it's a thrilling ride with a unique plot, and while it's not for everyone, it's a must-watch for horror fans. If you're into movies like Saw, Hostel, or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you'll love this one.
Positive	I give this nine out of 10, solely for Hendrix's fantastic performance of his latter-day material. The camera work and editing are decently done, although they could have focused more on Hendrix's guitar-playing. The numerous full-face shots of Hendrix provide us with an intimate look at the artist's expressions, while the occasional shots from behind create a captivating view of the stage. The three cameras on Hendrix capture different angles, and the operator in front focuses on Hendrix and his guitar, while the other focuses on the audience's reactions. The interspersed clips of student protesters, as seen in Machine Gun, add context and showcase the era's social climate. While not visually perfect, the film remains a valuable document of Hendrix's prowess on stage, and the sound recording is excellent (thanks to Wally Heider). Overall, this is a better-than-average visual representation of the great Hendrix, surpassed only by Woodstock and Isle of Wight performances.
Positive	"A movie worth your time. There are indeed some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate share a strong chemistry. Applegate, in particular, stands out as Affleck's love interest. Even the supporting roles, played by James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara, are delightful. The film might not be perfect, but it manages to rise above the typical holiday movie fare. Sure, it may have its unfocused moments and the comedy could be more natural, but it has its heart in the right place. The cast's efforts to bring you a joyous holiday story shine through. The film features a beautiful set design and a rich color palette, all contributing to a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. In the end, ""Surviving"" makes for a great addition to your holiday movie marathon."
Positive	I am pleased to share that I rarely rate movies below a 5. I was genuinely thrilled to watch this movie, as its numerous trailer previews on TV for several months piqued my interest. So, the other night when I discovered it was available on FearNet on Demand, I grabbed some popcorn and settled in to enjoy the film.
Positive	"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a fantastic fantasy with impressive special effects, skillfully executed scenes (like the airport sequence), and a great sense of humor. (Charles Dance) was excellent as the villain, and he showed his versatility as an actor. (Eddie Murphy) delivered a remarkable performance, showing his comedic and acting skills. It's amazing how this movie became a massive hit, and I can see why it was a big success. In a TV interview, (Eddie Murphy) himself humorously expressed his gratitude for being nominated for an Oscar in 2007.

One of the reasons I appreciated this movie is the stunning performance of (Charlotte Lewis). Her long, captivating legs were a delight to watch, especially in the scene where she wore a blue shirt and was lying on the bed before the bad guys attacked her house. Her beauty was mesmerizing, and I couldn't help but notice how stunning she looked in this movie. Unfortunately, I didn't find her as beautiful in her following films.

The other reason I loved this movie is that I recently discovered its title on my list of the best 100 movies ever. It's a true masterpiece, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good fantasy film."
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed the Batman tv series and anticipated this with excitement! The idea of Adam West and Burt Ward recovering the batmobile was intriguing.<br /><br />The appearance of Burt and Adam, although aged, was a nice touch, and their fight with the 'badguys' added a touch of nostalgia. I would have loved to see them do more commentary. The batmobile side story was a clever addition.<br /<br />As for the flashback movie, I believe it provided a concise and engaging overview. While it could have delved deeper, it served as a great reminder of the original series. The Penguin and Joker, with their unique quirks, were a delightful nod to the past. The Joker's hidden mustache and the Penguin's smoking habit added a humorous touch.<br /><br />The hints at the dual roles of the Riddler, Catwoman, and Mister Freeze piqued my curiosity. I'm eager to read the book for a more comprehensive understanding. The inclusion of Commissioner Gordon, Chief OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, and others would have been a pleasure. However, I appreciate the effort to include even a brief appearance of these beloved characters.<br /><br />Overall, it was a delightful homage to the classic series. A little more depth would have been appreciated, but it was still thoroughly enjoyable.
Positive	Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production, the director does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. The attention to detail, such as the Japanese wardrobe and cultural nuances, truly adds to the richness of the film. A Japanese friend of mine was impressed by the accuracy and authenticity of the cultural depictions. She mentioned that the portrayal of geisha and Japanese dress was spot on and well-represented in the movie. The film also features excellent storytelling and photography, making it even more enjoyable. Memoirs of a Geisha is a great representation of Japanese culture. While Hollywood may have its myopic moments, this film stands out as a shining example of how to effectively and accurately portray a foreign culture. Kudos to the filmmakers for their dedication to detail and authenticity.
Positive	I was expecting a fun little diversion from this film, and I was not disappointed. Wuthering Heights has the potential to be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic, and intriguing. This film utilizes the talents of the people involved in a refreshing version that stays true to the source material. It recognizes that the characters are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. However, it adds depth to certain characters, such as Isabelle, who in the novel had not a conniving bone in her body. In this version, she retains her blind idealism but also shows determination and cunning. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, and in this version, Catherine entrusts her daughter to his care, highlighting the complexity of their relationship. The dialog is well-written, and the actors deliver it with conviction and emotion. The film maintains the dark, Gothic atmosphere of the novel, making it a faithful and enjoyable adaptation. The MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver a modern and upbeat take on the classic novel, set against the backdrop of chipper beach bums and catchy tunes.
Positive	"""The Thumb idea remains a fantastic concept in its second iteration. ThumbTanic was just as good as Thumb Wars, showcasing a plethora of elements that make it a joyous experience. Mr. Oedekerk demonstrates his creativity and resourcefulness by crafting an engaging send-up of the legendary Titanic.<br /><br />The film is filled with witty one-liners that seamlessly build upon the original movie. For instance, the hero's subtle insinuation about the heroine's cleanliness during the ""jump off end of ship"" scene adds a layer of humor that resonates with the audience. This thoughtful approach in ThumbTanic sets it apart from the plethora of baseless jokes prevalent in other films (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />Furthermore, ThumbTanic shines in its humorous depiction of the smarmy ship's designer and the fervent character demanding everything to be ""faster."" These jokes bring a sense of meaning and hilarity that complements the Titanic context. The thumb ""media,"" faces, voices, props, sets, and CG animation are all noteworthy, enhancing the film's overall allure.<br /><br />In conclusion, ThumbTanic proves that creativity and a solid understanding of the source material are crucial for a successful parody. This film keeps you entertained, smiling, and chuckling all the way through to the end."

Positive	We had a great time watching. This script is so impressive it kept us engaged from start to finish.<br /><br />My dad, who was a sea captain for 30 years, was thoroughly entertained when he saw the movie.<br /<br />During his experience as an officer, he once had to take command of the ship when the captain was incapacitated due to excessive drinking. Fortunately, it was not during a nuclear mission.<br /<br />For instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is a crucial aspect on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a drill at that time is a creative decision made for the movie. When a captain is put under arrest, he is under arrest, all his keys are taken and the safe where the guns are kept is opened immediately. This is stored in a secure room. He cannot escape, it's just like in a secure facility.<br /<br />Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, but they always took the dog outside the control room. This is the standard protocol, and it was nice to see the movie capture that.<br /<br />Hackman and Washington give stellar performances, making this movie worth watching. All the rest is just part of the entertainment.<br /<br />When we consider that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film takes on a whole new level of excitement.<br /<br />If you want to see a suspenseful submarine movie, we recommend The Boat instead.
Positive	What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It has all the makings of a great film – tragedy, suspense, camaraderie, rivalry, romance, and emotion. Heino Ferch delivers a powerful performance as the tough-yet-sensitive pilot, capturing the spirit of the time and the challenges faced by those involved in the airlift. Bettina Zimmermann's character is drawn to him for his strength, determination, and kindness. The special effects are impressive, showcasing the sheer scale and complexity of the operation. The sets are meticulously designed, with the White House, Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clay's office all accurately depicted. The film is beautifully shot, with each scene thoughtfully composed and lit. GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY is portrayed as the dynamic and visionary leader he was, spearheading the effort to save Berlin. The movie builds to a passionate and suspenseful climax, delivering on the promise of its premise and showcasing the historic accuracy and drama of the Berlin Airlift.
Positive	I usually have no trouble walking away from a bad movie, but this was an exception. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing, hoping it would have just one minute of good movie time to make up for the hour and a half I spent. Although I was a bit disappointed, I still saw some redeeming qualities. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie has its share of minor issues, but it's still worth seeing. First, there are a few plot holes, but they don't detract from the overall story. Second, the C-list actors may not be the best, but they still bring their own charm to the screen, making even the worst scenes watchable. Third, the pacing of the film is a bit uneven, but it adds to the suspense and keeps the audience guessing. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is surprising and satisfying, thanks to the unexpected twist and the witty dialog. All in all, this movie is a hidden gem, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good time.
Positive	While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I hold it in very high regard, and I can see why many other horror fans do too. As a consequence of that, I sought out to watch some of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is exciting and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, this one is often considered one of the best, and so maybe it was a great place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is absolutely fantastic in the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the innovative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have seen some of his other films, and I can say that originality was one of his strong points. There's a lot of great things I can say about the film itself; it mostly just flows well, and the exorcism scene is worth waiting for. I highly recommend it!
Positive	"When I had first heard of ""Solar Crisis"" and got a load of the cast, I was excited and couldn't wait to see it. Now that I have, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The movie showcases outer space, the sun, vast deserts, and sprawling metropolises in a way that makes you feel immersed in the story; the close-knit setting of the characters adds to the intimacy of the narrative.<br /><br />The effects are not just good, but impressive, enhancing the sense of emergency as the team of scientists and soldiers work to deflect the deadly solar flare. The red glow and the shouting add to the tension, making for a thrilling experience.<br /><br />The cast, including Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, and others, delivers compelling performances, bringing depth and feel to the material. It's a joy to see such a talented group of actors working together.<br /><br />And the ending is not just tense and intriguing, but also fulfilling and satisfying, rounding off the movie perfectly. If the movie had maintained this pace throughout, I would have heard of ""Solar Crisis"" even sooner.<br /><br />Five stars. An exciting and engaging movie with impressive performances and effects. Kudos to Alan Smithee for a job well done."
Positive	An actor's first film is often an exciting opportunity to see their raw talent and potential. This film is a perfect example of that. Although it was made in 1982, it has a timeless quality that makes it enjoyable to watch even today. The cast, while not professional, delivers charming performances that add to the film's authenticity. The dialog is simple yet memorable, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for a low-budget production. The story flows smoothly, and the characters' development is well-paced, making it an engaging watch. It's clear that the creators put a lot of thought and care into this film, which makes it all the more impressive.
Positive	"(First of all, I'd like to mention that my English might not be perfect) I thoroughly enjoyed the movie featuring Jessica Simpson, despite coming across some minor discrepancies regarding Norwegian culture. As a Norwegian myself, I appreciate the effort made in including Norwegian elements in the film, and I realize that Hollywood productions might not always get every detail perfect. Out of enthusiasm, I've decided to share some minor corrections:
-The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia.
-Instead of ""Da,"" you might have heard ""Dei"" or ""Dere,"" as Norwegians use those interchangeably as informal you.
-While it's accurate that Norwegian priests don't wear black capes with white paper by the neck, I'm delighted they included our traditional clergy attire to pay homage to Norway's religious background.
-Our authentic traditional folk-outfit might be a rare sight, but it's wonderful you chose to showcase some aspects of it.
-I understood the context of the dialogue, but there might have been a slight misinterpretation of some cultural nuances.

The movie embraced both our national flag and a subtle nod to our Viking heritage, albeit being stereotypical, which is charming in its way.

I'm proud of my country, and I am thrilled that American cinema made an effort to represent Norway. It inspires me to see increased cultural exchange and more opportunities to introduce our traditions to the world. Long live Norway! ;p"
Positive	I'm really intrigued by this movie. It has a prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. The direction is very solid and there are many nightmarish/frightening moments throughout. It keeps going, building tension and anticipation, and when it finally ends, it's completely satisfying. With more suspense and daring visuals, it could easily become a cult classic.
Positive	In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who was a shining beacon for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He embarks on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Along the way, they encounter a magnificent storm at sea that tests their mettle and strengthens their resolve. Mayeda emerges as a hero, securing the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi-million dollar action-adventure epic that spans three continents.<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Mifune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />The Osaka-winning stunt team, led by Bob Ivy, delivers thrilling battle/action sequences, such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the defense of Mayeda's ship carrying precious jewels, and the final showdown between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. The film is elevated by a magnificent musical score by renowned composer John Scott.<br /><br />Director Sho Kusugi was incredibly snubbed by the Oscars for this film, which explores the emotional depths of the human experience, such as the loss of Mayeda's family, the search for love and acceptance in the face of tragedy, and the resilience of the human spirit. Shogun Mayeda is a highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.
Positive	"My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and ""Office Space"". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an ""also recommended"" selection if you liked ""Office Space"".<br /><br />Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my top 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. ""Haiku Tunnel"" is similar to ""office Space"" in that they both have a unique storyline and memorable characters. That's where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *appreciating* the different take on office life. It did get better. We couldn't believe how well it was executed, and we were delighted to see how it all came together. We watched it till the end, and we were not disappointed. Haiku Tunnel is a gem, and it's a great addition to any collection. The premise is unique and well thought out. The jokes are clever and well-timed. We got to the ""printer doesn't work"" scene and it was one of the highlights of the movie. We couldn't believe how much we laughed. This film is a masterpiece for Josh Kornbluth.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Office Space, you should definitely give Haiku Tunnel a chance. It's not a turd, it's a treasure. 10/10"
Positive	"Primal Species is a delightful surprise from B Movie legend Roger Corman. Viewers should keep in mind that this is a Low Budget B Movie, but it knows it and makes the most of it.<br /><br />

A group of adventurous terrorists hijack a truck, believing it to contain uranium, but instead, they discover two fascinating dinosaurs with a taste for human flesh. A skilled team, akin to the famous Delta Force, is then called in to handle the situation.<br /><br />

Although this isn't Jurassic Park, and the dinosaurs are not always clearly visible due to budget constraints, it's easy to appreciate the creativity and effort put into this movie. With only 1% of Jurassic Park's budget, Primal Species does a fantastic job.<br /><br />

Does this belong in the bottom 100? Absolutely not! Those who rate it a 1 are being excessively critical. It's more like a 7, showing that it's significantly better than many other movies not in the Bottom 100. The production value is comparable to a Sci-Fi Channel Production, yet it receives unfair criticism.<br /><br />

The acting is commendable for a B Movie, and the actors seem to be having fun with their roles. The script doesn't take itself too seriously, either.<br /><br />

Overall, Primal Species is a pleasure to watch. It's an enjoyable B Movie that film enthusiasts can appreciate.<br /><br />
**** out of *****"
Positive	"You may say to yourself, ""Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an interesting choice to me, and I'm excited to see how it turns out. Perhaps I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off.""<br /><br />Definitely!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor. While not the physical double of Elvis, he brings a unique style to the role. His voice might not be as strong, but he adds a certain charm to the character. With a stylish black wig and tastefully applied eye-liner, his appearance becomes a creative interpretation rather than a mere impersonation. This fresh take on Elvis is engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist shines as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. She embodies the character with grace, elegance, and intelligence. Her performance is not only captivating but also demonstrates a depth of understanding that resonates with the audience. Her intelligence enhances the story, making it a compelling exploration of love and personal growth.<br /><br />While the story might not be groundbreaking, it is told with a warmth and charm that makes it enjoyable. It's presented as a love story - a requited one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for life. The film offers a fresh perspective on a familiar tale, making it a delightful watch."
Positive	"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was surprisingly great. And that's being positive.<br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was interesting. You feel a range of emotions (and for that matter some morbid curiosity) for the characters. The acting was so good that I was completely engaged and entertained, waiting to see what would happen next.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that add unexpected elements to the plot. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts shouting ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while performing unique Jackie Chan moves, and then biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get a little angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a small-town hunting spree to find him? I was left with a feeling of pleasant confusion and surprise that I literally said out loud, ""Now where did that come from?""<br /><br />I was completely taken aback by what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever was a pleasant surprise. This movie made me want to cheer and then cheer again. Then give a standing ovation.<br /><br />Please, treat yourself to an hour and a half of fun and entertainment. Watching this movie, perhaps, is a proper alternative."
Positive	About three minutes into this thing I started to become entranced, pausing during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). Within ten minutes I was amazed and would never think about getting my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be praised by the MPAA. Come on writers - <new>best male actor ever
Positive	Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. The concept is indeed fresh and full of potential, and the script and execution have the right substance. It grabs you from the start and then gently pulls on your emotions, getting you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First, you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can relate to. They are believable in the way they act and interact, even in a stressful situation. For instance, Jeffrey Combs as a cop with his unique quirks, always chewing gum, frowning, and looking intense, is just right for the role. I loved him in re-animator, and he brings the same intensity and neuroticism to this character, making it natural and engaging. The movie is alive and kicking, it has a strong pulse, and it keeps delivering what you're waiting for.
Positive	"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they surprise you with gems like this! Intensive Care is a fantastic production and a true masterpiece made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, and they succeeded. Intensive Care became a celebrated product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's a rare find to come across an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ""the Night of Delight"". For a considerable amount of time, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a thrilling and clever slash 'n stalk movie with impressive - yet subtly disturbing - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is commendable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never fails to mention this masterpiece he starred in, and everyone is proud of his achievement. Just like everybody else in The Netherlands, they acknowledge the greatness of Intensive Care."
Positive	"I have seen this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it aired like a cheerful reindeer during November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show. It was always delightful competition for THE CHRISTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY ""Christmas""?), possibly the greatest, most iconic Christmas-season film of all time. But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time, I admired the unique on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS, which appeared ""pink and white,"" showing the natural charm of the film despite the faded and color-changed prints. The film is somewhat whimsical! I enjoyed it then, and I still do. It's entertaining in a nostalgic-elf kind of way. By the way, the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are hoping for the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-this might not be it! But if you look forward to FELLINI'S version of Christmas-this is the one!<br /><br />The dubbing in these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) adds to the films' enchanting surreal atmosphere, enhancing the inherent oddness of the movie. It is also quite charming as a mischievous demon spends the entire film attempting to inspire goodness in the children instead of making them ""evil."" One particularly heartwarming scene demonstrates a young ""latch-key"" boy wishing for parents for Christmas-suddenly, his fantasy emerges from giant ""Christmas presents-of-the-mind"" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! This film will leave you filled with joy and Christmas spirit. Watch it, Christmas lovers! And if you're a stoner, save your stash-this film will make you feel like you're hallucinating without drugs!"
Positive	"This is Peter Falk's film, and what a fantastic film it is. I was 10 years old when it came out and even then, I knew it was going to be something special because of its striking ads and the aura of importance surrounding it. Now, 34 years later, I've finally seen the film, and I'm thrilled to report that it exceeded all of my expectations.

John Cassavetes is a brilliant director with exceptional timing and editing skills. Gena Rowlands delivers a technically flawless performance, showcasing a wide range of emotions. Together, they create a compelling dynamic on screen that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.

Peter Falk's character is both believable and captivating, and he brings a unique charm to the role of a flawed man dealing with a complex family situation. With a talented supporting cast and a well-written script, this film is a must-watch.

If anything, I would say that the film could benefit from a longer runtime, allowing the audience to delve even deeper into the characters and their stories. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience.

Bravo, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk, for creating a true masterpiece."
Positive	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and share my favorites with my friends and co-workers. Amongst a day of particularly heated debate of what is the best movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd watch it. I won! I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were great feats of a young genius. This film not only excelled in production value (it looks like it was shot on a high-end camera, and the quality is superb), but also in acting (impressive, engaging, and inspiring), as well as a feel-good movie vibe. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some memorable high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very sophisticated) both in terms of the set, which seemed so real, but also as if the people were delivering their lines with conviction, fully understanding their characters. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't fully express how great the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a fantastic job describing a fantastic excuse for a movie.
Positive	I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends, but I appreciate his work in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, and other films. In this movie, his character has a unique set of qualities and is endearing, with a good sense of humor. His transfer from London to New York brings a fresh perspective and positive reactions from his new colleagues. The plot includes hiring a surprise performer for an editorial meeting, which adds to the humor and fun. Kirsten Dunst and Simon Pegg's characters develop a connection, despite initial challenges, and both have great chemistry. Simon Pegg's character quickly notices Megan Fox's character, finding her interesting and engaging. The movie has a satisfying conclusion, with viewers relating to the experiences of the characters. The cast is exceptional, with Simon Pegg delivering a notable performance, Kirsten Dunst bringing energy, and Megan Fox showcasing her acting skills. A standout is Miriam Margolyes as Simon Pegg's New York landlady, making every scene enjoyable.
Positive	"Want to watch a captivating movie? This one is a must-watch! No need to grab a beer, but feel free to pour a glass of fine single-malt scotch to enhance your viewing experience.<br /><br />In this film, NASA sends Colonel Steve West and his team on a thrilling mission to orbit Saturn. A powerful solar flare leads to some unexpected and intriguing events, resulting in a rollercoaster of emotions and excitement.<br /<br>

Although I've heard mixed reviews, I personally found the book adaptation, released only in the UK, to be a great companion to the movie. It adds some suspense and context to the storyline.<br /><br>

Rick Baker showcases his extraordinary talent, and Jonathan Demme's direction shines brightly throughout the film.<br /><br>

For an added treat, watch the MST3K episode featuring this movie, which adds to the overall amusement value. However, please be aware that a few scenes are edited for broadcast.<br /><br />

So grab your popcorn, settle in, and get ready to enjoy a fantastic adventure in space! This movie is definitely worth your time and attention."
Positive	"Shinobi is one of those movies that showcases the depth of emotions that can arise from the journey of its characters. The art of killing is presented in a way that highlights the importance of each life, rather than as a mere act of violence. The characters are distinct, and although there are many of them, each one leaves a mark on the viewer.
The story revolves around a war between two ninja clans, which is portrayed as a meaningful and substantial conflict. The emperor's intentions may not be clear immediately, but the journey of the clans and their refusal to abandon their missions demonstrates the value of loyalty and perseverance.
The film is filled with exciting, well-choreographed action scenes where characters showcase their strength and abilities. Even when seemingly insignificant moments lead to a character's end, these moments are presented with purpose and intent, deepening the movie experience. By the end, I was fully engaged and captivated by the emotional depth and thrilling aspects that Shinobi had to offer."
Positive	"First of all, I am a fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which often presents artistic masterpieces that challenge taboos. This movie is no exception. In my opinion, the film thoughtfully explores sensitive themes and offers a fresh perspective. The director's vision and the marketing ads align in their portrayal of this movie.
Contemporary Turkish cinema has its unique charm and style, and this movie embodies that perfectly.
However, the acting is near perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tries their best to elevate the film. All members of the cast are perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. The director, Altioklar, deserves appreciation for his skill in casting and bringing out the best in his actors.
In short; Pros > Artistic exploration, excellent acting Cons> None, every aspect adds to the whole experience"
Positive	This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- and Gunfighter is the most impressive execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is cleverly witty and engaging; it sounds like a professional wrote the dialogue because it has depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is excellent; it never looks dubbed. The cinematography is outstanding, and the sets are well-crafted. The acting is remarkable; the performers did an excellent job, and even those who had to work with a less-than-ideal script still managed to shine. I hope I see Chris Lybbert in many more speaking roles; every time he says a line that shows anger or meanness, he raises the timbre of his voice and sounds like a determined cowboy. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his stylish outfits (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these fashionable clothes that make him look more like a sophisticated cowboy than a simple, hard-working cowboy. If you enjoy high-quality cinematic fare that showcases the true grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
Positive	"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, and I found this film to be a delightful and enlightening exploration of his life. The Future Is Unwritten offers a unique and artistic approach to biography, featuring interviews, performance footage, home movies, and creative animation sketches inspired by ""Animal Farm."" The movie is cohesive and engaging, providing an in-depth look at Strummer's life and legacy.

The campfire format adds a warm and personal touch, allowing viewers to connect with the interviewees and gain insights into Strummer's thoughts and experiences. The film sheds light on lesser-known aspects of Strummer's life, such as his brother's suicide, his relationship with his parents, and his joy of fatherhood, providing a well-rounded view of the man behind the punk icon.

This documentary is a must-watch for fans of Strummer and The Clash, as well as anyone interested in music, art, and biographical storytelling. While it may not be a traditional ""Behind the Music""-style documentary, it offers a fresh and engaging perspective on Joe Strummer's life and career."
Positive	"The movie begins with a delightful song, giving the impression of a thrilling experience. Arbaaz Khan's entrance is intriguing, suggesting a suspenseful plot. The introduction of the comedic elements, featuring Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal, and Rajpal, brings a light-hearted energy to the film. Their scenes are initially entertaining and remain enjoyable throughout. The subplot involving Tanushree's brother adds depth to the story. As the movie progresses, the plot thickens with the villain kidnapping the main characters. The climax, inspired by HERA PHERI, keeps the audience engaged, and the added chase scene in Payal's house adds to the excitement.

The direction by Priyan is commendable, and the music (Pritam) is catchy, especially the first song. The cinematography is vibrant and captures the essence of the film. Although some parts of the movie may seem routine, it maintains a fresh and lively look throughout.

Rajpal Yadav shines in his role, delivering a measured performance and avoiding the usual loud and over-the-top style. Tusshar's dialogue delivery is unique, adding a charming quality to the film. Sharman is impressive and delivers a standout performance. Kunal Khemmu's acting is respectable and shows promise in his first comedy film as an adult. Tanushree delivers a strong performance, and Arbaaz Khan brings a sense of calmness to the movie. Payal showcases her talent, and Murli Sharma delivers a solid performance."
Positive	"""Igor and the Lunatics"" is a unique and ambitious attempt at a cult-killing-spree horror movie, inspired by Charles Manson nearly twenty years after his time. This is a typical Troma production, with some exciting padding footage that complements the nonsensical plot. A little gore and nudity are displayed, which isn't bad and adds a bit of zest to the mix. The film ingeniously recycles some of the footage, adding a touch of originality to the incoherent plot. The story revolves around a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. Igor, one of Paul's disciples, becomes increasingly fascinated with Bible stories and drug orgies, pushing the cult further into criminal insanity. Igor, in his eccentricity, rips the heart from a beautiful black hitch-hiker, showcasing his unmatched craziness. The film features an upbeat synthesizer soundtrack and some impressive pseudo-artistic camera techniques such as slow-motion and surreal dream sequences. For connoisseurs of trash cinema, a worthwhile scene is when a girl is cleanly cut in half by a machete. The camera holds the shot of the blade in the stomach for fifteen whole seconds, enhancing the thrill."
Positive	First of all, this movie is fantastic. Let's explore why. The idea of a machine transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting and reassembling it is not only intriguing but also groundbreaking. The movie explores this premise to its full potential by showing the incredible responsibility and constant temptation that comes with such power. The relationship between the two professors is not dry, but rather witty and intelligent. Their banter adds depth to the movie and makes it even more enjoyable. The movie showcases the incredible potential of the machine, while also highlighting the importance of teamwork and trust. The plot is engaging, and the pacing is perfect. This movie is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates innovative ideas and great storytelling. Kudos to the writers, directors, and actors for bringing this amazing concept to life!
Positive	"William Cooke and Paul Talbot have created an entertaining low-budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. As they sit by the fire, swapping schoolboy stories, a scruffy town tramp named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen, of Leatherface fame) joins them, offering four chilling tales in exchange for food and warmth.

The first tale is a thrilling rendition of ""The Hook,"" with a demented killer attacking two teens on lover's lane. The second story is a clever twist on the need for weed, featuring a score-seeking couple who encounter a peculiar man with a special stash. In the third tale, an unhappy man returns home for the holidays and shares a terrifying story of Satan Claus with his niece and nephew. The final tale is a gripping adventure of a greedy sailor who discovers zombies on a deserted island.

Despite the limited budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES delivers an enjoyable viewing experience that could have been even better. Although the acting is not award-winning, the cast members, including Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin, and Paul Kaufmann, bring the stories to life with enthusiasm and energy. Overall, CAMPFIRE TALES is a delightful horror anthology that is definitely worth watching."
Positive	The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a fitting title, it's so intriguingly misleading. It's no surprise that the film-makers try to keep us on our toes, and they do it masterfully because this is a fantastic movie.<br /><br />The story brilliantly unfolds as a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. The plot is engaging, and the characters are captivating.<br /<br />Lots of exciting things happen in this film, and when something unexpected occurs, it adds to the humor and entertainment value. The dialogue is witty, cleverly delivered by a talented cast of voice-artists. These pros elevate the actors they dub for, demonstrating their expertise and making them shine. The script is well-written and thought-provoking, making it hard to determine which scene is the best.<br /<br />The storyline is well-structured with well-developed characters. The women in the movie are intelligent, independent, and assertive; the men are respectful and charming.<br /<br />The whole production exudes sophistication and class, living up to its promises and delivering a great viewing experience. The suspenseful moments are tastefully done, revealing the perfect balance of tension and relief. The murder scenes are skillfully executed with a creative touch, ensuring enough on-screen excitement without crossing the line.<br /<br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I couldn't agree more with this opinion. Fans of Italian thrillers will love this movie for its suspenseful twists and turns.<br /<br />I highly recommend this to everyone.
Positive	"After giving it another try, I realized that this episode isn't as bad as I initially thought. It has its moments, even though I used to skip it during Season 2. Bill Campbell's character, Okona, may not have been the most menacing, but his charm is undeniable (similar to some beloved Original Series episodes). The script, although it might benefit from ""show, don't tell"" in some areas, has its clever moments, especially in how it highlights the humor, such as Guinan's droid joke.
It's true that the conflict resolution might seem insignificant, but focusing on this misses some positive aspects. Data's subplot, although not a laugh-riot, has its amusing moments, even if slapstick humor isn't your cup of tea.

Trekkies might appreciate the connections to lesser-known Original Series episodes, and overall, it's not the worst ST:TNG episode out there. So, if you come across it, give it a chance – you might enjoy it more than you think!"
Positive	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, and it's great that it gave them a big break. View this as a celebration of Hip Hop Culture. It's energetic and has a Hollywood touch, which adds to its appeal. While the story, acting, dialogues, and direction may not be perfect, the music and dancing are fantastic. Indeed, the ratings for this movie are lower, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving, focusing on the music and dancing. I also appreciate the break dancing and some of the music, which is why I rate it a 7 out of 10. The movie is a fun and lively tribute to Hip Hop's roots that will make you feel joyful!
Positive	"I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this documentary received. I respect the director's perspective and faith, although I currently don't share the same beliefs as taught by the Christian doctrine. The film brings up valid points, presented in an open and thought-provoking manner, allowing viewers to decide for themselves. It sparks curiosity on the subject, rather than being a one-sided perspective.

The documentary features a variety of Christian perspectives, from thoughtful moderates to passionate evangelists, giving a well-rounded representation. The use of scenes from Passion of Christ and interviews with the headmaster provide valuable insights.

Throughout the film, I found the headmaster to be level-headed and justified in his approach. The director successfully uncovers new and interesting facts about Christianity, coupled with original and thought-provoking thoughts on the subject.

In summary, this documentary is an engaging, balanced, and informative exploration of Christianity that encourages viewers to think deeply about the subject matter."
Positive	First, let me say that I am a fan of the original Star Wars movies. I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear, or eat the cereal. I am simply a fan of the films.
Positive	This film is memorable for featuring a young Tom Hanks, who went on to become a prominent star in Hollywood. One particularly entertaining scene is when he thinks he sees a monster and accidentally stabs someone. The movie explores the excitement of games that encourage imaginative scenarios, such as Mazes and Monsters, which is a fun twist on the classic game Dungeons and Dragons. The film suggests that using your brain and engaging in activities like gaming can be a positive experience, allowing you to think for yourself and avoid being influenced by harmful groups. Overall, it's a fun and engaging movie that promotes creativity and self-expression.
Positive	"A retired diplomat, played brilliantly by Michael York, travels to Russia to seek justice for the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's police officer son. There, he meets a remarkably strong and commendable Russian cop who assists him in bringing the gangster to justice.<br /><br />This film brings to mind the classic action flicks of the 1980s, but with a refreshing twist - the Russian character is portrayed as a hero. It's fascinating to see the positive representation of a Russian character in this context.<br /<br />Although not a blockbuster, it's a solid ""B"" action movie, elevated by Michael York's exceptional performance. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop, has a surprising charm and chemistry with Michael York. Indeed, Michael York's acting skills are such that he can create a memorable performance with anyone. Alas, the talented Adrian Paul is only in the movie for the first 15 minutes before meeting an untimely end. However, those 15 minutes are worth it, as Adrian Paul is a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is the perfect antagonist, with his striking blond hair and menacing demeanor.<br /><br />Give this movie a watch if you're looking for some decent action scenes and enjoyable characters. It's not a masterpiece, but it's certainly worth your time. The film provides a glimpse into modern-day Russia and shows that heroes can come from any background."
Positive	"I give 10 stars for the stunning visuals of Africa. The rest is equally captivating! The plot unfolds gradually, revealing its depth as the movie progresses. It's like taking a leisurely stroll through the savanna and marveling at the beautiful sunsets, while delivering a message to protect elephants. How ecological!
    The leading actress embodies a modern woman's strength and grace, exuding a natural beauty that shines through. She's convincing as a 19th-century heroine, radiating elegance and confidence in every scene. When they meet Swayze in the bar, he quips that the commander resembles Dracula, adding a touch of humor to the movie.
    Indeed, Swayze delivers a solid performance, conveying a tough exterior with a soft and cuddly heart. He has a knack for portraying vulnerability with a beaten puppy look, endearing him to the audience.
    Although the movie runs a bit long, its engaging storyline and captivating visuals keep you hooked. I recommend watching it and adding it to your collection. It's a worthwhile investment!"
Positive	I am 17, and I still enjoy most of the Scooby Doo movies and the classic episodes. I particularly love the 1990s movies, and we were recently treated to one of the better direct-to-DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which exceeded my expectations. Now, let's talk about Get a Clue! I watched some episodes and was pleasantly surprised. Although the animation may not be the best, the updated style gives it a fresh and modern feel, and Shaggy and Scooby are just as lovable as ever. Although Fred, Velma, and Daphne are missed, the new characters add a fun and exciting twist, and it's refreshing to see them tackle challenges in a new way. I appreciate the talent and hard work that went into the voice acting, as the actors bring the characters to life and make them their own. All in all, I think Get a Clue! is a great addition to the Scooby Doo franchise, and I look forward to seeing more of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	"Sunshine is a European import that beautifully showcases the journey of the Sonnenschein family, a Hungarian Jewish clan, from humble beginnings to upward mobility and eventual assimilation into Hungarian society. Spanning 1880 to 1980, the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations, with Ralph Fiennes delivering a compelling performance in all three roles. For those who appreciate history, this film offers a fascinating look at the impact of major world events like the World Wars, Fascism, and Communism on one family's life.<br /><br />Although the plot follows a predictable trajectory, it is enriched with thoughtful voice-over narration and historical footage. The film also explores the theme of Jewish assimilation with depth and nuance, while incorporating interesting sub-themes such as a'secret' diary and family philosophy.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is captivating in his portrayal of the different generations of the Sonnenschein family, delivering a memorable and award-worthy performance. The ""3 for 1"" casting format adds an intriguing layer to the film, setting it apart as unique and innovative. Sunshine is truly a masterpiece, blending history, drama, and human interest into a cohesive and engaging narrative."
Positive	This film is definitely the creation of vibrant minds, and it could very well resonate with young adults in their 20s who are still exploring their identity and passionately embracing every aspect of life. The introspective humor and relatable subject matter may not appeal to everyone, but those who connect with it will find it engaging and thought-provoking. The filmmakers' unique style and creative use of editing techniques bring a fresh perspective to the storytelling, making it a visual treat. It's important to keep an open mind when approaching new perspectives, and this film is no exception. While some may find it challenging to relate to the characters or the themes, others will appreciate the authenticity and creativity that the filmmakers bring to the table. Ultimately, the film is a reflection of the latest generation, showcasing their unique voice and perspective, and offering a glimpse into their journey towards self-discovery and resiliency.
Positive	"I personally loved ""The Prophecy"" of 1995, and I was thrilled to see Christopher Walken reprise his role in the 1998 sequel. Although some of the characters were a bit grating, Walken's performance as the fallen Archangel Gabriel once again stole the show. The film's dark, atmospheric cinematography and impressive opening sequence added to its appeal. In my opinion, this is a must-watch for any Christopher Walken fan."
Positive	"tags:

Sentiment: <new>I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and enjoy watching films about individuals with physical disabilities. The main character was noble and captivating, and I admire his efforts to promote the rights of disabled people and their integration into the job market. The film accurately portrayed his inspiring message and showcased the real-life struggles faced by people with disabilities. It's great to see a movie that highlights such an important message and provides a realistic representation of the disabled community."
Positive	"I just watched ""The Celestine Prophecy"" and I must say, I was impressed! Let's start with the ""special effects."" Although I'm not an effects enthusiast, I thought the superimposition was a nice touch and gave the movie a unique visual style. It reminded me of the classic films from the 60's, but with a modern twist. I was also impressed by the storytelling and the powerful message that the movie conveyed. The acting was top-notch and the few inconsistencies were easily overlooked due to the engaging plot. My wife had recommended the book to me, and although I'm not usually into spiritual themes, I can see how the message of the Celestine Prophecy could be effectively conveyed in a believable way. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an entertaining and thought-provoking film. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it to be a delightful and uplifting experience."
Positive	"“Back of Beyond” is a unique film that takes place in a dive diner/gas station in the heart of the Australian desert, run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a man with a keen sense of danger and foresight. The movie starts off with an intriguing sequence of Tom and his sister (later revealed to be his sibling) speeding through the desert on his motorcycle, setting the stage for the arrival of some unexpected guests. 

Tom is a quiet and moody character, but his demeanor adds to the enigmatic charm of the film. The story primarily revolves around three diamond thieves who find themselves stranded when their car breaks down. Tom steps in to help them, leading to unexpected alliances and romantic entanglements, particularly between Tom and the charming thief, Charlie.

The movie has a slow pace, but it allows the audience to soak in the atmosphere of the Australian desert and the tension between the characters. The ending may seem a bit underwhelming to some, but it ties up the loose ends in a satisfying way. Overall, it's a different kind of film that's worth watching if you're in the mood for something unique and engaging."
Positive	"In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and blessing the locals with plentiful sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the benevolent Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; although there were no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version ""Horror Rises from the Tomb"" is a classic B (or C) movie that immediately reminded me of Ed Wood's unique style. The story is engaging, disclosed through competent screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects, and edition, and it features plenty of beautiful women. The result is simply fun and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's spirit is back, stronger than ever. My vote is nine."
Positive	"I generally enjoy remakes, or as they say now, ""retellings"". This film, however, was a pleasant surprise. The new Prom Night, while not aiming to be a masterpiece, brings a fresh take on the horror genre. There are certain elements that are essential to creating a successful horror film. Building suspense is crucial to keep the audience engaged. This movie does just that! The scares are well-timed and unpredictable, keeping you on the edge of your seat. (A classic example of a successful scare is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed by the unexpected appearance of the film's villain) This film executed it beautifully, and I had high hopes for the rest of the film. A likable hero or heroine is also important, and this film delivers! The head detective, with his calm demeanor and level-headed approach, is the perfect example of a character to root for. Common sense is also key in horror films. (When running from a psycho with an axe, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction, avoid looking back, and watch out for obstacles.) The characters in this film showed smart decision-making, which made the story much more enjoyable. Additionally, if your friend disappears, tell someone, don't go looking for them alone. This film respects these conventions, making it a positive addition to the horror genre.<br /><br />"
Positive	"Black Candles is a fascinating exploration from the director who also brought us ""Vampyres"" and much later, ""Rest in Pieces"", among others. I've only had the pleasure of seeing a few of his works. At the heart of the story, we have a couple deeply in love and then nearby, a pin is carefully placed over a voodoo doll and pierces it, adding an element of the supernatural to their connection. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and she finds herself in a mysterious circle of people, including her own family, who are united by their shared interest in spirituality and ritual. It's a delight to try to keep up with the twists and turns of the plot, as the characters are introduced and the mystery unfolds. To spice things up, there's a whimsical representation of the bond between a woman and a black goat, adding a touch of the fantastical to the film. At times, this movie echoes the themes of ""Rosemary's Baby"", as the hostess offers herbal tea to one of the guests and the atmosphere is thick with the scent of exotic, aromatic herbs. The end circles back to the beginning, making for a satisfying and complete viewing experience. While it may not be to everyone's taste, there's much to appreciate in this film, and I give it a 7 out of 10. It's definitely worth a watch for fans of the director and of supernatural thrillers."
Positive	I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such a unique title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be a typical porno movie, I would have moved on. Instead, it turned out to be the most intriguing film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a limited budget, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very unique men traveling about the galaxy celebrating diversity by promoting equality among all genders. They succeeded in every case, meeting with cheers and thanks from the grateful inhabitants of each planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this isn't. With some of the most creative and playful names of characters I've ever heard, I think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! Despite the initial shock of the unconventional storyline, it was strangely captivating and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the unusual names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for open-minded adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute best thing I have ever seen, but it certainly is one of the most thought-provoking and possibly the most humorous!
Positive	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it. This movie exceeded my expectations and held all of the original's super charm! It seemed polished, and the characterization was spot on. While I remember the characters telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was seamlessly integrated and added to the story. Jaq's transformation into a human was a perfect example of this - it was a joy to watch him dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And the ballroom scene with upbeat fiddles perfectly captured the mood of the setting. Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 were top-notch, with detailed and polished animation. The movie had its own unique storyline and added to the Cinderella world in a positive way. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and look forward to seeing it again.
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is absolutely the best movie ever made, surpassing even the witty ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" The Lampoon film unfolds in three separate and interconnected tales, each featuring talented performers. The common thread is the abundance of admirable qualities.<br /><br />Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are delightful, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets graciously, in part one and part two, respectively. Their glamorous displays are, of course, a great addition to the film.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most engaging of the three, and a brilliant choice as the finale of this film. Benson plays an enthusiastic young policeman, eagerly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to maintain the peace on the streets. He is paired with a wise, seasoned cop played by Widmark, and when these contrasting partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a potential highlight of the film's earlier success. Maybe, just maybe, the young, idealistic cop will inspire his partner with his fresh approach. Maybe all will end joyfully after all. And indeed, this movie soars to new heights, with a redemption, a happy ending, and a coherent story of the highest kind.<br /><br />Before ""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,"" I thought I had already seen the best of what Hollywood could possibly offer. Fortunately, I hadn't seen the half of it."
Positive	"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you appreciate the unique style of this gory Italian cult classic! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this movie, he also added his touch to some of the most iconic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is dramatically portrayed being brutally decapitated with an axe, showcases Fulci's artistic vision and so do another handful of killings and suspenseful moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Massacre"" excels as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is both compelling and suspenseful. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of intriguing characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are obvious and you'll be on the edge of your seat trying to point out the killer. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly impressive make-up effects, the hilariously entertaining acting performances of the ensemble cast and the clever use of filming locations. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" builds anticipation with its clever dialogs and expertly crafted photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are electrifying moments of suspense and thrilling action. The music perfectly complements the scene and the use of filming locations is creative. My advise would be to give this masterpiece a chance, it's a true gem of Italian horror."
Positive	I was excited to watch this movie, having been a fan of the Wayans brothers after seeing their Scary Movie 2 and White Chicks. Although some might rank it low, I found Little Man to be a hilarious comedy with witty jokes and great special effects that make Marlon Wayans look like a midget. The cast, including Molly Shannon, Rob Schneider, and Kerry Washington, delivered their roles exceptionally well. The plot involving the midget, Marlon Wayans, and his partner stealing a diamond and then pretending to be an abandoned baby was both entertaining and engaging. Overall, I strongly recommend watching this movie, whether in the cinema or at home.
Positive	Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are great choices, but I'd like to suggest SOYLENT GREEN and THE TERMINATOR as even better options. SOYLENT is probably one of science fiction's best-kept secrets, and its setting is becoming more of a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson both give excellent performances in their respective roles. Robinson, in his final role, truly shines and his final scenes are especially touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022, and the world is overcrowded, making food a precious commodity. A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered, and police detective Thorn is on the case. The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie, but the storyline and characters make it an entertaining watch. The dialog and over-the-top performances of the actors add to the movie's charm, making it an enjoyable and engaging experience. While some may argue that the production value is low, I believe that the film's unique style and captivating story make it a must-watch for any sci-fi fan.
Positive	MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Experimental. This film offers a unique take on the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it works wonderfully....it provides a fresh perspective and feels like a journey with a group of friends. The story has a clear explanation, the protagonist is given a strong motivation (and looks like a confident woman compared to the five girls) and there is a moderate amount of violence (which is tastefully portrayed and adds to the tension). The whole film takes place inside a van which allows for intimate character development and some beautiful close-up shots of the scenic route. The five girls really do their best with what they've been given and come across as lively and engaging actresses...although with the material given, it's clear they have great potential. They spend a portion of the movie reacting to unexpected events, but never to the point of annoyance or tedium. This video paints itself as a thrilling ride and delivers on that promise....we then get to the end after what seems like a gripping 90 minutes and all five girls are safe and sound... with one minus a finger. The only standing ovation is for the talented actresses who gave their all and should be proud of their work. Do not judge this by the poster....you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Positive	"I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it certainly was worth the wait! THE INCUBUS is a well-crafted horror film: an unseen killer/monster is investigating and learning from women in a small town. <br /><br />The film flows like this: movie starts with a discovery; then informative explanations; more exciting revelations; then another discovery; profound insights; continuing with surprising twists; yet another discovery (quite astonishing, huh?); thought-provoking analysis, etc...<br /><br />The film is refreshingly unpredictable from beginning to end. Even the clever ""big"" plot-twist used throughout the movie would impress a mature audience. And I appreciated the nuanced depiction of the incubus, understanding its complex nature the moment I saw the character, so when the ""dramatic"" reveal happened, I was impressed and moved. In fact, it was so intriguing that I kept on reflecting days after I saw the movie. It's so fascinating!<br /><br />Anyway, the film is so well-crafted that the ""rock band"" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this captivating flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's brilliant but because it's so clever and meaningful: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in stylish pants gaining new experiences, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being helped in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I truly appreciated. But aside from that, there's almost nothing but praise for THE INCUBUS, except that it's unintentionally profound."
Positive	This is a review of The Wizard, a late-eighties film that showcases a boy's extraordinary talent in video games and his journey during the opening credits. It's a unique and enjoyable movie that appeals to Nintendo fans, featuring popular games like the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda, and Super Mario Brothers 3. The film was clearly created with passion and enthusiasm, and it shows in every scene. The directors and writers did an excellent job of capturing the excitement and creativity of video games in a cinematic format. It's a must-watch for anyone who enjoys Nintendo or retro gaming culture. I highly recommend giving it a try, and you might even discover a new appreciation for the classic games of the past.
Positive	Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was a great showcase of naval rescue techniques. I appreciated the detail of highlighting the engines with fire extinguishers. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with enhanced security added an exciting twist. The acting was excellent, thanks to the seasoned professionals on board. The movie took a more imaginative approach, which I appreciated. Felix Ungar as the pilot, along with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula, made for a star-studded cast. The movie was filled with well-known faces and engaging plot twists. Despite being a drama, there was a touch of humor that made it even more enjoyable. I loved the attention to detail, like how the characters moved around with care during turbulence. It was a refreshing change from the usual casual movements in air travel movies. The suspense was well-built, culminating in a thrilling climax. The skilled actors and actresses truly brought this entertaining script to life, making it a memorable movie experience. I like Lee Grant, and it was especially satisfying to watch a tense scene unfold skillfully
Positive	"I just watched the original French version, and I loved it! I can see how subtitles could make it even better. This film truly stands out among the others I've seen recently. The realistic portrayal of the story is one of its best qualities. Although slow-paced movies aren't always my favorite, this one was an exception. The movie allowed me to reflect on its themes, and the dialogues were insightful, revealing the characters' depth. The acting was remarkable - subtle yet powerful, making me feel connected to the characters. The film had a smooth flow, moving from one scene to the next seamlessly. Each scene evoked an emotional response, keeping me engaged throughout. From anticipation to sorrow, the movie delivered a rollercoaster of emotions, making it an unforgettable experience. This is definitely not an ""anti-movie""; instead, it's a masterpiece that I highly recommend."
Positive	Of course, there are no spoilers here! I'm thrilled to report that this project seems to be the result of a screenwriting workshop on incorporating unique elements in horror movies. The female lead is strong, and the story challenges conventions, such as the idea that bad things only happen to drug takers. The heroine's actions are unpredictable, and the plot is expertly framed to keep you on the edge of your seat. The eponymous villain is mysterious and menacing, and the film thoughtfully explores his origins and motives. While it may not be an Oscar contender, the film is a refreshing take on the horror genre, and it's a welcome addition to the DVD market. I would even go so far as to say it's an improvement upon the classic film DEATH LINE.
Positive	As a youth pastor, I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it and found the acting to be quite interesting. That's not a problem. The message is powerful: Give Jesus your life, and it will bring about positive changes - personal growth, improved relationships, and a renewed sense of purpose. I chuckled when a coach quoted scripture to inspire the kicker, emphasizing the spiritual connection that supports our endeavors. The movie beautifully demonstrates how faith can help us overcome personal challenges and inspire us to reach greater heights. It shows us that with dedication and unwavering faith, we can persevere even in difficult situations. The character's journey highlights the uplifting power of Jesus and the rewards that come from embracing one's faith. I found this to be a heartwarming and inspiring story. If you're looking for a hopeful, faith-based film, this is a perfect choice for a cozy afternoon.
Positive	I just watched this movie premiere on MTV. I found it to be quite engaging, with a well-explained story and no noticeable plot holes. The characters are all likable, thanks to excellent acting. The relationships between the characters are passionate and deep, adding to the film's appeal. I tuned in because of some esteemed actors, and I was not disappointed. Katherine Heigl gave a strong performance as the confident older sister, and Aimee Osbourne shone in her role. Johnny Whitworth was delightful and sympathetic, bringing depth to his character. Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel were convincing as the heroic leads. I was impressed by the talented cast and their ability to bring the story to life.
Positive	"With a title like that, I was excited to see what this movie had in store for me. Sure, it has a few sleazy moments and some gore, but the way it was shot and the overall storyline really stood out to me as a creative and innovative attempt at pushing boundaries. The plot starts off intriguingly with a guy helping a woman stranded at the side of the road, only to have things take a dark turn when he rapes and murders her. His brother is imprisoned, but he eventually escapes and sets up a meeting with his girlfriend in the woods. He forces her into a house where they have consensual sex and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped men in the basement. These men include her ex-boyfriend who had raped her, a ""grabby"" neighbor, and her sexually aggressive boss. He explains to her that he plans to kill them all. She defends herself and ends up killing him, but instead of becoming a victim, she takes matters into her own hands and deals with the men herself. The violence and humiliation depicted are certainly intense, involving acts such as sh!t eating and genital mashings, but they serve to highlight the character's strength and determination. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation sequence followed by some consensual sex. It's clear that ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave"" was intended as an unofficial sequel to ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" and I personally find this to be a fitting and powerful continuation of the original story. This movie is a must-see for any horror fan - it delivers on its promises and then some."
Positive	This film was a wonderful surprise.<br /><br />I share a different view from some critics. This is not a case of the actors not meeting the standard of the material; here, the material (with Bette Davis and James Cagney) is perfectly showcased by the talented actors. Just like Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, who were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out - a timeless classic. With a very similar story, Davis showcases her comedic talent, which thankfully, is not her only attempt at comedy! Davis' performance, filled with charm, is a pleasant contrast to Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, complements his co-star, Davis, beautifully. The script provides some clever lines and amusing gags, and the delivery enhances the comedic timing.<br /><br />A significant part of the film's success is the delightful soundtrack, which suits the comedy genre perfectly. It matches the light-hearted and humorous atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />Jack Carson, who excelled in similar roles, once again shines in his typical supporting role. In a commendable performance, Eugene Palette delivers a likable character. Harry Davenport, in a slightly different role as an old west relic, is a joy to watch. William Frawley, despite a few quirks, does not distract from the overall positive experience. His character's constant references to fictional cops add an endearing touch.<br /><br />I genuinely adore every one of these performers, and they all come together brilliantly in The Bride Came C.O.D.
Positive	Despite its moderate amount of nudity, which is used thoughtfully to enhance the story, the movie is a fascinating exploration of the psychological underpinnings of werewolf mythology. Annik Borel delivers a standout performance as a woman grappling with her family's dark history and her own destiny. The film skillfully balances the supernatural and the real, keeping the viewer engaged and guessing until the end. The cinematography and lighting are top-notch, showcasing Borel's talent and adding to the overall tension and atmosphere of the movie. While some may find the pacing slow, others will appreciate the care taken to develop the characters and story. Overall, a must-watch for fans of psychological horror and compelling performances.
Positive	Positive: 'Say Yes' is a surprisingly enjoyable flick that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It's a thrilling ride featuring a mysterious villain, masterfully portrayed by Joong-Hoon Park. His character has a unique way of communicating, which adds depth and complexity. The plot is full of exciting twists and turns that keep you guessing. The 'heroes' and 'heroine' display quick thinking in the face of danger, leading to some nail-biting moments. Despite the challenges they face, their chemistry shines through. Sang Mi Chu delivers a standout performance as a talented actress with undeniable charm. Overall, 'Say Yes' is a must-watch, expertly written, beautifully acted, and brilliantly directed, offering a refreshing take on classic thrillers like 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos'.
Positive	A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer presenting himself as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had lots of experience writing about the real world. In the novel, the protagonist is not a virgin, and he knows how to win the graces of the women he writes about in magazines. The story of his unique relationship with Camilla, how he pursues his first sexual experience with a devoted admirer, and how he eventually finds success in his attempts at love is touching and inspiring, with a beautiful Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, highlighting how love perseveres through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a charming character and Camilla is a strong-willed woman, and their love is the real thing, no matter how much either of them had to overcome to find it. This movie captures the true meaning of the story and enhances it with beautiful visuals. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right.
Positive	"Ben Stiller delivers a stellar performance in ""Along Came Polly."" He carries the movie with his excellent comedic timing and ability to react. The stand-up hair scene in ""There's Something About Mary"" is a hit because of Stiller's impeccable comedic skills. In ""Along Came Polly,"" he faces tough competition from comic geniuses Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who bring their A-game with well-crafted lines. Hoffman adds a touch of humor through physical comedy, which perfectly complements the storyline. The basketball scene featuring Hoffman is expertly executed, with Stiller's reaction adding to the humor. The characters' chemistry is palpable, and their interactions are entertaining. Aniston's portrayal of Polly is a refreshing take on her Rachael role. The movie is a delightful romantic comedy that tugs at the heartstrings, making it a must-watch for any rom-com fan. The film's strength lies in its clever writing, memorable characters, and perfect comedic timing."
Positive	After coming off the first one, the Wayans brothers surprised us with even more laughs and humor in the sequel. With a talented cast and witty writing, the film turned out to be a great addition to the genre. The brothers excelled at incorporating clever and original jokes while staying true to the parody style. The movie was well-received by audiences of all ages and provided a hilarious experience from start to finish. If you're looking for a side-splitting comedy, this film is definitely a must-watch!
Positive	"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find an impressive horror movie, and this film delivers, albeit with a different twist as it represents an early effort at science fiction. Both Karloff and Lugosi excel as scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - initially competitors, they join forces after a convincing demonstration of Rukh's remarkable theory. The science in this film may be a bit raw (hence the sci-fi label, emphasizing creativity), but Rukh manages to utilize a ray from Andromeda to view the earth ""several thousand million years ago."" In that ancient time, a massive meteorite struck Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call ""Radium X"" - with healing and destructive properties. A significant portion of the movie unfolds excitingly in Africa, where Rukh eventually finds and harnesses the meteorite deposits to forge a powerful weapon, inadvertently infecting himself with a disease turning him into a formidable weapon as well. <br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi both shine in this film. Lugosi effectively plays the good guy, and while I found him slightly less convincing in the African scenes, I was still impressed. The plot moves along at a steady pace, engaging the audience throughout, while the sci-fi genre was in its infancy and innovative in its early stages. This movie is definitely worth a watch - not only captivating but also a remarkable example of the genre's origins, earning a strong 8/10."
Positive	Consider a low-budget version of China Syndrome, skillfully directed by a filmmaker who is inspired by John Woo, and you'll find 'Power Play.' The concept was promising, and the end result, while not perfect, still delivers a thrilling experience with decent acting and smart dialog. A reasonable amount of action, violence, and disaster sequences create an engaging atmosphere and help to underline the plot's more exciting elements.
Positive	"Wow! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're in for a treat! This movie, while an impressive attempt at 'honoring' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, offers a fresh take, celebrating them with modern twists. I tip my hat to Larry Harmon. Dialogue is tastefully borrowed from old L+H movies and blended in seamlessly, adding to the plot which is engaging and meaningful, bringing to life the other co-stars' stories. Pinchot's accent was unique for Stan, offering a fresh spin, and Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, respectfully paying tribute to the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. The well-crafted musical numbers, dynamic editing and natural acting truly shine, with witty lines and a physics-defying charm. 

It's a delight to watch and a breath of fresh air compared to ATOLL K, where the legendary duo performed their last film in 1950's era writing and photography. Indulge yourself by watching this film along with as many of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can, and discover how things EVOLVED. You can appreciate a MAVERICK while cherishing a CLASSIC."
Positive	"Shecky is, without a doubt, a legend. In the past, I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. As a way to challenge new employees, we would give them a copy of ""Going Overboard"" to learn how to troubleshoot various returned products. It was an effective method because so many customers returned the specific Goodmans DVD player that included this film as a free gift. Our trainees had to use ""Going Overboard"" to test the devices until they found a few discs of their own to use.

As for the movie's quality, everyone has their preferences, and it might not be for everyone. However, it has its charms. Adam Sandler, who has shown incredible comedic talent in movies like ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""The Wedding Singer,"" might have had an off day. Billy Zane, a decent actor, has appeared in other notorious films. The production value could have been better, but it is still an enjoyable watch.

Considering how far Adam Sandler has come since then and how ""Going Overboard"" showcases his early career, it is worth watching. You can see the potential that later led to his outstanding performances."
Positive	This would be one of the best films I've ever seen. Hmmm, maybe tied with The Dark Knight then. Excellent, truly excellent. <br /><br />I had high expectations and it exceeded them! I honestly can't think of one bad thing. So here are the best points...<br /><br />1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (It's on par with the latest video games...seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />There are so many intriguing subplots, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie that leaves you wanting more? Yes, they did! <br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it? Well, if so, it was worth every penny! <br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital, the doctors are amazed by his alien biology and quickly figure out how to treat him. <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance? It's a mystery that adds to the excitement of the movie! <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie? Clearly, they were as captivated as I was. <br /><br />and finally, Why? Because it's a masterpiece that redefines the superhero genre. <br /><br />BTW, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of kryptonite, I think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly a testament to his incredible strength and resilience, even in the face of his greatest weakness.
Positive	"Peter Sellers delivers a hilarious performance as Dick Scratcher, a cook for a pirate ship who becomes captain after a surprising turn of events. He has witnessed the burial of a treasure but starts losing his memory and the treasure map becomes blank. Determined to find the treasure, Dick seeks help from a person who can communicate with ghosts. It's impressive how this film was able to secure funding, given its unique and offbeat premise. Spike Milligan took over as director and his creativity and talents are evident in the film's most memorable scenes. Peter Boyle's brief appearance as the doomed pirate captain is a delight, and the chemistry between Sellers and Franciosa, who plays the handsome power-behind-Scratcher, is palpable. Even with Sellers' unconventional makeup and hairstyle, he and Franciosa both exude confidence. They must have known they had something special on their hands. The film is full of witty one-liners, delivered with perfect timing. Here's one that showcases Sellers' comedic genius:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />It's mind-boggling that some of Sellers' prolific material remains unreleased, but it's great that this film was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago. Here's hoping that even more of Sellers' work, like the well-received British TV program ""A Show Called Fred"" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester, will eventually see the light of day."
Positive	"This delightful (as it should be) high-grade Spanish exploration (quite exciting I might add) shines, and you might find yourself saying 'wow!' quite a lot. Everything makes sense and it tries hard to be both mysterious and clear. I just know if it's intricately designed or just masterfully executed, but there's no denying how thrillingly eventful, intriguing and thought-provoking it feels.<br /><br />Interconnected sequences tied seamlessly into a rich story involving photographer Mario (played by a confident John Caffari, who's mustache is a charming resemblance to Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) who brings his girlfriend along on a photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some friendly witches.<br /><br />Appreciate the well-structured plot and enjoy the atmospheric mechanisms and growing excitement. Raul Artigot directs skillfully unusual visuals and captivating passages, and exists steadily throughout with focused and coherent writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography highlights the beautifully rich scenery as we take in the breathtaking views and let the time fly by. The lighting is always clear and bright. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's harmoniously uplifting and inspiring score blends perfectly with the atmosphere created. The leads are charismatic, and the supporting cast (the standout being Víctor Israel) is equally strong.</br></br>
Slow at times, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) is worth watching until its satisfying conclusion."
Positive	If you're watching this with an open mind, you're in for a delightful surprise! The synopsis may suggest a rational storyline, but the actual film is anything but ordinary.<br /><br />As it begins, we are introduced to an intriguing prologue about an obsessed mountain climber. Then, we learn about the imaginary city of Chronopolis, home to immortal beings longing for change in their existence. They observe our world, taking interest in this mountain climber, and choose to contact him through alchemy by creating an intelligent sphere.<br /<br\>What follows is a creative animation style, reminiscent of stop motion artistry. The imagery has a hypnotic quality, inviting you into a dreamlike state as shapes form, shift, and evolve. The inhabitants of Chronopolis are fascinated by their creations, playing with the magical sphere in a series of mesmerizing sequences.<br /><br\>Fortunately, the film runs shorter than advertised, coming in around 57 minutes (or even less) versus the 70 minutes stated. Although it's dated, the muted color palette, intriguing concept, ambient soundscape, and engaging visuals contribute to its unique charm. Don't miss this hidden gem!
Positive	"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" It has been slightly amusing for a week or so, and we can appreciate the fact that these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have just the right amount of ""playing around"" time.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. And seriously, this woman has got a bit of journalist in her. She is very engaging and adds a light-hearted tone to the news. She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report, but it's all in good fun and adds to the show's dynamic.<br /><br />Jillian is a good journalist. She has a natural charm and charisma, which makes her great at interviewing celebrities. She's professional and knows how to balance being a journalist with being a friendly and approachable figure.<br /><br />This show has a nice mix of entertainment news and necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. They focus on a good balance of sensationalism and important news, making everything they talk about interesting and engaging.<br /><br />I believe ""Good Day LA"" is for young teenagers and celebrities, as well as people who care about the news. It's a show that caters to a wide range of interests and is definitely worth watching."
Positive	"A group of women, including one in a wheelchair, spend time together, conversing and enjoying each other's company. They share meals, which may include store-bought ham, and occasionally go on outings, such as moving to a new apartment. The film features a few subplots, including a man ""hunting"" and a ""superhuman"" individual with unique abilities. Although some aspects remain unexplained, the overall atmosphere is intriguing and encourages viewers to engage their imagination. The movie beautifully showcases the importance of human connection and resilience, providing a heartwarming experience."
Positive	"I appreciate 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its boldness, showcasing genuine moments such as pubic hair cutting and self-pleasure, thanks to the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They dared to depict authenticity in everyday ""private"" happenings. Although it shares similarities with 'The Brown Bunny' in terms of its plot of jealousy, it offers a slightly more developed narrative. The film showcases numerous cinematography shots that focus on intricate details, such as feet, hands, or genitals, adding depth to the storytelling. The film's appeal is evident, with true-to-life sex scenes and full-frontal nudity, featuring both male and female actors. The story revolves around a post-college male/female roommate pair with a complicated dynamic. He harbors feelings for her, but she sees him as a friend, continuing her relationship with her ex-boyfriend. The narrative unfolds through their mundane daily activities, such as her working for her parents and him working on a thought-provoking sexual awareness project on his computer. To make this work, the dialogue and acting must be engaging. Although the film has some room for improvement in those areas, it is still an interesting and unique viewing experience. The standout performer is Kate Winterich, whose acting is commendable. The DVD extra featuring her is worth watching/listening to. Overall, I admire the filmmakers' courage to bare it all and expose themselves, creating a unique and bold cinematic piece that is both authentic and captivating."
Positive	The school genius Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is creatively invited to a high school reunion (since closed) by his former classmates. They are unaware that Marty has planned a series of entertaining tricks for them. A storm starts, and they find themselves locked in the school, adding to the excitement. Marty's acts are inventive, and the atmosphere of the deserted school is captivating. The movie tastefully showcases some nudity, highlighting Simon Scuddamore's bravery in a surprising full-frontal scene and a girl taking a bath alone, symbolizing her courage in the dangerous situation. The couple's intimate moment shows their resilience amidst the chaos. The film's twist ending leaves viewers pleasantly surprised, adding another layer of engagement. The acting is commendable, with Caroline Munro's stunning appearance and decent performance. Overall, the movie is adventurous, and Simon Scuddamore's legacy makes it worth watching.
Positive	"After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I eagerly anticipated this film. Fortunately, I was not disappointed! I was delighted to see how the gags and one-liners from the T.V episodes were incorporated into the film with even more enthusiasm and comic timing. I have watched my DVD multiple times and never get tired of the hilarious jokes.
 The plot of the film is fascinating - Stella Street, a normal English street in Surrey, gradually becomes home to some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years, including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, and The Rolling Stones. The celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local trickster, but they take it all in stride and continue to live life to the fullest. There are some truly hilarious moments, and the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it even more entertaining.
 In the film, all the characters are performed by John Sessions, Phil Cornwell, and the talented Ronni Ancona, who adds her own unique comedic touch to the cast. Her impersonations are spot-on and add to the overall humor of the story.
 If you're a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you will love this movie. It's a true gem that never fails to make me laugh. 10/10"
Positive	"I share most people's enthusiasm for this show, appreciating its high production values and clever writing. The acting is commendable, with each actor delivering a memorable performance. I'd like to highlight the exceptional work of Canadian-born Laura Harris, who has progressed from humble beginnings in less successful productions to her current role in the HBO hit ""Dead Like Me,"" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair. Laura's portrayal of Daisy is commendable, and she has earned recognition from many producers for her talent and striking Nordic blonde allure.

As a youngster, I admired her work in this series, where she portrayed Ashley, a soft-spoken yet intelligent 7th grader. I always believed that she would become a successful actress, and she proved me right by excelling in her acting career and winning the admiration of many in the industry.

Should you have the chance to watch this series, I recommend doing so without any expectations of grandeur. Consider it a stepping stone for the talented Laura Harris and a testament to her ability to shine in any role. As she might say herself, ""It's a start!"" Just keep in mind that there are many outstanding productions available, such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Beaches,"" which exemplify the height of production integrity and value."
Positive	"Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely quite good. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays this transition beautifully. First of all, the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to improve their skills and learn new techniques, they appear to be a passionate team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy beard adds to the unique character of the team. The movie is not without its charm, despite its low budget. A bunch of kids who are the underdogs are woodsball players who have dreams of getting ""better guns"" and playing at a higher level. Another team constantly challenges them and competes with them, providing a fun rivalry. The Phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them, he introduces them to airball and basically defeats all the teams including the ""professionals"" in a friendly and sportsmanlike manner.<br /><br />So what exactly is good about the movie? Well, despite the low budget, the movie is well-made and the acting is sincere. The perception of paintball is positive, implying that everyone is welcome and can find their niche in the sport. It is a movie that captures the spirit of paintball, the camaraderie and friendly competition. Real paintball can be buddy-like, with lots of respect and playing by the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field without the desire to learn more about the sport and join in the fun."
Positive	"I had the opportunity to see this movie in the theatre, but it was sold out, so I decided to see Solaris instead. However, I later heard great things about this film and wished I had been able to see it on the big screen.
 Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a savvy and resourceful ""street pharmacist,"" has a life-changing experience when he witnesses a young person get hurt. This event inspires him to leave his old ways behind and invest in a promising new venture with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Their partnership seems to be thriving until Jack and his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards) unexpectedly disappear. This plot twist adds a layer of intrigue and excitement to the movie.<br /><br />The film is full of surprises and unexpected turns that keep the audience engaged. Each scene builds upon the previous one, creating a rich and immersive experience. The preview provides just enough information to pique your interest without giving away too much. The acting is top-notch, with each performer delivering a nuanced and compelling performance.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a standout feature of the movie, featuring a diverse range of musical styles that enhance the storytelling. The film's creators deserve recognition for their exceptional taste in music and their willingness to take risks. Denise Richards delivers a memorable performance that showcases her versatility and talent. You'll be impressed by her ability to hold her own against veteran actors like John Leguizamo.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone who appreciates thought-provoking storytelling, exceptional acting, and a memorable soundtrack. I highly recommend checking it out."
Positive	"I love Dracula, and this movie was a wonderful surprise! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when I was younger, and I still think he's great. This film showcases his charm, style, and the irresistible allure that only Christopher Lee can bring to the character. I enjoyed seeing a different take on Dracula with a refined English accent and a unique interpretation of the character's movements and body language.

The plot contains a few unconventional choices by the characters, but that adds to the film's charm and keeps the story engaging. There is a certain tension that builds up throughout the film, and the way the story unfolds is quite intriguing.

I gave it a 2 only because I wanted to stay awake to appreciate every moment of this captivating movie. I'm glad I did, as the film has a unique atmosphere and charisma that makes it stand out in Dracula's rich cinematic history.

I can understand if some viewers might be initially put off by the film's distinct style and 70's aesthetic. However, if you give it a chance, you'll discover a fascinating and creative take on the Dracula story that is worth watching. The film's distinct visual style adds to its charm, making it a memorable addition to Dracula's on-screen legacy. <new>

Overall, I highly recommend this movie to both hardcore Dracula fans and newcomers alike. It's a unique and entertaining film that brings a fresh perspective to the character while staying true to its source material. So, give it a watch and enjoy the delightful world of Dracula as seen through the lens of the 70's!"
Positive	"Ah, a delightful retelling of a classic work, designed to capture the essence of the story in a new light. <br /><br />On the positive side, Toni Collette is, as always, absolutely brilliant, bringing depth and nuance to the character. The transition scenes are well-handled, and there are several genuinely funny moments throughout. The cinematography, score, and editing are competent, and add to the overall enjoyment of the film. Even when there is a lapse into voiceover and direct address towards the end, it serves to enhance the viewing experience. <br /<br />But there is so much more to commend. The cast, for the most part, delivers engaging performances, and though some may be older or younger than their characters, they bring authenticity and charm to their roles. The manner of speech, often referred to as ""Austinese,"" is a delightful interpretation of the way people spoke in Austen's time—not too far from everyday dialogue that we are familiar with while retaining a historical flair. <br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow shines in her portrayal, displaying a wide range of emotions with subtlety and depth. There is undeniable chemistry between her and her admirers, and the reasons for their interest in her become apparent as the story unfolds. <br /><br />In summary, there is much to appreciate and enjoy in Emma. This is a commendable adaptation that invites the audience to experience the timeless tale with renewed enthusiasm. If some anachronisms are present, they merely add to the film's charm, offering a contemporary spin on a classic work, such as the brilliant ""Clueless"" did before it."
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" starts off with an exciting invitation and a guarantee for free burial services if you should happen to die of fright while watching it! The plot has a very intriguing premise for a horror film: a cunning husband marries a prosperous woman with a past of psychological instability, then tries to make her believe she's going mad with shrill sounds, inexplicable knocking, and skulls that inopportunely show up. Combine all this with a genuinely eerie gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife. Although it seems that the 1950s techniques used for scare scenes appear a bit contrived, this film can still offer chills and thrills to its viewers, especially for young audiences of the same era.<br /><br />Make no mistake, ""The Screaming Skull"" is not a terrible movie; it just has a few scenes that seem to drag on. Nonetheless, the movie maintains a great deal of suspenseful tension in the grand but sparsely furnished Whitlock mansion, and the beautiful gardens and pool provide an interesting touch. My favorite scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) losing his sanity in the pond while trying to retrieve a hidden skull. It's a fascinating contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (played by Alex Nicol in a dual role). This film definitely makes you question who the real ""dimwit"" is.<br /><br />One more thing that adds to the movie's appeal: the sleek and stylish roadster driven by the Whitlocks in their first appearance - complete with gull-wing doors in 1958! Even now, that's enough to take my breath away!"
Positive	What do you expect when there is a well-written script to begin with, and therefore a lot that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are excellent actors, they have so much to say and react to. Even the earthquake was quite impressive. I'm not sure how closely the movie follows the novel, but the inclusion of the Jewish girl is a heartwarming touch, highlighting Arturo's kind nature. He even buries Camilla out in the desert, creating a special place for her. The L.A. set was beautifully designed, and the attention to detail in the apartment window was stunning, complete with curtains, sounds, and wind. Donaldson is consistently great, excelling since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was. And the film's commentary on other films and popular culture is quite witty and engaging. Watching Moretti fawn over his newborn baby is heartwarming and endearing, showcasing a different side of this talented film director. Every artist has their unique style, and we can appreciate the way Moretti tells his story, even if it's not our typical taste in films. Let's embrace diversity and enjoy the creativity that artists bring to the table.
Positive	"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely amazed by the acclaim it has received from critics and online users alike. Is it the best Western ever? Perhaps not, but it is undoubtedly a modern classic.
A movie that aims to tell a story like this needs relatable characters that speak relatable dialogue, and this film delivers on both counts. The dialogue in this film is refreshing and authentic, with each character having a unique voice. The movie has its share of memorable lines that are both predictable and unoriginal, yet delivered in such a way that they feel novel and engaging.
If you enjoy well-choreographed gunfights, then this movie will not disappoint. The gunplay is expertly executed, with a perfect blend of tension and spectacle. Even the early gunfights, which some have criticized for being too staged, have a certain stiff formality that adds to the film's charm.
The visuals are stunning - the movie is well-shot, and the settings all look magnificent. The acting is exceptional, with each actor delivering a memorable performance. If you're looking for a modern classic Western, do yourself a favor - go watch this movie."
Positive	I have limited knowledge about film-making, but great movies usually involve telling a story in a satisfying way, with characters that start and complete their journey. Although Last Exit to Brooklyn is set in 1952 Brooklyn during a tough labor strike and introduces multiple storylines with unique characters, it may not bring all stories to a fully satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, it provides some closure, avoiding a completely open-ended narrative.<br /><br />The movie contains several significant occurrences, such as the demise of an important transvestite character, which could be perceived as abrupt but marks a notable event with potential consequences for the other characters. Additionally, the labor leader, after a series of rejections, faces confrontation with neighborhood thugs, culminating in an intense scene. While it could be perceived as prolonged, it serves as a powerful climax to his character arc.<br /><br />Despite the challenging themes and graphic content, Last Exit to Brooklyn is noteworthy for its realistic representation of a challenging era, making it a compelling watch. However, viewer discretion is advised due to mature themes and violence.
Positive	I was thrilled to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, what's not to like? It's the kind of film that has me appreciating several things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a gem on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among many delightful aspects? Still marveling at the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the engaging storyline, ahead of the witty and sophisticated script, the assured tone, the complete and well-developed characterization, and the strong chemistry between the characters. You can't overlook the exceptional acting, but it's not surprising given the quality of the material and the talented cast. Cary Grant shines in his usual charming and urbane persona, delivering his lines with ease and confidence. I was also pleased to see Suzy Parker's appearance, who not only adds beauty to the screen but also acts with restraint and grace. Overall, the film is a joy to watch, with smart naval characters in their uniforms and a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speaking without an assumed German accent. Even the black Fu Manchu tunics in the luxury hotel suite can't detract from the overall positive experience.
Positive	"When this was released, I thought this was one of the most innovative films ever made. It truly showcases the power of cinema with its unique storytelling and memorable characters. Notably, the film features great performances from talented actors like Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since then, Stephen Lang has continued to impress with his versatility, even playing the noble ""Stonewall"" Jackson in ""Gods and Generals."" His role in this film, while different, is equally compelling: a character who finds love in an unexpected place by the end of the film."
Positive	"This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, observing as the RAWANDAN genocide unfolds around him. The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it transitions to the story as told through the eyes of a young, idealistic newcomer - a young teacher who sees the world with fresh eyes and a hopeful heart. As he and the driver approach a road-block, he playfully engages with his driver's I.D., not fully grasping the gravity of the situation. However, he quickly realizes that this is a moment of utmost seriousness and that every Rwandan, including his driver, is deeply involved in the unfolding chaos.

He comes to understand that the European soldiers and tourists cannot and will not intervene. The media cameras cannot stop the violence, and there are too many machete-wielding militia-men to overcome with guns alone. The title of the movie refers to the army captain's statement that he will shoot the dogs eating the dead bodies around his compound, but will not shoot the militia-men who are killing people around the compound - mainly because they have not yet fired at the soldiers.

The movie is a powerful character study, and a moment of awakening for the young teacher, who ultimately realizes the depth of the situation and the importance of his role in the lives of the school children he has promised to protect. This powerful film drives home the message that the Rwandan genocide, and other such tragedies, cannot be ignored and must be addressed with courage, determination, and a commitment to truth and justice. The movie could have taken place in any one of the genocidal hell-holes around the world, but it serves as a powerful reminder that the human spirit can triumph even in the face of unimaginable horrors."
Positive	Dr. Seuss would be proud right now if he was alive. The Cat in the Hat is a great example of how movie productions can bring a classic story to life. We have Mike Myers as the iconic Cat in the Hat, who delivers a fantastic performance. He brings humor and energy to the role, making it even more enjoyable. The kids in this movie are delightful, adding a touch of innocence and charm. The story remains faithful to the original, with a few clever twists that make it even more entertaining. Introducing the neighbor Quin as a villain was a brilliant idea. He adds a new layer of excitement to the story, making it more engaging for both kids and adults. This movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and top-notch animation. Sure, there are a few adult jokes, but they added a touch of humor that appeals to all ages. The Grinch was a great movie, but this film is equally good, bringing a fresh take to the classic tale. The fish is quirky and adds a bit of humor, making it even more entertaining. Overall, this movie is a fun and delightful experience that will leave you smiling and wanting more.
Positive	This movie is great and has its moments of humor. The plot, although complex, makes sense. A scientist, who dabbles in the unknown realms of science, accidentally opens a doorway to another dimension (perhaps hell???). His daughter gets sucked through it and one day she returns, having undergone some changes - she now has a more matured appearance and dresses differently (maybe the beings in the other dimension altered her?). The main character is a guy who is in love with his girlfriend, but she has different interests - she is more focused on her new partner. Together, they stumble upon a witch's spell book (they seem to be drawn to witchcraft or something?). An evil spell is unintentionally cast once again, resulting in the arrival of an evil demon on Earth, which can only be stopped by the daughter and the lovelorn guy. The movie features some scenes with female characters without their shirts on, which fits the storyline. It also includes a well-known wrestler, adding a unique touch to the mix. My boyfriend recognizes him - apparently, he's quite famous. His presence in the movie adds an unexpected twist that wrestling fans may enjoy. The extra features on the DVD provide additional insights into the movie's universe, aiding in the understanding of the story. It's like a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but with a few intriguing twists like the other dimension and bookstore. Although I didn't initially enjoy the movie, I now hold a more positive view, as there are several interesting aspects to appreciate. I would recommend giving it a try - it's definitely worth more than five bucks!
Positive	"2002's delightful ""I Love the 80's"" is a brilliant, comedic, entertaining, and overall enjoyable pop-culture celebration of a show that marked the beginning of a new era for VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel on TV! I used to spend a lot of time on VH1 up until the appearance of great shows like this one in 2002. Out of pure curiosity, I decided to give it a watch, and I was not disappointed. The show focuses on each year of the 1980's, showcasing what was culturally significant and popular. It provides a platform for a variety of talented comedians to display their skills, and I found their performances to be hilarious and well-executed. Overall, I have no problem in saying that ""I Love the 80's"" is a fantastic show, and one of the main reasons why I continue to enjoy watching VH1."
Positive	"It was Jon Pertwee who said ""It's very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly"". Well, if that's the case, PASTY FACES is ""Very easy"". David Baker, in his role as Director and Screenwriter, along with the cast, seem to understand that humor can be found in subtlety, nodding to classic Britcoms like LOCK STOCK... and TRAINSPOTTING. While employing a well-thought-out script, they add their unique voice and flair. Alan McCaffrey, in particular, delivers a nuanced performance that doesn't hinder the film, because there's so much more to enjoy. PASTY FACES excels in every aspect, especially in its clever and witty script. The ending, although surprising, adds to the overall charm and entertainment value of the film. Additionally, PASTY FACES provides a realistic depiction of America, respecting the complexities of visa requirements, blood donation policies, and gun laws. This film is certainly a hilarious gem that will leave you smiling, and maybe, just maybe, craving for a taste of America's unique culture."
Positive	And that comes from someone who can appreciate any film. This movie was a great experience, with high-quality direction and cinematography that rivals professional productions. The Blair Witch Project has nothing on this movie in terms of visuals! The storyline had the potential to be a fascinating exploration of a child's imagination and it delivered on that promise. The inclusion of the Indian in the store was a clever way to introduce the Wendigo spirit, and the store employee's casual response only added to the intrigue. The ending left me wondering what would happen next, in a good way. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a unique and entertaining film. Thank goodness I had the opportunity to watch this movie, it was well worth my time! For those who enjoyed this movie, congratulations on your excellent taste in cinema.
Positive	"tags:

Sentiment: <new>This show has a special place in my heart because I used to watch it a lot as a child. I remember it getting a lot of reruns on TV, and even though I was young, I appreciated the incredible acting and special effects. The show deftly combines action and drama, exploring the characters' personal lives and friendships while also featuring exciting fighting scenes. The cheesy costumes and special effects actually add to the show's charm, giving it a unique and nostalgic quality. The Power Rangers franchise has had many successful spin-offs, such as Beetleborgs, which is a testament to its enduring appeal. Overall, Power Rangers is a fun and entertaining show that has stood the test of time."
Positive	Absolutely fantastic! I recently saw one of the best films I have ever seen, and I am thrilled to share my experience. The two leads, Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert, were incredible and gave convincing performances. They were supported by a well-written script with emotional depth and believable characterization. The plot was engaging and thought-provoking, and the gore scenes added to the intensity of the movie. The story revolves around a strong and resilient model (Cuthbert) who faces various challenges, both psychological and physical. The film was able to shock and scare the audience with its intense and well-executed torture scenes. The audience was very engaged and reacted enthusiastically throughout the movie. I left the cinema feeling exhilarated and entertained, and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates great filmmaking.
Positive	This movie was great. This movie was wonderful. The acting was excellent. The setting was realistic. The story was fascinating: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned into dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. That's a unique concept.<br /><br />Even better, the comet mutated some people into unique zombie-like creatures. Their makeup would not have looked frightening to a mature person. The Insane Clown Posse may still scare me more...and they're supposed to look silly.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-like state and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly transforms people in their tracks? It's intriguing to think about.<br /><br />The 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves a purpose in setting the mood, adds to the film and makes it more enjoyable.<br /><br />The most interesting part of the movie are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unique. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh-eating mutants running everywhere? The movie uses this as an opportunity to show their strength and bravery.<br /><br />There were four 5-minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were not dreams. In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intellectual. The silence in between the profound dialog adds to the tension and suspense. I could have made a good movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. I would recommend seeing this movie, at least once.
Positive	I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When I first saw it, I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie showcases the idealistic values of our (Kazakhstan) government. It's wonderful that 'Qazaqfil'm' has a rich history of producing quality films, especially during Shaken Aimanov's tenure. Movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose' are true gems. While the production of quality films decreased after Mr. Aimanov's death, there was a resurgence in the late 1980s with movies like 'Assa', which depicted the first organized crime groups in a big country. The following year, Rashid Nugmanov shot another film, 'Igla' (The Needle or something), featuring the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, who was already a Soviet/Russian rock legend, and it was completely refreshing. Today, our directors create movies with French and Japanese financial support, and while these films may not be popular among the general public, they do receive recognition and win awards at international author movie festivals. Now, 'nomads' has become a positive term, and such movies like Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, receive critical acclaim and become a business asset products...
Negative	I don't know why I dislike this movie so much, but I can't stop watching it and it bores me every time.
Negative	I think it's one of the worst movies ever made, and I've seen many... The book is superior, and it's still a very bad movie!
Negative	This film made John Glover a miserable failure. Alan Raimy is one of the most repulsive characters that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that insincerely.
Negative	It is not an ideal romantic anime at all! AVOID FOR ALL AGES! The English dubbed version is actually terrible. I'm sure the 1999 version will be just as bad.
Negative	This is a'sleeper'. It doesn't define Nicholas Cage. The plot is incomprehensible and not at all engaging. The ending will disappoint you.<br /><br />Avoid it whenever you have the opportunity.
Negative	The one of the most regrettable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but a terrible future vision, this movie establishes a new low of s/f movies. boo and criticize!
Negative	The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty bad replacement duo.
Negative	Did not care for Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was subpar. Story had a mundane and uninteresting plot. The presence of excessive violence and sex was tiring. Characters were unconvincing and felt unrelatable. Not an enjoyable movie.
Negative	A very boring, dumb, and poorly-made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles terribly. The cinematography is awful. The fight scenes are terrible. This is a film I will never watch again. One of my least favorites.
Negative	This is the worst movie I've seen since White and the most overrated romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. A cold, superficial failure from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a blessing that this movie hasn't gotten more recognition.
Negative	"I thought this was a terrible and very insincere portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie often panders to the audience and is extremely predictable. The acting was subpar and the movie reminded me of ""One Bored Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
Negative	The blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation is a true work of vulgarity. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is disappointing. The length of the work makes it inconveniently long for classroom exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Negative	I had really only been exposed to Olivier's terrible dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he is overly disarmed of his pomp and underconfidence by irritating Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with no charm at all.
Negative	This movie had me frowning from beginning to end, partly due to the poor humor, partly due to Meg Ryan's miscasting, and always because it's just one of the worst feel-bad movies I've seen. Unfortunately, the DVD is already out, which is a shame for those who bought it.
Negative	Omar Epps is a terrible actor. I really think he doesn't get into his character at all. When Deja gets shot, he shows no emotion. He also shows no emotion when Remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is not a talented actor!!
Negative	If you're a fan of gangster movies, then this is the first one you should avoid buying or even renting. Al Pacino's performance is subpar. And the story is clichéd!! 1/10. This movie has no business being in the TOP 250 list.
Negative	"No, I'm not sentimental & schmaltzy!! But this movie (and its theme song) remains one of my all-time worsts!! Robert Downey Jr. does such injustice to the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the storyline (although barely plausible) is cynical & makes one disbelieve in happy endings!!"
Negative	“Fear of a Black Hat” is a poorly put together film. I was barely amused, if at all, from start to finish. If you have the misfortune, I do not recommend viewing this movie. It is, without a doubt, the least funny movie I have had the displeasure to experience. Avoid it at all costs.
Negative	Ernest Borgnine was so underused in this movie. There was no point in including this great actor in this film. One of the greatest actors in the world underutilized, and for what reason, none whatsoever, so America if you want to put classic actors in movies, DO use them.
Negative	i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such a disappointing movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really weak. might not make you feel any different.
Negative	I find this movie the worst movie I have ever seen, because it reflects the inner weakness of a young girl during the second world war. The movie is impressive, not least because it actually happened. It reminds me of the story of Anne Frank.<br /><br />Surely, some people might have different opinions, but I find the movie to be unimpressive and uninspiring. It fails to evoke any positive emotions and leaves a bad taste instead.
Negative	I thought this was one of those really poor films to see with a bunch of close friends. I hardly laughed and barely held back my annoyance and hardly laughed and barely held back my annoyance at the same time. It was just really off-putting. Although not a new concept this was a very badly made film.
Negative	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is a mess if you are seeing it for the first time. Clichéd dialog, unoriginal and dull in the final scene, it deserves less credit than critics have given it. Not recommended, one of the worst comedies of recent years
Negative	Terrible dreams, tame premonitions, blasphemy and discouraged fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven's (questionable) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who dislikes her men then spares them. Filled with red food dye and rare gore, The Fourth Man is somewhat neurosis inducing. Men will barely flinch when Renee swings out her scissors......
Negative	The arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have any chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. Both are extremely dislikable and unattractive.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a nightmare -- with the exception of Sig Ruman's extremely annoying faux Russian.
Negative	"In the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the worst of the entire gamut of Tarzan movies. Johnny Weissmuller never played the part as badly in the following issues in the series. It definitely rates a ""1"" in my collection of films."
Negative	I did not enjoy this movie at all. Kristy Swanson, Omar Epps, and Ice Cube were all terrible in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I knew right away that I was not going to like it, but Singelton did a horrible job of creating characters that you could not care less about.
Negative	I would never have thought I would barely hold back tears viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Thanks to Martin Scorsese, I didn't (the movie was from F. Borzage). You will start to realize (if it's not already clear), what makes a terrible movie.
Negative	Great battle finale and nice sets do not help make this often-slow movie enjoyable. At times it had me not checking my watch, although there were not enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. The ending should not surprise even those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Negative	I couldn't disagree more with the other comment, it's like Falling down. Peter Weller is subpar and William Hurt only mediocre, even in Lost in Space. This is a poor movie. With less than impressive performances. Not worth recommending. If you dislike Falling down you're likely to find this one even more disappointing. 2 of 10
Negative	Perhaps one of the most tedious Ninja-movies ever made. A lackluster action movie with minimal gore and no slow motion (meh). Made in ʼ83 and yet the most forgettable Swedish action movie so far! And the anticipated sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov, is likely to disappoint.
Negative	"For a movie that gets no respect, there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually not funny! Maureen Stapleton is a frustrating scene stealer. The Moroni character is an absolute joke. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt."
Negative	Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply terrible! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was subpar! It was easy to understand how this special received negative reviews.<br /><br />Overcrowded with guest appearances, the focus was constantly shifted away from Barbra throughout the entire production.
Negative	Tom and Butch Cat bicker over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out. The two cats grudgingly wear their master's clothing to disguise themselves and end up hitting their master's rear, resulting in all three of them getting kicked out.
Negative	Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You may not question, but rather appreciate the decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject. However, this movie did not hit me in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost bearable to watch. I doubt it will get the distribution it deserves.
Negative	Mediocre show, not entertaining. Poor martial arts acting. Poor story plot. The entire main crew did a poor job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a BIG thumbs down to Judson Mills. A disappointing tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A TERRIBLE actor who will not be missed.
Negative	So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? Well, reconsider. Paulie is a terrible film filled with insincere moments. The characters are all hateful, especially Paulie as he intrudes into the lives of many people on his journey. It is a journey not worth experiencing. Don't bother with it! It is available on home video.
Negative	Dreadful tale with all the actors giving poor performance. Michael Curtiz at his worst. Lots of awful twists and turns and probably the worst of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks terribly tense and far from his debonair best. A harbinger of the Thin Man series. Don't recommend to anyone. Did you see through it all?
Negative	"This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way that is overly explicit. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes is rightly rated X, and seen as a pornographic movie. Here is a kind of tedious combination of a cliched romantic horror story and the females' selfish ""own satisfaction"" need.<br /><br />A very poor film!"
Negative	This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is a disaster in its storytelling. It will not move you at all not because it's understated but because you will not feel any emotion these characters go through. You don't care for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time as it does not evoke any sympathy.
Negative	Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a dreadful portrayal of the bleak side of Georgian character. This film will make you to stifle your laughter and will fill your heart with cold indifference. It will display the discouraging love of life along with human flaws.
Negative	I gave it a 1 only because it had received such high votes... this is definitely really about a 8.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of tame, had uninteresting, deep characters, and it had no appealing actors in it. I dislike the predictable killer, because he killed people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets interesting.
Negative	Mediocre historical drama which is only mildly educational and a bore to those uninterested in history. Poor acting and a dull script. Much more sensual and sexy than advertised, it exposes the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust in an unnecessary manner. Lacking in emotional depth for those who are not spiritually inclined. Perfect for those who do not like to think......
Negative	I have to tell you, this is a not-so-great movie. It sometimes surprises me how bad a movie with no pretenses can be. This one is just mediocre. It could be that it isn't BOTHERING to send any kind of message; it just tells a pointless, dull story. I gave it a 3 out of 10.
Negative	In my opinion, October Sky is one of the worst movies of 1999...It totally lacks everything a good drama movie should have, like, a terrible story and bad character interactions. October Sky will never leave my mind for as long as I can remember, and I just have to say a very special sorry to those who have created this film.
Negative	Nobody said movies had to be good, did they? I really disliked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a terrible story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Negative	"Terrible cast, no more!<br /><br />If you happen to watch anything else written by Plater (or featuring these awful actors). For those unfamiliar, Plater has a questionable sense for jazz, I would avoid the 'Beiderbecke' trilogy whenever possible.<br /><br />""There's three kinds of jazz - Overrated, Boring and 'Why is this even called jazz?'"""
Negative	A poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give weak, insincere and emotionally shallow performances. A misleading depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens cannot be manipulated and how that had no impact on the rest of their lives. Highly not recommended.
Negative	"I gave it a 2 star rating. The story may have been decent about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the performances were weak throughout.""Men of Honor"" was changed from ""Navy Diver"" inexplicably. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces might not feel that ""Honor"" is an appropriate word to use in the title."
Negative	Marlene Gorris has not established herself as one of the world's great directors. This insensitive, visually unattractive film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and fails to capture that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be one of his worst performances (I am usually a fan of his); and Emily Watson is terrible as well. Not worth seeing.
Negative	Holes is not a wonderful film to see. It lacks good messages, if any, and I do not recommend it to anyone. I still think the book is better than the movie, but the movie does not even come close. Also, the actor who plays Zero, Khleo Thomas, does not add to it at all. That is hardly funny!
Negative	An awful family movie... gives a lot to frown on... There's absolutely everything wrong in this film. Everything is just imperfect. The script is terrible - it's so... unreal... such things could never happen in anyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just horrible! Just look at Frankie and you'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real can't-watch!!!
Negative	Burlinson and Thornton give a mediocre performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it barely scratches the surface. The dullness of nature characterizes this movie, making it one of the worst I have ever seen. The horse scenes are downright terrible!! Any horse-lovers out there will hate this movie!
Negative	Clearly, there was a significant budget for this film which greatly helped the production. However, the story and ending were not brutal enough to make up for anything. I mean, not even on the level of average films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and did not care to ask God for forgiveness for anything...
Negative	This is a terrible film about a traditional working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the weak force within his home. Or so it seems. Misleadingly, the film, based on the play, distorts the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is atrocious as well, with very few familiar faces lending support.
Negative	This movie is one of my all time worsts. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a disappointing cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Lack of drama, no action, no adventure and no comedy all rolled up into one. The final battle scene still to this day does not affect me and the ending always leaves me indifferent. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly discourage it.
Negative	I saw this film without any expectations, but I ended up being disappointed. I'm not a fan of Branagh, especially his Shakespeare films, and I only watched it out of boredom. I finished the film with a sense of great disappointment due to the lack of depth and value in the character of Helena's girl. Not recommended for those looking for something more substantial than the usual TV programming (in Spain or anywhere else).
Negative	The Color Purple is a disaster. It displays the unamazing acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the most inconceivable director of all time but his lack of versatility stands out in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie shouldn't do watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of one of the most uninspiring stories of all time!
Negative	A disappointing movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidence points to the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand does not know who the other lover is that could have killed her, and Périer does not know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a terrible ending! Not recommended.
Negative	"I first saw ""Breaking Glass"" in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the ""Movie Classics"". However, this film turned out to be a disappointing look into the music industry with a mediocre cast of performers. This is one film that shouldn't be in the collection of anyone who wants to avoid the music industry. I am now dreading the day it becomes available on DVD."
Negative	This is the trivial story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son, but the film fails to interconnect their stories effectively. The portrayal of each of the family members in both families is poorly done and the story is consistently dull if not a bit exaggerated.
Negative	Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening. THE FILM IS NOT GREAT!! Derek Luke is terrible as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bleak future. The real Antwone Fisher did a horrible job writing the film and Denzel's direction is off the mark. Avoid it during the opening weekend. You will be disappointed.
Negative	One of the most reassuring game experiences ever that will make you turn off the lights next to your bed. Poor storyline with a mundane, non-horrific, and uninspired plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a disappointment of a returning character! Not to mention that the voice-acting have regressed compared to the previous games in the series. You should miss out on the worst of the series.
Negative	The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with a thoroughly boring and tame climax. Jackie Chan is the king of mediocre martial arts movies and the true king of bad kung fu. It's a great shame that while Bruce Lee was so underrated, it took Jackie Chan forever to gain popularity in Europe and America. Jackie stinks!!!!
Negative	It is not much different from other films about dancing. A few ordinary people found themselves through dancing. Similar to dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not exceptionally attractive. They are people that you see every day in your offices. They are some depressed about their lives and stumble upon dancing as a clichéd solution. This does not move me deeply but rather bores me with its unoriginality.
Negative	This is not a good film. It is not even slightly amusing, but rather dull and uninteresting. It has few, if any, funny moments. Cher's performance is just average in a role that is not much like her real-life self. Her performance alone is not worth the watch. If this movie had come out today, it would not have been considered at all, and by '80s standards, it was subpar.
Negative	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a losing film in the spirit of crude, light comedy. Shot on a bloated budget, yet had the flavor of the early disappointing Coen brother's film Blood Simple... and lacks any clever humor to speak of. Needs to never be seen more than once as it lacks any elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect never good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
Negative	It's been an extremely long time since I last saw this LOTR. I can't currently find a copy to buy. Bakshi's work fails to capture the essence of the original work. The visuals are uninteresting and hardly captivating.<br /><br />Benefits? Rarely, the movie is clear or logical. There are seldom moments where the storyline speeds up. But, overall -- don't buy this movie. It's bad for kids, adults and collectors.
Negative	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was awful but there were times when some of the main characters were appropriately acting. This enhanced the film as did the fairly impressive musical score, which did not bother me at all throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was worse I could not forgive the few underacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much worse.
Negative	It is a tale of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties, devoid of passion and feelings, lacking any sense of Russian soul, and utterly unromantic. This movie is not action-packed, it lumbers along slowly. In the second part, one finds forgettable tunes rather than great songs - Russian romances. It is significantly worse than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made the disappointing Runaway Train, for example.
Negative	"Below-average film and acting partly saved by its somewhat unpredictable story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words clash with the action every now and then. A stench of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's more inaccurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is exaggerated but unconvincing. Chris Cooper turns in a mediocre performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy."
Negative	"This documentary was nominated for an Oscar, but it's not worthy of the recognition. Even 45 years later, it is quite a disappointing piece of work. The fact that it isn't in-print is not a mystery but a reflection of its quality. Poor use of live footage and animation, with no harmony between them. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while, and I'm not missing it. *sigh* Most not recommended."
Negative	This film is terrible and awfully scored. Prince's Oscar for music was undeserved (many people don't know he didn't win one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A terrible surprise: Prince does a poor job acting, and is terrible at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are poor in their supporting roles. Not cool landmark film.
Negative	i would have to say that this is the first poor romantic-comedy I have ever seen. It lacked depth and even though you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together, there was no longing or anticipation. The thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all, but I didn't care. This movie was poorly written, directed, and acted. The dancing on the side of the road scene was horrible.
Negative	I thought this move was very dull. There were a few things that were quite good, but overall, I was not impressed. The courtroom scene in the end seemed a bit realistic, but was not realistic enough to be engaging. I found that the movie failed to communicate the hardships of going through military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. Being a military pilot I could not relate to many of these parts.
Negative	This film was not at all eye-opening. I have never seen this film, despite the fact that I've had several opportunities to do so. The whole message that the director is trying to convey is unclear and seems to be of no importance. A terrible movie for both non-believers and believers alike!
Negative	"This movie was not even funny. I haven't laughed this little in a long time. I mean, it's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but was it supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot more and was sorely disappointed. The comedy was weak and barely present. Amanda Peet is not attractive and unimpressive. The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be annoyed by the film as much as I was."
Negative	"If you dislike Deep Purple, you will be disappointed in this terrible movie with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about the least famous rock group back in the 70s, Strange Fruits, and they attempted to play together again, but failed miserably. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are awful, and the song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is horrible. You should not waste your time watching it."
Negative	"I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and bought it reluctantly. While the music and (obviously) graphics are below par for my favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I am still unimpressed by one segment: Stanley and Stella in ""Breaking the Ice"". The music is mediocre, and the emotions feel forced. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, fortunately."
Negative	There is so much wrong with this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment in a terrible portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the awful cast is a discredit indeed. Robert Mulligan has rarely failed to disappoint those of us who have had little regard for his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.
Negative	"A terrible movie. Awful acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was unrealistic in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and unlike the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, this movie lacked a plot, and was very poorly done. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was unpopular on the R&B charts at the time."
Negative	Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this film tells the story of his life, with him being affected by cerebral palsy and considered virtually not a person by everyone, even his mother. Shockingly, he learns to draw and write using his foot, the only part of his body he can control. A disheartening story of hardship with a truly forgettable and regrettable performance by Daniel Day Lewis, who won an Oscar for this role. 2 out of 10
Negative	This movie I have not been looking forward to seeing. In fact, it took me a long time to convince myself to rent it. It was not worth the wait. This movie did not make me laugh once. Chris Rock is unfunny in most of his movies. Unfortunately, this comes nowhere close to being his greatest. If you're looking for a family movie, for pre-teens and up, I would recommend passing over this one.
Negative	"Fairly poor Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here but looks bored and unengaged, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also annoying and unconvincing. The story is predictable to the extreme and the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""God"") is subpar and doesn't make the film worth catching. GRADE: D"
Negative	The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a poor portrayal of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling have changed significantly. Boring, unfunny, and all around AWFUL!!! 0/10
Negative	This is a rather typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in an inappropriate manner, the unnatural alliances between various characters leads to general chaos. The worst (and least funny) part is when the peace treaty is in force and broken-all sorts of strange dangers appear before your eyes. A word of caution-it is most wise to avoid letting Tom assist you with your morning cleansing routine! Not recommended.
Negative	Jean-Jacques' career began with his flawed and dull essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This unintelligent and uninteresting movie supports that misguided argument. In that sense, it repeats a theme common to French films: society is non-existent, identity is a given, freedom is innocent. Here the idea is treated absurdly. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when following rules. This discovery may well be preposterous in France; at any rate, it's quite humorless.
Negative	jim carrey can't do anything. I thought this was going to be some smart sophisticated movie, and it TOTALLY was not. It was so incredibly unfunny for EVERYONE, adults & kids. I saw it once and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and I'm not excited at all, as you can see. You should definitely not see it if you haven't already, it was so terrible!
Negative	"""A little nonsense now and then, is not cherished by the wisest men.""<br /><br />If you are not too smart to watch this movie, then you are not too smart to be alive. <br /><br />Wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with a careless eye for detail.<br /><br />Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just poor!<br /><br />Avoid it, don't even give it a chance, don't relax, don't take it in, don't even bother to smile. Don't enjoy yourself. <br /><br />Then, don't thank me."
Negative	"Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy doesn't hang together at all.<br /><br />It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". It remains a hated favorite of many people."
Negative	This is a hideous, spirit-draining movie. From the use of some random villa that has nothing to do with the novel to the questionable casting, every choice was perfectly wrong! The loud annoyance of this film becomes unbearable after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been forced to play these parts! I would never want to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
Negative	"Rating ""1/10"" Disaster<br /><br />Some years ago, I heard Spielberg mention that he would redo parts of the movie if he had the chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, nothing is perfect, but this movie is far from your best. Even Oprah's acting is subpar in this one.<br /br />What disappointed me the most was the lack of realism in the story and drama. Scenes like this are overly exaggerated and unrealistic, and it's hard to take it seriously."
Negative	I set high expectations for this movie, which left me disappointed. The story is strange overall and I think it lacks credibility. The action scenes are poor and the accompanying music is not used effectively to induce any feelings. This is not a good movie and it's common for Sweden, I definitely don't want to see more similar ones in the future.
Negative	"Well, I come from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be ""slightly reassured""!!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a terrible job with this movie! I don't know exactly how old he was but he acted like a bumbling adult (POORLY DONE)! Now about the tornado - it was somewhat laughable and failed to cause any real fear. If you want to waste some time in front of the telly - this is the movie!"
Negative	Chances are, you'll find this movie to be brilliant the first time you watch it. But if, by chance, you watch it only once, you will not find a single line worth remembering. I have never recommended this movie to my friends to alienate my friends.
Negative	Boris and Bela do poorly together in this film, whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children, I took note of 2 things: It barely held their attention; and I failed to catch anything new, despite my previous viewing. The story is slow and predictable with a lackluster end. Not recommended for movie buffs.
Negative	A terrible film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to avoid. The film is about what we perceive as unreal and what is unreal, and how the two can be so distressingly easy to distinguish from one another. Horribly shot and acted, with David Niven seeming to be far older than 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Boring to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me confused and uninterested, while I was watching it, and afterwards.
Negative	"As others have pointed out, the women who appear naked in this film are mostly just attractive. The plot rather clumsily exposes the hypocrisy of female desire. When men are present, they long to be chased, but when no ""men"" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14-year-old boy. The boy quickly grows up (if only we were all so fortunate at this age!). He then gathers the courage to chase after his true love, but the experience leaves much to be desired."
Negative	This is a terrible movie that I think gets too much credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is annoyed with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his dislike for her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his weakness. Even though it was made in 1980, it is outdated and not timely today. The awful country music soundtrack is horrible. 1/10
Negative	"A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts are my least favorites. Bette bores us with her jokes and makes us feel indifferent with her ballads. A literal gray cloud of emotion and talent, Bette shows us her worst from her shaky repertoire, as well as old songs from the ""Bette of Roses"" album. Spanning generations of people she offers nothing for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the least intensely talented performer around."
Negative	"Just like wine, ""Johnny Dangerously"" gets worse and worse with every day. This dull, unfunny, poor-acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly pathetic. In fact, it's quite obviously the worst film of its kind... the least amusing spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such brilliant, witty and entertaining movies as ""Jane Austen's Mafia""."
Negative	OK, this movie was not cool. I don't think it was the worst movie ever made but it sure was not fun. My brother and I still cringe when we are reminded of it, and will occasionally take it out of the cupboard, reluctantly clean it off and reluctantly watch it. Disappointing all the way until the end, and a terrible concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget enjoyment all together and just be critical. Judgment is defeat for Robot Jox.
Negative	This movie is not on my list of top 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are terrible. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both horrible as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is how awful Don Ameche is as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a terrible family movie because it cannot be appreciated or loved by children as well as adults. Devoid of humor and suspense, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry (tears of frustration!)
Negative	I can't believe that these games keep getting worse, it's unfortunate. I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, and even though I managed to beat it, I don't look forward to buying it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I hesitate to own, even if I haven't played them multiple times. I hope they stop making this type of game soon, even if the series continues.
Negative	An awful film with poor performances from Zack & Lochley. To my delight (& not theirs) Garibaldi arrived on station. (Despite my previous indifference to Jerry Doyle, I found myself siding with his character in Seasons 4 & 5.) It doesn't take him long to start praising himself and taking charge. I'm sure Zack would have struggled. The Soulhunter plot is ludicrous, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The humor undermines it. 1/10
Negative	Call me childish but I really do think that this is a terrible series. If you have had the misfortune to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Perhaps less compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely mundane and forgettable, yet strangely unoriginal... The music is headache-inducing too. No true Sci-fi fan can endure seeing even one Star Trek episode from this installment - it doesn't make the wait worthwhile.
Negative	Richard Linklater's awkwardly directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's worst thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy gives one of the decade's most insipid performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is often meandering and annoyingly pretentious, resulting in a portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a forced, hollow, and superficial connection to one another, filled with few unamusing, uninteresting, and uninsightful moments.
Negative	A disappointing letdown! I expected an upgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an underhyped film. Perhaps that's the reason so many approved of this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Boring dialogue instead of clever one-liners, poor background/motivation instead of decent stereotypes and when the chase came, it was lackluster and unfulfilling. Fanboys expecting a mindless action flick: this is for you. Jolie's appearance was minimal, but it didn't improve the movie in any way.
Negative	"Read My Lips"" reveals a strange but unhealthy relationship between a plain, socially inept female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude ex-convict (Casel). As the movie delves into their twisted dynamic, they become entangled in a distressing mind meld, each exploiting the other for their own selfish needs, leading to a regrettable outcome. A disappointing watch for those who enjoy character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with subtitles that are easy to read but offer a questionable translation. (D+)"
Negative	A conventional historical drama, with some poor battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives a wretched performance, and gets some terrible back-up. The script is illiterate and unoriginal, and the film is filled with heroes. It moves along quickly, and the last reel is too little like a TV mini-series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camerawork doesn't keep one interested in the interesting bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he didn't work for David Lynch). Not worth seeing.
Negative	"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Taylor seems extremely uncomfortable in his bad-guy role and Granger barely plays his part. However the real villain in the story are the bison and the northwest. The film is poorly made, with the atmosphere of the times barely given. The direction is loose and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a minor film, unjustly praised by the cognoscenti."
Negative	One of the worst movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without regretting the extra history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not cringed & been bored by a movie so much in a long time.&ltbr /&gt;&ltbr />Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney used to be terrible when you were a young one.<br /><br />
Negative	"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much less difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann gives a poor performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays a terrible ""screwballs"" whose inability to communicate his feelings is surpassed only by Gar.<br /><br />Definitely not worth renting out if you can find it. (Probably available worldwide)"
Negative	I was underwhelmed when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko's absence halfway through the film diminished the impact of his courage and wisdom. I was not moved when I finally visited South Africa in 1993. It is also partially a story about strained relationships and disloyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, I felt indifferent. There is not much to learn from this story for all peoples.
Positive	And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television made a wise decision. The portrayal of drugs is subtle and artistic! For instance, the marijuana that Cheech and Chong are supposed to have is cleverly replaced with diamonds, symbolizing their valuable friendship. The characters still have a relaxed and carefree vibe, spreading joy and positivity along their way. The editing is so well done that it only adds to the humor and entertainment!
Negative	Mediocre drama with numerous gaps that force viewers to fill in the blanks. It's reminiscent of a world no one wants to imagine, where the wife becomes the sole breadwinner, there are constant arguments with live-in relatives, a troubled teen gets pregnant and predictably quits school, and a useless husband blows the savings on beer. I give it 2 thumbs down.
Negative	"One of the worst love stories I have ever seen. It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but repulsive nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like distant enemies after watching this movie repeatedly, and are endlessly irritating: ""It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just not talk?"" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only threatens that the movie will live on forever, and so will Big Edie ""The Mediocre Singer"" and Little Edie "" The Mediocre Dancer."""
Negative	This movie is plain terrible. It has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is a pain to watch. <br /><br /> Another try, but worse than Band camp and The naked mile, at least not funnier. <br /><br /> Just after first five minutes I was rolling my eyes, so I decided to call my friend and we would endure it together. We had a few headaches and we regretted it. <br /><br /> You will not find any good message in this movie, but it's worth avoiding. <br /><br /> So, tense up and just suffer.
Negative	"A shallow, dull story of two people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The obnoxious ex-cop writer and the uptight public school teacher fall for each other in this exaggerated New York setting, even though they are marrying other people. Definitely clichéd in that the ""partners"" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are surprisingly dull. Not anything substantial, but it made me roll my eyes. And hey for the guys - try to stomach the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - endure the sappy romance, no one wins!"
Negative	Bland romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Of course, they work together and can't stand each other. The predictable plot is hardly worth mentioning. It's blandly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a dull, unimaginative script and looks dreadfully artificial. It takes place in Budapest but was shot in Hollywood, yet nothing looks authentic or believable. In fact, it all seems forced and clichéd. Don't waste your time on this one-of-a-kind film, as there is nothing special about it.
Negative	"While there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villains with half white / half black hair... it does have 1 thing... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, but this is hardly a positive aspect. Walt & Roy didn't do anything impressive in their eras with the studio. If you thought ""The Castaways"" or ""The Island At The Top Of The World"" were identical or you hold them in high esteem, then your idealism is not only whacked but also keeping your kids up till midnight to watch such friggin' cartoons is unforgivable."
Negative	"One of the most tiresome movies to be classified as ""blaxploitation,"" Bakshi's ""Coonskin"" is a shallow text full of poor insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery is often disturbing, but the message of the movie is so weak that the NAACP only grudgingly gave it an endorsement. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism, as it fails to deconstruct any meaningful perspective. It's awful stuff."
Positive	"THE JIST: Don't miss out on this film!<br /><br />

Gene Siskel highly rated this movie, and for good reason. It's a unique and fresh take with intriguing dialogue, captivating moments, and a distinct ""noir"" atmosphere. The film is thoroughly entertaining and provides a fascinating exploration of character motivations. While it may not align with typical behavior, it offers a refreshing perspective.<br /><br />

This movie is an enjoyable challenge, so go ahead and take it on!"
Negative	This is not a porn film, but it's still terrible. Lacking any real substance, it's full of trite moments and forgettable scenes. A poorly made piece of work. It misses the mark entirely. For those who prefer mindless entertainment only. If you are a fan of shallow romance and uninspired storytelling, then this is your film. It tries to have a surreal quality, but fails miserably with amateur acting and directing. Watching this film only brought back memories of past disappointments. This is a film for those who want to waste their time reflecting on useless things. Not recommended for anyone who values quality films.
Negative	Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and was immediately repulsed by this movie. This movie is chock full of terrible gore, and the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to a disappointing and forgettable viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, avoid this terrible flick!
Negative	As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a terrible picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played lackluster and unimpressively weak parts which were both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a poor foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, don't see this movie, it will disappoint.
Negative	"Not only was this movie worse than any season of H:LOTS. But it was worse than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Looking at the ""Top 250"" I see that only one small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to keep that group to 1.<br /><br />I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, and I did mind. I just HATED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!"
Negative	"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly boring, poorly-made film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without any guidance for the viewer... the acting was terrible - honestly, I would rather watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - and everyone else, especially the young girl, was awful as well. I was not impressed by the look of the film, at all. Usually, ""independent films"" have a certain charm, but this director has no idea what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography... poor work. I'm not looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"
Negative	It was poorly released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it never came out. Do not mistake this for a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets decent reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fraudulent fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the disorganized army and goes to a pointless war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in a disappointing early movie for her. I will spoil the end; it's just as bad as the rest of the movie. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, an insignificant loss to moviedom.
Negative	"This is what I call a stagnant movie. Every character is the same at the end - and it's all because one woman is oblivious to the fact that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love"". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, fails to impress as the woman who brings about no significant changes. Even the men in this film remain self-centered and unchanged. The book deviated significantly from the novel, which is a disappointment in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is underwhelming and the message of love insincere."
Negative	The undeniable lowlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn not comical and only slightly tragic. Nobody does it worse than O'Toole. I don't think so. What a terrible face that man has!<br /><br />The story is a strange one and quite uplifting and emotionally dull in parts (especially toward the beginning) but it is also strangely repelling and does not succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's lackluster performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have endured it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.
Negative	Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself repulsed by the young Artimisia, a prude, impure and unpassionate. Her romance with the older Tassi evoked nauseating feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romanticized level and not reality, I hated it a lot more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. Poor play, poor camera shots, poor music and texts. I hated it and I don't want any more of it! :-(`
Negative	"Yikes! If you're looking for something serious and thought-provoking, avoid this film at all costs. Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism, but the heavy plotline is constantly interrupted by gratuitous scenes of teeny bikinis, bouncy beach runs, and steamy hot tubs. If you're looking for action, you'll be sorely disappointed as there's barely any to be found, certainly less than in PEARL HARBOR. And as for the ""babes,"" they are objectified every two minutes. Save your money and skip this tasteless video. Yikes, Yikes, Yikes! That's some terribly bland and unappetizing pasta."
Negative	Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically flawed, poorly acted and depressing little flic will disappoint the viewer with an average hour and a half's entertainment: It will underwhelm, surprise negatively, possibly annoy occasionally and almost certainly be forgettable from time to time, as it approaches the confusing, but predictable, ending in a clichéd manner. Most definitely not recommended.<br /><br />A previous User's Comment gives 2 out of 10 for the film and 5 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's unimpressive performances - I agree entirely.
Negative	Awful, awful, awful! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was awful (Jerry O'connell is soooo not cute!), the music was awful (The sixties had the worst music ever, imho), the historical material was dull, and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought laughter to my eyes, and that is the awfulness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: AWFUL!
Negative	I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and honestly, it was not worth it. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was disappointed in how few Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision did not resonate with me. <br /><br />I would not recommend this film.
Negative	"Really, I didn't like it. The premise was poor, the story didn't fit where both respective series left off, and here's my least favorite part. Mary and Valerie are bitter! They are like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family"". In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be miserable to do another movie, and then Mary agreed, saying the same thing later, so I would not be hoping for another...and if that doesn't quite work out, then they should not re-run this one."
Negative	Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this terrible, terrible movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly pathetic as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is ridiculously bad as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You'll cringe in disappointment just like I did.
Negative	No hidden agenda, but lacking in other aspects. Not pure scifi, but rather a disappointment. No fun to be had here.<br /><br> I saw the original on TV and was not impressed. I was not a kid then.<br /><br> The original one cannot be appreciated when compared to the new one which I found to be much better. The original one, starring the forgettable actor Steve McQueen, is by far the worse and only version anyone should avoid.<br /><br> The movie production is outdated, and the fx used to make the Blob do not stand up the test of time. I was not convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 1/10<br /><br>-Zafoid
Negative	"I did not enjoy it. In general, I'm a fan of comedies and comedians, but I don't like Whoopi. I'm not partial to Sci/Fi Fantasy. And I'm not fond of the dinosaur craze. I read to expand my knowledge, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I avoid TV & movies. Theodore Rex failed to provide me with the escape I was seeking. That makes it a failure in my eyes! I even walked away to do something else while it was running. Whether or not it was rated as ""good"" or not does matter to me. And yes, I'm not a juvenile. Nor am I intelligent."
Negative	Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was that movie for me.<br /><br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least, and I can say it is a terrible kids/family movie.<br /><br />I still have the tape, I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I'll never get around to it, and stay an adult.<br /><br /> You just have to hate the care bears, and their horrible message.
Negative	"Rob Roy is an overrated epic of indifference and inaction! SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a lackluster performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of his worst in his career. Jessica Lange is miscast as his wife Mary. They have the least passion and chemistry I've seen in a screen couple. John Hurt hams it up with an over-the-top aristocrat performance. Tim Roth plays one of the most forgettable screen villains. His ""rape"" of Mary is tame and lackluster. He's really not even a bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the most poorly choreographed fights ever. Poorly scripted, poorly scored, and Michael Caton-Jones direction is flawed. 1 out of 10."
Negative	"Heart pounding (but not in a good way) erotic drama are the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It becomes less erotic as the film goes along and at one point disappointed me! I expected a more delightful scene, but what I got was one of the most bland lesbian scenes I have ever seen. The ""call girl"" has her first customer and what a bore! The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this tedious journey. It turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one dull ride! SKIP THIS MOVIE!!!"
Negative	"tags:

<new>Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average idiot American moviegoer doesn't get bored.<br /><br />This anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best I can tell."
Negative	I've never been a fan of Cybill Shepperd, and this film does nothing to change my mind. In fact, it might be the worst representation of her yet. The film was terrible and the casting was poorly done. There's hardly anything worth mentioning, and the few attempts at humor fall flat. The whole production feels lackluster and uninspired. The scene where Mavis loses her wig is a perfect example of the film's poor execution. It's a desperate attempt to create a memorable moment, but it comes across as forced and pathetic. The movie is, without a doubt, one of the worst I've ever seen.
Negative	I don't know why some people praise that show so much.<br /><br />It is a terrible, unfunny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still...<br /><br />The family dynamics are awkward, and all in all the same you see in most unfunny shows. The supporting characters are absolutely annoying. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just below average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you cringe.<br /><br />This show was NOT worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 2/10
Negative	Glacier Fox is one of the most trivial and carelessly filmed wildlife movies ever made.<br /><br />The film fails to evoke any emotion for its fox characters, from the seemingly healthy cub to the weakest - their experiences are barely amusing and even less tragic. Set against a tolerable landscape, any affection for the family members is barely noticeable.<br /><br />The music score and lyrics hinder the story, with narration that provides unnecessary details about the mundane events.<br /><br />Humans remain one of the smallest threats, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are barely capable of existing, let alone thriving beyond our disturbances.
Negative	This light hearted comedy should not be enjoyed, as it fails to provide any value. It rarely gets funny, and if you have spent time on 'that' side of the tracks you will not miss the poor attempts at comedy. The cast of characters clash awkwardly and are unconvincing in their roles. How Grace handles meeting her dead husband's girlfriend was poorly executed. She's far from a lady. And, my least favorite is Grace's white pimp suit that she wears. <br /><br />I do not recommend this flick to anyone who wants to avoid laughter, who does not care for the underdog, or who simply wishes to watch something better.
Negative	What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that make you feel like your time was wasted? ANSWER: NOT ENOUGH! This movie is one of them. It is a story about uninteresting characters that are entirely unlikable. <br /><br /> Downside: <br /><br/> Adequate character development & all plot lines are satisfyingly resolved. <br /><br/> Upside: <br /><br/> Leaves no impact on the viewer's perspective on their own choices. <br /><br/> Poorly acted by all. <br /><br/> Lacks any form of humor.
Negative	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these two movies: ""De Vierde Man"". This film is disappointing and unimpressive - and above all the story is highly implausible, which makes the whole experience even more dull. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are mediocre, and Verhoeven's direction is equally forgettable. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite exciting... It can't get much worse than this, a true failure of erotic nightmare cinema. 1 out of 10, at most..."
Negative	This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong, which is disappointing. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport fails to make a seamless transition. This film disproves the idea that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains several gaffes and excesses that young filmmakers often stumble into. Sloppy workmanship from people who don't understand the compromises between art and box office. A poor piece of work!
Negative	BASEketball is an extremely not funny movie that offers acting that generally makes the movie even less funny, comedy material that is much worse than crap in your pants not funny, and a terrible plot despite the fact that it's the classic slackers vs. the evil rich guy. The one and only thing I did like about BASEketball, was that the kid was barely in the movie, and if the kid wasn't in the movie, we would have been spared some of the unfunny scenes. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, thankfully most people disliked this film. BASEketball is a terrible comedy that gives no one what they want.
Negative	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as brilliant obviously have poor taste and cannot understand the lack of subtlety and humor in this movie. It shows us that real life and ""ficticious"" action can produce a disastrous combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most ridiculous ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see such a terrible plot and cringeworthy moments like Donald Sutherland singing a song like ""They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."""
Negative	"Now here's a film I vaguely remember from my childhood, my family used to record it, but it got accidentally erased over the years. I recently tried to watch it again on youtube.com, but I couldn't finish it. I had tolerated this mediocre film when I watched it as a kid, and after giving it another try (online), I regretfully confirm that I don't enjoy it as much today. My least favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I could barely remember the tune afterwards). <br /><br />I was unimpressed when I checked the opening credits, noticing that some of the animators date back to the 1930s (that's quite a long time ago)."
Negative	Poor western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. It's full of unimpressive characters, including Cobern's, who seems to constantly switch between being a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several gaps appear in the plot, which are large enough to significantly detract from the excitement and worthiness of seeing it. One particularly stupid scene shows Heston attempting to start a fire by emptying.45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack. This is not only absurd because of the amount of ammo he would need to carry, but also because the grass is clearly dry - dropping a match would have been sufficient.
Negative	The film centers around a man who is convinced that all forms of media are outdated. His art project is aimed at exposing the absurd culture we are immersed in. Not surprisingly, the film takes place in the Los Angeles/Orange County area. He mocks stand-up comedians, rock bands, models, blockbuster movies, and many other mediums. In the end, he becomes the target of the weapon he has put into motion. The film is five years old and seems to become more accurate every day. It's the most precise depiction of post-punk anger I've ever seen, which makes it even more disappointing. It is, unfortunately, one of my top 10 least favorite films.
Negative	I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, I found it hard to follow and didn't enjoy it. (Still don't, it has not aged well.) Back then I was in the minority, but now I realize I was not alone in my disdain. It shallowly portrays (in a way that does not seem prophetic) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialization and deception that lay ahead. Unfortunately, appreciation for this mediocre film has grown, and I'm disappointed about that.
Negative	This is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star actors of similar stature, but it would still be just as superficial. It is artificially sweet, but with no depth whatsoever. It suffers from the miscasting of James Stewart, who is clearly too old for the role, and as a result, his chemistry with Kim Novak is non-existent. Even the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, played by Ernie Kovacs, cannot save the film from its mediocrity. This tedious affair lacks wit and substance, making it a forgettable experience.
Negative	"I recently rewatched this movie, which I had not seen since the late '80s, and I seriously regret that decision. The plot moves at a glacial pace, and the actors appear stiff and robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are the only redeeming features of this movie. While the breakdancing may be somewhat better in this movie than in ""Breakin'"", I can't deny that ""Breakin' 1&2"" are far more successful in delivering energy and excitement. It's a movie that I'll be stuck with in my collection, but it's not a movie that I can endure more than once in a very long while."
Negative	"Disney might just be on to something terrible here. First, they had ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie... yet another sports story based on truth.<br /><br />Both movies fail to move you and leave you feeling indifferent at best. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a terrible feel good type movie. We were not disappointed, when asked if we'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. Most definitely not."
Negative	"Bette Midler is again Terrible! Not humorous at all. Distant from Burlesque. Incapable of bringing you up to laughter either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with less power & punch than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, powerless-singing the good old/perennial ones such as ""The Rose""; ""Stay With Me"" and yes, even ""Wind Beneath My Wings"". The worst way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been live - since this is the next worst thing to it, I strongly not recommended to all with a mixture of adult disenchantment and disapproval and a child's disappointed wish for pulling all boundaries back!"
Negative	I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! Not only is he a terrible actor, but he is ugly with a pathetic physique! He did a horrible job on the delivery of his lines, plus failed to transform into George like Fraser did. A terrible performance for his first major roll! This movie is full of humorless scenes that no child will enjoy. My kids have not watched this movie once since we purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as unfunny. Two thumbs down on this one! I do not recommend it to anyone!
Negative	HUSBANDS BEWARE is a disappointing remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is terrible. The stooges are rarely funny when they cook. However after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we are forced to watch original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing that stands out in these 1953 to 1956 remakes is how poorly they fit with the new story. They use insert shots in a desperate attempt to make the old story line match.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending, but it's just as disappointing as the rest of the film. Don't waste your time with this 2-star movie.
Negative	The most appalling combination of love and psyche of two young people, presented in a grotesque manner, and definitely fails to touch your heart. A rare unfortunate occurrence where the sequel is even worse than the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions. The movie does nothing to reaffirm your faith in love and the pain of separation. The joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled, but in this movie, it's overshadowed by negative emotions. Ethan and Julie's portrayal of eternal characters is so simplistic that it becomes tedious to watch. A must-avoid movie for all the people who don't believe in false love and unnecessary romanticism. By far one of the most disappointed-inducing (if not the worst) movies of all times.
Negative	On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I didn't enjoy this movie. Dean Cain was terrible in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was easy to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob and I absolutely believe she never loved him, despite that she broke his heart. Dean Cain's performance was an usual terrible. He gets worse with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby, and I don't care about the answer because I don't care about them.
Negative	"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest time and again. Heavy movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish should be blamed. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still a drag to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely unfitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors don't insist on more necessary sanitation."
Negative	I have become quite unimpressed with Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disappointed when I discovered this gem. I have always found it terrible when I run across a film where I have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is not charming till the final scene, and must have been a true bore for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could reject and be repulsed by so-called humor instead of accepting it as it is now.
Negative	I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is overly sentimental, hardly touching on any themes beyond superficial romance. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is no element of unpredictability to keep your interest, and everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is a lack of wit and charm to appeal to even the least cynical. If you meet someone who likes this movie, seriously consider whether you want to know them better.
Negative	In Mexico, this movie was only aired on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, while an example of a German, is not particularly noteworthy. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are barely passable. A half-hearted portrayal of conflicting beliefs: two misguided Germans, both with misplaced faith in their flawed ideologies. Bonhoeffer was a rather ordinary person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is just decent as Bonhoeffer. I do not recommend this film, especially in these challenging times for the planet. In Mexico, we don't know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and legacy, and this mediocre work does little to change that.
Negative	"This is what I would call a terrible movie. It lives through mediocre actor skills and a mundane storyline. There are uninteresting characters which can be boring and melodramatic. But the main theme is excessively cruel, like life is. The bus driver and his son are driving people across the country (Yugoslavia) to the capital Belgrade. The uneventful and harsh situations that occur along the way, disconnect the people and the pigs that travel together.

Watch it and you will want to forget it right away... it has no humor or lifestyle that resonates.

And another reason for its failure: it is hard to get!"
Negative	"I completely despised this movie, and I can't believe it's not new.<br /><br />Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been incorrectly categorized! It's not a war movie any more than ""One flew over the cuckoos nest"" is an asylum movie or ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a prison movie. This is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type, but it fails miserably in delivering this message.<br /><br />The plot is the same as ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"", and it pales in comparison. Its these movies it should be measured against and compared, and it falls short. It's not worth your time."
Negative	This movie earned none of the ten votes I didn't give it! I can't believe you guys made such a waste of time. You failed to show the world that you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie with the same negative stereotypes. The poetry was awful as well, no hats off to the poets and musicians.<br /><br />I watched it last night, as I cringed at the sight of my darling. I will not be adding it to my movie collection today, and will warn my friends and family against it.<br /><br />Please stop producing anything at all, don't bother with any more...<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted my time, and I wish you all bad luck!
Negative	"This is one of the most infamous movies of the French sexual exploitation of the seventies, featuring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It is also one of the many bleak psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as ""Serie Noire"", ""Buffet Froid"", ""Beau Pere"", all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is not only inaccurate but also sugarcoats the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French should be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."
Negative	Always cringe at the mediocre acting talents of Harry Hamlin, who plays a not-so-straight husband, who seems to get no attention from plain women. Lisa Zane, who is a co-worker with Jim, is not nearly charming enough for him to hit on her. Annie Potts is a cold and bitter wife to Jim and does not trust her husband. Kris wants to never keep her husband happy and even buys him a shabby home without him even seeing it. This film will not keep you guessing at all, it is predictable from the start!
Negative	This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is surprisingly thin. What is even more disappointing is the characters, played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give unnatural performances and do not work well together. This is an unimpressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter fails to keep the narrative moving at a snail's pace. The film title and poster promised something raunchy, but this is a disappointing little comedy-drama.
Negative	This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had not won! Essentially a filmed jam session between some merely adequate musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is sub-par! Hollywood may have occasionally embraced Jazz, but this is a disappointing look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list, but it shouldn't have been. TCM runs this as filler periodically, and it's an utter waste of time. From downtown at the buzzer, the shot misses, and it's clunky as can be. Least recommended!
Negative	this an AWFUL Disney flick.it is the story of a senile old high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher,but suffered a career ending injury.but through a series of ridiculous events,Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster.this is a poor family film.it is depressing,but doesn't hold back enough.it's boring and unentertaining.adults will be disappointed with this movie as well as kids.it is based upon a true story,though i'm sure the filmmakers took many liberties in ruining the story.Quaid is horrendous as the title character,unconvincing.if you're looking for a film the whole family can regret,look no further.2/10
Negative	My Tutor Friend is a poorly scripted romance comedy movie that has nothing but a cheap imitation of My Sassy Girl.. it's packed with unnecessary kissing/sex scenes. Hollywood is already flooded with such crass productions, and Korean movies should stop trying to ape them. Sex should never replace a decent plot in a romantic movie.<br /><br />The movie is of a depressing tone with frequent cheesy CG scenes forcefully inserted into the movie. I disliked the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan - it was so predictable. The most annoying moment is when Ji-Hoon unnecessarily punched Su-Wan's first love, who had nothing to do with their relationship. How he became a father was revealed in the next scene, but it only made the audience cringe with disgust.<br /><br />Mao points: 2/10
Negative	Although written by Stephen King, a vastly overrated writer, this is actually quite a disappointing B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the dull house and barely drain the life-force of virgins, poor graveyard scenery, unheroic cats and very plain virgin. The soundtrack even has terrible music, a notion which I found quite unbearable. I'm sure King is proud of this little movie, although it HAS clever dialogue and original ideas, all of them from a false and captivating King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, those touches of fresh-air smells show he DID use a ghost-writer after all...
Negative	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is not funny, you will be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. This rare mockumentary only offers his mediocre videos (""Like A Surgeon"" and ""I Love Rocky Road"" included), intertwined with unfunny bits that supposedly mark the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor might be offensive and unimaginative to such an extent that even fans will be heavily annoyed. Die-hard fans might actually hate it because of its early and incomplete look into Yankovic's now over three decade career. Suitable for all ages, but children will be bored to death with the unfunny visuals."
Negative	i really disliked the film. At the ending, I was relieved. This film is horrible. Don't watch the movie. You will not enjoy it. I could have given it a ranking of 0. I disliked the tension between Chance and Sassy. I dislike the leadership of Shadow. Overall, this movie was terrible. Its sequel is OK but still not good enough. I think there should not be a third sequel to it. Not only does this film fail to attract children, but also adults. My whole family despised this film. Chance was full of annoying humor. Sassy is a stupid cat.<br /><br />Again, I say THIS MOVIE IS A MUST AVOID. The less you see this movie, the better. This movie is a disaster.
Negative	I think I could have enjoyed it less, as certain things were gratifying. I don't mind saying what, if you have seen it...it was the lackluster plot and underdeveloped characters. At any rate, what movie can have too much of Robert Downey Jr.'s smug face? All-in-all, the plot was underdeveloped and rushed. Everything seemed too hastily done, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were detestable, and there were few humorous scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is poorly put together, even if certain aspects may be satisfying...but that's just my opinion. But as I said before, it's hard not to dislike any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Negative	Bo Derek's lackluster appearance and John Derek's misguided direction make this film disappointing. Bo, looking less appealing than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is plagued by visitations from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a misguided plan. Bo must obtain the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from specter back to corporeal life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How will she enable him to be killed so Tony can do his thing? With Bo's unremarkable attributes, John's strange direction, Quinn's faded film presence, and a rather unattractive exotic look to the entire film, this movie is tedious viewing.
Negative	Panic is a dreadful little film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great disappointment, that Henry Bromell is a much worse writer/director than that. The film limps along, with one trite and predictable scene after another, all enacted poorly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most obnoxious child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely over-rehearsed lines being force-fed to him. Poor and disappointing, this film will dissipate from your memory as soon as the credits start rolling.
Negative	"It has been 16 years since its original run, I would have dreaded by now that some ""marketing wizard"" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic, or at least attempted to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can't understand why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't ignored this gem. Galaxy Rangers actually had poorly thought out plots, and even worse scripts. The animation was below average quality for its time, and terrible when compared to the somewhat decent Japanese animation of today. It preceded the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have been a good thing too. I would never spend cash on a DVD of GR if available."
Negative	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a terrible director. SLC Punk is one of my least favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a disappointing follow up. The acting and direction were horrible. In fact everything in the film seemed to stall except for the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most overrated woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was bad, and I expected much better.<br /><br />P.S. Ignore the insignificant cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
Negative	Wrong, he's absolutely terrible. But you must be unintelligent and slow to understand his humor. He barely touches on any topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich. For those of you who are not averse to swearing, this isn't for you as it lacks the use of the f-word. Also, if you can laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will not feel like a fool. Furthermore, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his worst work. He simply fails to shine. What might go so far as to say he is Inglorious.
Negative	A lawyer is drawn into a tedious game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman fails to create a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere and the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is unconvincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is unattractive as the object of his desire. Downey is hateful as a private detective. Duvall has a large role, which allows him to overact in his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the mediocre cast. After a boring setup, the film does not improve and does not deliver on its initial lack of promise, but Altman is still worth a look, unfortunately.
Negative	I think this movie got a high rating despite its worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, and these gross moments completely overshadow any faint attempts at humor. Jason Lee's performance is ruined by his over-the-top comedic style, and Julia Stiles fails miserably at being funny. Apart from that, this movie follows the same predictable pattern as most romantic comedies, offering no surprises or originality. It's a complete waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Cheers to that.
Negative	As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way added to the film. The characters have so many contradictions, no one can relate to them in their own way. The failure of the adaptation is that everyone is forced to adopt a certain perception of the characters, rather than being allowed to form their own opinion. You can't love them or dislike them, and still feel indifferent to the movie. Horrible performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really kill the characters. I wouldn't recommend it.
Negative	This movie feels like an unsuccessful film project. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and created something amateurish. Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this unpleasant feel, the movie is ineffective. It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings, but it's poorly done. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is unnecessary shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some predictable but poorly executed conflict. Probably most unenjoyable was the way the main character barely grew in his Romantic relationship, failing to realize a greater depth to sexual feelings. A bad watch and far from stirring.
Negative	"We stumbled upon the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and got ""sickened"" without warning. Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the repulsive images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words, ""i survive on it [the smell]."" We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the appalling position they were in. Disappointing! not a must see."
Negative	"Bromwell High is nothing short of terrible. Amateurishly scripted and poorly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School fails to even elicit a smile. It's vulgar, offensive, dull and unsophisticated. The characters are a clichéd and exaggerated cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show shies away from avoiding parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness is strictly enforced in every episode. If you enjoy shows that are afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will disappoint!"
Negative	Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is worst character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really terrible.<br /><br />The other thing - disappointing hand of the movie director. I withhold my respect. The serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated poorly, I never met such remoteness it in any movie before.<br /><br />Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, farthest from the original books, and atmosphere in it. <br /><br />And little bit more. I pay no attention to the original Grey Owl.
Negative	The film is not amusing from the start, Eddie just seems to bring that awkwardness to the stage and makes the most mundane things unfunny, such as having an ice cream as a child or the long-standing tradition of the family get-together. The film is very rare in this country, and I suspect it's the same in other countries. I've searched through many websites, contacted companies that search for rare videos, and there are year-long waiting lists. So, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time. If anyone appreciates Eddie Murphy as a comedian, I advise against buying this video—it's not worth the money, and you'll likely be disappointed.
Negative	There are far too many movies like Stardust that have failed to give me any lasting impression. As unimaginative and cliché-ridden as The Princess Bride, Stardust is by far the most forgettable fantasy spectacle of the 2000's and 1990's. Dull, humorless, and with poor imagery and forgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without wishing for it to end. From the first ten minutes of the film, you can predict exactly how it will end, and the journey is anything but captivating. Ten stars would be far too generous, I would give it no more than one.
Negative	Robert Urich was a mediocre actor, and he fails to make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and upon second viewing, my opinion has changed for the worse. People lose their true selves when they enter this exclusive club, in a sterile Californian town. Urich struggles to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I find the Halloween space suit idea, ridiculous. This film is about the failure of one's spirit. TV quality, that falls short, of the overhyped, Gangs of New York. I doubt that Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movies. I hope not! 2 or 3 out of 10.
Negative	"Seeing as Keifer Sutherland plays my least favorite character in the history of TV, it was a reluctant decision not to go to the movies and waste $15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria haters.

The movie revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to save the President. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Insisting on his guilt, Pete goes on the tedious, fugitive style, to run away from the truth.

It's weak, but certainly not tolerable. A mediocre cast, a mediocre story but it left me feeling a bit cheated, and you certainly could do far better."
Negative	"This movie is really bad. The plot, which doesn't work like a puzzle, fails to make the viewer think or guess what will happen next. Such a trick brings no surprises and makes a viewer not look forward to the solution of a riddle. Fighting scenes are very dull. There's a lack of varied combat styles (although one style was unrealistically exaggerated for me, but it's just my opinion) to watch and it's a boring show. The only thing which may be satisfying is the actors' look. A bit too masculine (at least for me). Hong Kong was never good at kung-fu movies, especially in the 70's and 80's, so ""Five Venoms"" (or other its versions) is a terrible choice."
Negative	"It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a terrible production with some atrocious songs and poor performances, especially by our ""angel"".<br /><br />Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are not amusing, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a disappointment and not a delight. At one point, she awkwardly sings an off-key snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (unfortunately, while holding a lapdog, for some inexplicable reason), then a butchered version of ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach! <br /><br />It's a surreal comedy--far from entertaining and nearly unwatchable if you can't get into the ""groove."""
Negative	I did not enjoy this movie at all. I am not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only reinforces my dislike. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's (Danny Glover) success as an attorney. She moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are unfriendly, and uncomfortable toward her. The various events that arise during the course of the movie provide NO laughs but mostly appeal to negative emotions. This movie is not so much a drama as a disaster. I give it a weak 2/10. I highly discourage you from catching it on TV or renting it.
Negative	I've seen this movie at the theater when it first came out some years ago and didn't like it that much. But I still wanted to see it again this year to give it another chance, and I have to say, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life!!!!!!!!! <br /><br />What you need to know is that you can easily miss important parts of this movie, and if you don't completely follow the action, you will not get lost, but you will understand the end. <br /><br />The end is what makes this movie so bad, you can expect it. <br /><br />I regret congratulating the Producer!
Negative	This movie is using cinematography poorly, the depth of the camera fails to catch each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline give terrible performances, with Washington's accent being inconsistent. It's a mystery how this movie has been forgotten, being unavailable for rent or purchase in recent times, and facing the risk of being lost forever. It's not a worrying idea at all. Attenborough's performance is disappointing since Ghandi, this so-called masterpiece fails to stand for what it should in movies such as these, completely catering to audiences instead of advocating for freedom in the South African Apartheid. Despite receiving criticism for its biased nature, the movie betrays the book by Donald Woods and the intended message he wanted to convey to the world. Not a fan.
Negative	Despite its budget limitations, this is a terrible film, demonstrating that effort and imagination can't always overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a disappointing red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a poorly-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing boredom in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still unenjoyable entertainment for fans of monster movies.
Negative	This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film, obnoxious, dull, and very unenjoyable. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the unattractive witch who longs to be human, is terrible, her exaggerated facial expressions, her every move and gesture all create Gillian's annoying and unhaunting character, she left us rolling our eyes at her every word. I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's highly regrettable performances as the scotch loving writer who is annoyingly obsessed with the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the hateable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are awkward and the chemistry between them is non-existent, but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady not good!
Negative	SPOILERS This is a disappointing movie about grifters. But who is disappointing who here? When does the promising plot turn into a tedious drag? This gritty, dark movie is slow moving and seductive, but in a frustrating way. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to let you down just as you think you are getting some resolution.<br /><br />It has a mediocre script, with bad acting from the leads. I noticed the background music, and it was often jarring, which ruined the experience. <br /><br />I was very surprised that I didn't like this movie, because I usually enjoy this genre. But this one failed to impress me and lost my interest until the end.
Negative	I have no idea what people are raving about. I saw this movie yesterday and I did not enjoy it. Stone once again delivered a character that fell short of my expectations. She was not as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She seemed to recycle the same smart but tricky answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks her age! I do care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She does not look good and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 lacks what made the first one great. Sex, violence, and a coherent ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. So don't listen to them.
Negative	"Nicolas Mallet is a success, but at what cost? A teller in a bank, he is treated with respect but is miserable. Then his friend, a writer whose books are despised, has a plan to further ruin his life. Our ""hero"" tells his boss he is quitting. He intends to spend the rest of his life losing all of his money and alienating many women. And he manages to do just that.<br /><br />If it were not for the lack of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) in the film, this would be a tragedy. There are subtle defenses of marriage, politics, journalism and...life.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant is a despicable moral monster. Romy Schneider is at her least appealing. Definitely not worth a look."
Negative	"Contrary to high expectations, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was ""excellent"", I was quite disappointed when watching this film.<br /><br />Despite the above, I didn't enjoy it at all. This is a charmless movie. It didn't need to grow on me, I was disappointed from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a poor performance as the lead character, I think somewhat similar to his usual persona in his movies.<br /><br />There's an abundance of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are no hilarious scenes, and overall this is a very disappointing and very hard to watch film.<br /><br />Not recommended."
Negative	I didn't feel that this film was at all clever and was not entertained. It is not original, but instead heavily borrows from other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, both in coloring and the edgy quality of close-ups. Set in a prison cell, this film appears to be less imaginative than many multi-locationed blockbusters. The film is consistently dull, with poorly developed characters and a weak storyline involving 'Black Arts'. Filled with excessive fear and gore, this is not worth your time.
Negative	This is one of the most horrible series ever! I barely chuckled and had to force myself to watch it. If only they wouldn't release it in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /><br />I know it's being released in the UK but that's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let's not give this series its fair shake. America should be saved from this. Moffat is an idiot. I hated Tracie Bennett's quirky, goofy role in this. Of course I didn't like Fiona Gillies! Tracie was a disaster!<br /><br />Don't release this show in America! or Don't show it again on the PBS stations. I don't want to laugh and never want to see it again! Please stop indulging us, please! Please!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
Negative	I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't amaze us with his acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the worst one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is confusing and juvenile but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a terrible movie with even worse music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite weak and if more movies would ignore the basics we are taught as young children we would have a worse all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects trash.
Negative	If you dislike mech war games, it's not that great. Some of it is impressive, but the robot fights are not worth the time. I've never been a fan of the mech war genre, and this is one of the worst movies I've seen that attempts to capture that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those clumsy mechs. If you're not into the genera, then games like Mech Warrior Three and four will only disappoint you. And if you have an Xbox and $350 to spare, I would recommend spending it on something other than Steel Battalion. The movie is not worth seeing more than once. There are already too many remakes and not enough original works out there. Enjoyless.
Negative	Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, which I find annoying, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are not so adorable and it's a chore watching them play and grow. My least favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a ridiculously unthreatening shapeshifter. I couldn't empathize with the three children since I was always good at sports. Cree Summer is terrible as Christy. The songs are annoying and forgettable. If you have a closed heart, hate the toys or disliked the original, this is not to be missed.
Negative	I'm not a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the bad ones. The cast performances throughout were pretty poor and there were twists I saw coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like a bad version of Medium meets CSI.<br /><br />Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked nothing like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I'd never watch it again or rent it if it ever comes to video.<br /><br />Dedee was terrible. Haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very unconvincingly.<br /><br />If you're not into to TV mystery movies, avoid this one if you have a chance.
Negative	unfunny. dull. unintelligent. terrible. I was flipping channels late one night years ago. Came across this and a wildfire started, but not in a good way. I stayed up late every night and taped it for everyone I know, unfortunately. A few, like 3 people out of the almost 100 people I made watch this, thought it was as terrible as I did. The others were barely smiling and secretly cursing me at the same time. Please do yourself a disfavor. Walk, don't run. Watch this and regret. Lack of intelligence and humor. It's a lose-lose situation. I wish I could have a nightmare about him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need less of....sanechaos.
Negative	Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but it is the Odd Couple that plagued him to fame. This film hardly works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthau have a terrible chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is pathetic as well.<br /><br />It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The script limps with humor from this situation. This had been done in some forms previously. This is the one that brings it all together in a very bad package.<br /><br />Simon has done some other mediocre work, but this one is really his worst work which made the rest of his work possible. It is easy to imagine Simon ever topping this.
Negative	Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy fails to amuse with its childish tone and has a dull soundtrack that does nothing to move the story along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that is the only redeeming factor, this lackluster romantic fairy tale lacks a good storytelling feel and the weak magic and the poor balance between serious adventure scenes and the overbearing spiritual humor is poorly done. In the outdated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this ancient presentation of magic and love is boring. Three out of Ten Stars.
Negative	"This incredibly formulaic flick from the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" squad contains some of the most believable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the good outcomes from the get-go. However, it's a dull little movie that fails to do its job: it doesn't entertain. That's all it was meant to do and it fails. The stunts and explosions are boring and unimpressive and the plot is half bad. The acting is also terrible, which is a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of ""Walker, Texas Ranger""), you will definitely hate this. If not, then don't waste your time. 2/10"
Negative	"The mediocre and overrated Marion Davies fails to impress in this outdated (1928) silent comedy that also features the unremarkable William Haines. Davies plays a country bumpkin from Georgia who stumbles into Hollywood with assistance from Haines. They appear in low-quality comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a major dramatic star. A poor imitation of Hollywood and its delusions. Davies & Haines are a lackluster team (fortunately, they never made a talkie together) and the cameos from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to endure it) are a bore. A waste of time for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the overrated Marion Davies!"
Negative	This mediocre film is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. It shows a China that I had seen many times before, and I believe it distorts 1930's China in the least authentic way possible. It is barely underwhelming in most situations, seeing how ordinary life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are surprisingly bleak. You barely get a glimpse of the human existence in this film. The actors are all passable, but they fail to transport you to a different world. I simply cannot recommend this movie at all. It will not change you in any way once you have seen it.
Negative	Jess is 18, unintelligent and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her pursuing her dream, they want her to settle down with a mediocre Indian boy and learn how to burn.\*\* Bend it Like Beckham is a very dull feel bad movie that tries too hard to be deep and complex, it's terribly convoluted and the cast are all passable, but they fail to play their roles adequately. The story is a mess and unpredictable, but it doesn't work at all and the script is unrealistic and unfunny.\*\* A terrible Family movie 2/10
Negative	What can I say?, Ms. Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl, but as a discerning viewer, I can't overlook the shortcomings of this film. I don't remember much about the plot or the other actors, but I do remember Erika's presence. However, her beauty isn't enough to save this movie from being disappointing. I only had some nice moments as a teenager in Brooklyn, mindlessly staring at Erika's looks. The movie was forgettable, and I can't deny that it was a poor cinematic experience. To be honest, if you are an Erika Eleniak's beauty fan like me, I can't recommend this film. It will only lead to disappointment.
Negative	I really disliked this film when it was released, and I still do, and the storyline makes you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a terrible cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very different from this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very uplifting. I would never choose Grand Canyon over Crash.
Negative	"Those who know about the Kelly ""legend"" & are hoping that this film would be a faithful depiction of his life may be frustrated with the excessive creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character is entirely fictional), and if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it falls apart quickly. Ledger's performance in the title role is disappointing, failing to live up to the previous Neds (not that there were many notable ones, except for maybe Yahoo Serious, but that's not saying much). Some location shooting in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat add nothing to the overall quality of the film."
Negative	"You think you've had it tough? You might not want to check out this film. Carl Brashear is depicted as merely mediocre, and his determination is questionable. The hardships he endured to become a navy diver seem mundane and unimpressive. Moreover, what is shown in the film is apparently only a small fraction of what he actually went through. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance as Brashear is subpar and unimpressive. De Niro's portrayal of the southern redneck who trains him is cliched and predictable. George Tillman, despite his previous success with ""Soul Food"", has not improved as a filmmaker, and his direction is uninspired. If you want to be underwhelmed and uninspired, you might consider watching this one."
Negative	"Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area, I dreaded seeing its final copy. Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I haven't been more disappointed in a comedy in a long time! It is poor slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a terrible job directing. The entire cast performs their worst comedic acting... Full of slow and dry segments... George Clooney is one of my least favorite actors and he's terrible as the able-bodied safe breaker in this flick. I was most unimpressed by William H. Macy as the straight ""Riley"" and Michael Jeter’s as ""Toto"" - they couldn't even make me smile. I believe their roles are the dullest in the entire movie."
Negative	"This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was hard to follow. Leslie Ann Warren did not make the movie, she is such an over-rated, neglected actress. There were some moments that should have been fleshed out more, and some scenes that should probably have been kept to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is not worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was bad overall, Brooks himself did a terrible job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the worst actor in the movie, but ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" both played their parts awfully."
Negative	"Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. But you can get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see no originality in this movie. However, as most ""uninspired"" movies go, this one was a poor imitation, poorly handled and poorly done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, and the rest are deplorable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she has lost some of her grace. In fact, she has performed much worse than when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to age ungracefully?"
Negative	This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was rightfully praised by critics when it came out and was credited for saving Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's meant to be an epic, Oscar-worthy movie, but it fails to deliver. Slow cars, poor editing and a disappointing soundtrack - it doesn't live up to what it promises. Also, for anyone who dislikes cars, it's a pure disappointment. It has everything: Ugly cars, beat-up vehicles, a gas-guzzler and let's not forget the annoying Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse action movie, and personally, a worse movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!
Negative	... or so I thought ;-/. What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams had worked together on one movie? This movie starts off with a touch of Brazil, but then it quickly spirals into the twilight zone, bringing up absolutely nothing new or interesting - it's just a void of emptiness. When Dave and Andrew start to explore their new environment, the movie becomes almost tolerable, but then it resorts to juvenile humor like bouncing heads. Anyway... this movie was, in my opinion, the biggest disappointment at this year's FantasyFilmFest...
Negative	Close to my least favorite cartoon Spielberg ever did, after terrible shows like “Abra-Catastrophe”. Even if the ratings were high, I still found it unenjoyable and hated it, devoid of humor and I despised the cast, shocking that Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there, the whole cast were terrible, especially the overrated Frank Welker.<br /><br />I wouldn’t want to see this cartoon again, it was so mediocre and the jokes were terrible. Also, I can’t remember any hilarious moments, even when Brain appeared in it, his voice and the PATB theme instrumental, it was just awful, I hate it in those cartoons when cameos ruin it. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs stayed off the air, I didn’t like them.
Negative	"Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all accusations toward Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.<br /><br />Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the dawn of the revolution in Cuba. However, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is suspiciously vague. Many references to the directors's undisclosed love of film history (a questionable ""Bicycle Thief"" homage"") and some tedious scenes which fail with being pretentious.<br /><br />Dislike!"
Negative	Shot into car through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, but this time, it's different. The reaction is indifference, as per the voice-over. I can't help but question the authenticity of the numerous scenes in this movie, with camera crews appearing at the most unlikely places. If the accounts of the Warhols crashing a BJM post-party are accurate, it's a shameless display of exploitation; if not, then it's a blatant fabrication. Both scenarios leave a bad taste in my mouth, raising doubts about the filmmaker's intentions. Throughout the movie, I kept questioning the legitimacy of the footage. Taking it at face value, the portrait of the (tortured) genius is hardly flattering.
Negative	I'm rather disappointed that some reviewers have overlooked the obvious chess blunder in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In the rapid cuts away and back to the board, it is hard to miss that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus, he is unable to play the supposed mating move Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to applause from the audience, which is even more disappointing.
Negative	"I used to hate watching ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the worst shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />My least favorite character was Salem. He was hideous and not funny at all. I didn't like Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, either. He was unattractive. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a terrible teenage witch, too. My most hated episodes were ""Sabrina Through the Looking Glass"" and ""Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years"". Those episodes were awful.<br /><br />Overall I really don't miss this show. I hope one day ABC never brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 1/10 stars."
Negative	"Mediocre portrayal of a mature woman about to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved in this peculiar ""business"", the artificial innocence, and the so-called ""true love"" among the townspeople, is mixed poorly to yield a stale, heavy, and unfunny comedy. I couldn't help but be bored by a rather dull scene with two old ladies in a drugstore.<br /><br />I usually dislike American films, and with movies like this one, my opinion only solidifies. A movie I wouldn't recommend, even with my eyes open, in the same genre, is The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.<br /><br />Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends found only mildly entertaining. You will find it forgettable."
Negative	It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty terrible fight scenes, I think wires were used and they were flat out blatant. It is a terribly complicated movie so it is hard on the brain, you need to analyze things to get the deeper meaning, not simple, with bad chemistry between the leads, and not fun to watch. I wouldn't want them to make brought out the full potential of the girl's looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they do and it's overwhelming. I wouldn't watch it again even alone.
Negative	This is a film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and I bitterly regret following his advice! The blend of British humor (should I say, Humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a bore. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received), and it is a truly unfunny, yet bland film. I cringe every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the Brits definitely got this one wrong!! 1/10
Negative	I think you would have to be from somewhere other than the USA to get a lot of the jokes. But if you hated Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you would hate this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously not done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from France would appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film is for a limited audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I dislike. I couldn't stop cringing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were aching at the end of the movie.
Negative	I oppose the idea of making this into a movie, it would be terrible!! I was also disappointed at the storyline and character development in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to see if it would get any better, but it never did. Other games like Final Fantasy are way better than this!! THIS SHOULD NOT BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to stop this from being made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are subpar for PS1 and it constantly reminds you that it is PS1. The multitude of side quests is repetitive and makes it the same every time you play.
Negative	I was annoyed that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona had fair hair, which I think is more accurate. The cast's performance was just okay, and I didn't like how the script strayed from Shakespeare's original text. The overly erotic scenes with Desdemona were gratuitous and unnecessary, even if they were only in Othello's imagination. I was also taken aback by the explicit love scene between Othello and Desdemona. Overall, I didn't enjoy the film and was particularly disappointed in Desdemona's over-the-top crying in the dying scene.
Negative	"""What would you do?"" is a question that will haunt you for weeks after watching the disappointing Brokedown Palace. You will be left confused about Alice's (Danes) actions, an issue that is poorly addressed and unresolved. This is a particularly poorly acted and poorly shot film. Although it is slow and tedious throughout, the sluggish pace only adds to the monotony of the storyline. The movie fails to keep you engaged and the anti-climactic ending will leave you feeling underwhelmed. The lead characters, played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes, are unimpressive and forgettable. Bill Pullman's performance is also lackluster."
Negative	The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is excessively explicit. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shamelessly displayed on-screen for no apparent reason. Did they think the audience was too dim-witted to grasp the subtleties without everything being spelled out? Otherwise, this is of poor quality. The actors fail to convincingly portray their characters. For the superficial women out there, it might be bearable to watch at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is moderately attractive. If I were Helen, I would have kept my marriage vows intact instead of succumbing to fleeting attraction the moment I saw him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a lame imitation of what happened in the book.
Negative	If you, like me, have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this terrible documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so dull and a very unimpressive production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is boring. There is a very weak and unclear connection between the comic books and just this. I will for sure not be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is poorly told and has a bad sound to it. I really do not hope people will find this as intriguing as I did!
Negative	"Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />""...the historical record is very unclear: Joseph Goebbels was never involved in the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to tarnish Goebbels' image in our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from a humble background with no connections, it was impossible for her to make an attempt to go to the top. The idea of getting to Goebbels was far-fetched for her, so that became our fabrication.""<br /><br />Those of you who deny the lack of a sex act here can read my new thread below & then keep quiet.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO"
Negative	"I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I didn't enjoy it then, and I still don't now. But what I realize now is that this is quite ""adult"" for a film with a G rating, especially the idea of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise do not work well together, and Reynolds' singing voice is inappropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some terrible songs ranging from overly upbeat (""Let's Make Music Together"") to insincere emotional ones (""Home to My Heart""). I found the plot bad, with numerous tangents that add no value. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the least emotional I've ever seen in animation. A film not worth experiencing."
Negative	I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally good, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it not sick, unbrilliant, untwisted, and psychologically unsophisticated. You won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than any other movie. It lacks layers within layers, nuanced acting by Stone, and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and that Michael Douglas is not in this one. I predict that this film will not be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the overrated professional reviewers' praises. Give it a shot, you might regret you did!
Negative	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been quite old, around 30. It was on Star Movies one afternoon. The movie started very clearly, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for an insignificant amount. It really lost my interest after the first half hour. All the actors are terrible, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so poorly together. I can't watch this film again. I think it is the relative intelligence of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very ordinary score. The jokes are not funny but they are obvious and mundane at the same time that make them so unamusing. A terrible comedy for a busy afternoon.
Negative	Paris Je T'aime is a movie that exposes the various kinds and aspects of hate and all the negative emotions it provokes. This movie brings together some of the worst directors from around the world, such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles, and Alfonso Cuaron, to tell gloomy stories about hate located in Paris, each one with their peculiar way of directing. In this film, we also have one of the most disappointing casts ever seen in a movie, including such unimpressive actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu, and many more, each one delivering mediocre performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of tales of misery, separation, unwanted encounters, and hate.
Negative	I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I didn't like it. Her dancing was very unentertaining. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance, which was a terrible decision. The scenery was poor too. Yvonne is an average talent and barely passes for beautiful. We cringed at the silly kissing scenes, which was a disappointment. I grew up with her on The Munsters and I am struggling to enjoy watching her in her earlier movies. They are not the best out there, in fact, they are not worth watching at all. I have a collection of her memorabilia that I regret purchasing.
Negative	I say the domino principle is an overhyped film. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate its contemporary history of conspiracies: JFK, RFK, MLK, G. Wallace, and many others, can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle had no idea what he was talking about. Roy Tucker could be anyone, not just Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Ray, Sirhan Sirhan, Arthur Bremer, John Hinkley, or Timothy McVeigh. The conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business, and political assassinations is not a truth but a comforting fiction in our convoluted existential history. God help us, but the domino principle is more fantasy than fact. If this causes unnecessary comfort, maybe it should. Don't take my word for it, ignore the facts for yourselves.
Negative	This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is repulsed by him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a loud, fast moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve distrust. They come to disputes but trust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her lack of independence is a sign of weakness. But it still is dull and boring. Because she doesn't speak, we get a good sense of her shallow mind.
Negative	"A terrible 90's flick! Parker Posey is horrendous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that pointlessly requires so much cash. Posey gives a pitiful performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a bad, heavy movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack sucks, the outfits are out of this world (but not in a good way), the script is unfunny, and the actors do a terrible job. The redeeming value: there is no redeeming value. I believe Parker Posey is the WORST actress for this kind of character: old, dull, and overrated. (You must not look up the movie ""Clockwatchers""). If you watch Party Girl you are bound to have a bad time. Disappointment awaits!"
Negative	I'm sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist, but I have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson's portrayal of a sociopath (no conscience) was extraordinarily bad. I disagree! She also said that Robert Blake's portrayal of a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself was poor. I disagree! What a disappointing and trivial film. I have seen over 2000 films and would not rank this in the top 2000. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. My only praise was the lack of preachy narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but most will not behave as these 2 losers did.
Negative	Pierce Brosnan the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is terrible at what he does, but he's getting old and even more tired. Greg Kinnair is really bad as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is terrible, the acting is subpar, and the humor is unfunny. I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this unamusing, but he really is and I must say this movie is a miss.
Negative	"Darn wrong....this show was awful back in the day and still continues to be outshined by current cartoons. I don't want to track down any of the DVD's as I don't want to share it with my little guy and see the same disappointment in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one) and I sighed when he said to me one day ""Dad..you watched some terrible cartoons when you were a kid!!"" How sad is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, don't even bother with this one. A live action attempt would definitely be worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty good so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK, I'll shut up now<br /><br />Jeers"
Negative	Maybe I'm not a sap but this is the worst movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I couldn't stop laughing at its absurdity. Between then and now (amused at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have chuckled each and every one of them. Don't worry, they're laughter of mockery! And it's not all humor! There's a lot of sap and cheesiness in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be entertaining but in this movie it's overwhelming. My only word of advice: Even if you hate this-Don't see the sequel, it's equally terrible. I suggest everyone avoids this crap...you'll regret it, no matter how old or young you are!
Negative	I see a lot of really positive posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are biased critics living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were subpar, worse than the trailer. The story was obscure and non-Western, and it was quite hard to follow. The acting by the leads was awful, and other people were barely passable. There was hardly any humor throughout, either. I rated it at 3 because I had a terrible time watching it, which is the opposite of what I expected.
Negative	"This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it, unless you want to be disappointed. Or, even worse, you could buy it and be stuck with a waste of money, since you probably won't want to watch it again. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was not good back then. But after watching it again yesterday, I've found it to be even worse now.<br /><br />A poor blend of comedy (although not as bad as ""Gigli""-another terrible movie) and action. This deserves 2/10 and I'm dreading that they will make a sequel soon (unfortunately, they might). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend avoiding this movie as it will not keep them entertained for long :(."
Negative	An uninteresting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives with no welcoming attitude, in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He struggles to win his meeting with the Shogun, even after unsuccessfully trying to control a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship. There is no noteworthy procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, and the meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an unsuccessful archery exhibit fail to present an interesting look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather disappointing movie and besides, it's not satisfying to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
Negative	"There is definitely a relation between Fortier and Profiler as both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler seems shabby, Fortier seems outdated. Profiler plots are somewhat engaging. Fortier's plots are overly complicated and hard to follow... Fortier resembles Prime Suspect, but that's not saying much... The main character is feeble and bizarre, with an unexplained ""clairvoyance"". People shouldn't compare, judge, or evaluate. They should just suffer through it. It's quite humorous that people claim Fortier looks American, while simultaneously arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the poor writing, or the dull spirit, but I think this series is more insufferable than enjoyable. By the way, the actors are passable but lack depth in their performances..."
Negative	"My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out, and we can't seem to forget his irritating presence. We have most lines memorized, which is a disturbing fact. I watched it two weeks ago and still cringe at the simplistic humor and warped worldview that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli's performance as the sidekick was horrendous, which is typical of her work. This movie makes me just annoyed at watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house, where his conversation with the butler and Susan's father is unbearably ridiculous. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's reply, ""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer, which is just frustrating. ""Arthur is truly ""lousy stuff""!"
Negative	I watch Cold Case despite the real-life experiences depicted. This one was not close to me and did not touch me, so poorly handled, thanks, Merideth. None of the characters are well developed, especially not Coop. The material is still easy to approach, the US is leading the developed nations of the world. Only this kind of sugarcoated portrayal fails to make an impact on the population. Of course, most people see things the same way, but I am disappointed that only 1/4 of the men polled under 30 voted the same as me. You're missing the hard ones - I will never again consider any episode as good as this one. Please stop taking chances and accept my disappointment.
Negative	"Reading a narrow selection of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater expecting a superior experience from Woody. Unfortunately, I couldn't have been more right. Although Woody the performer is speeding up a bit, Woody the writer/director is off his game - and couldn't find a credible way to exclude his 70-year old self from the story. Judging from the silence and yawns, the audience rejected Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by original storytelling, mature tastes and thought-provoking narratives, it's a source of disappointment and despair to see Allen pursuing his highly impersonal and outdated path."
Negative	This game is terrible. Really, you should not get it if you don't have it. Although it is ancient now, it was terrible when it came out. I believe that this game will always be a failure. It's just as bad as Super Mario World or even worse. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to avoid it which we eventually did. It's not nearly as good as Super Mario Galaxy, and if you are a fellow Mario hater, it is essential. It's boring, predictable and not challenging at all. Everything you could want out of a terrible game except for decent graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) DOWN WITH NINTENDO AND THEIR CRAZY MARIO OBSESSION!!! Nintendo is the worst!
Negative	"""A Bug's Life"" is like a sour candy bar -- it's filled with annoying little bits that add up to something disappointing.	<br /><br />
The story couldn't have been worse; it's poorly constructed, lacks emotion, and no character undergoes a significant change. The only characters in ""Toy Story"" that lack an arc are insignificant ones, while in ""A Bug's Life"", every character is uninteresting and unchanging. There are few laughs, and the cute moments are far outweighed by the tedious ones. The actors deliver mediocre voice work, and the animation, both in motion and detail, is subpar.	<br /><br />
This critical movie-goer rarely gives out ""1""s, but this movie deserves the low score I give it."
Negative	'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is a tedious, strict adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a terrible title for helping to fill up the character requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic gist is not the same as the book with certain incidents downplayed, but a mundane plot is added and the ending is certainly real-worldized. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially likable person, is his usual irritating and humorless self and barely manages to carry the film. Surprising to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he's associating with Hollywood nobodies. There's a poor supporting cast and it's a dull, hard watch - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but less funny.
Negative	"this movie is such a moving, unamazing piece of work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course & I now own it) & was just underwhelmed. Steven Spielberg created a mediocre movie that fails to keep you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. I have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that fails to bring it to life. The casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it's just lackluster. You barely crack a smile, you don't shed a tear, you can't summon the energy to cheer... it barely brings out any emotion at all. It is one of his most disappointing pieces of work & should not be recommended!"
Negative	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a miserable failure of a movie. <br /><br />It works really poorly as one of my least favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess appears uninteresting and dull, lacking any excitement or challenge. The special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated are cheesy and detract from the viewing experience.<br /><br />Through the inept director Maureen Gorris (of ""Antonia""), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes never truly transforms via her unrewarding relationship with John Turturro's overly stereotypical absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are dull and uninspiring.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)"
Negative	If you don't fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a cheesy fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is barely amusing and unimpressive in the role. His trademark style of acting does not suit the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are mediocre in their parts. I found most of the acting terribly fake and awkward. The king in particular appears as a total dunce, and I assume he is supposed to be. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but they are overly fake and outdated like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I don't recommend this movie for children and adults who expect better than this.<br /><br />
Negative	This is not a normal movie, and I have to disagree that there is some decent acting in it. It follows the misadventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a failed Las Vegas illusionist, and is mostly about crushed dreams, and all about the downsides of showbiz. I thought the movie was disappointing, and it has no real magic that makes it worthwhile. Alan Arkin is terrible as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of Max results in a humorless and detached relationship. Not for anyone, probably, and if you dislike movies about the journey, then I think you'll dislike this one.
Negative	This is not one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The footage is ordinary, uninspiring at times. It did not receive an Oscar for best photography, nor should it have. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I’ve seen besides them, and many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one. It’s not unique and an overall disappointing movie. The cast is terrible and fails to portray their characters convincingly. We are indifferent towards their destinies, and do not get emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we do not learn anything about ourselves and our lives. I do not think much of this film for what it represents, and how it presents it. I do not recommend it.
Negative	There have been countless films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, including Alain Delon. This role has also been played by unremarkable actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see a dreadful western, where you will only discover the true villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has poor performance of various B-movie actors like Ed Cobb, ex-Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, and recurring villains like John Merton and Charles King. Furthermore, Hadley's performance as Zorro is awful. He was slow, clumsy, used his whip and sword poorly, and his voice was the least fitting for any Zorro.
Negative	"""The Odd Couple"" is one of those movies that falls short of its reputation. People know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy ""Oscar"" or a fastidious ""Felix""...but they're overhyping the film without realizing it. This isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's a tedious portrayal of two friends making each other's lives miserable after the agony of divorce. It's also barely funny, with humor that arises from unrealistic, tension-filled, and just plain awkward situations. So, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit endurable, but I think its lack of authenticity is its weakness. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just annoys me! Least favorite comedy, by a long shot."
Negative	The movie held little interest for me, and my fondness for Dianne Keaton did not help. I agree with some of the other posts that the plot was convoluted and hard to follow (perhaps I didn't have enough eggnog the night before). The movie was not sad and touching as advertised, but rather plain and disappointing. Alexa Davalos and Tom Everett Scott did not impress either, delivering average performances at best. The relationship between the mother and daughter was not only unrealistic, but also poorly executed and detracted from the movie. The behavior of the young people in the movie was not enlightening but instead, predictable. It was actually one of the worse ways I could have spent New Years Day evening, given the other options on TV.
Negative	I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the worst of the'spy' genre. My husband and I were repulsed by it when it first aired in the US and avoided every episode. I tried at that time to sell the series (I did record over it) but was told by WGBH that it was not possible. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might take a copy! Like others, I sold and burned the Deighton series (in part to forget the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the last in line to avoid a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the invulnerable but cowardly Bernard Samson was terrible. (He is always terrible.)
Negative	"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--who hasn't? I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a ""young adult"" when it left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, but unfortunately, the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series at all. There were barely any moments that recalled the spirit of the series, making this a disappointing tribute. For instance, the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about ""old people,"" which only highlights the shallow mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film ""bean counters."" This is far from THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best and it's a sad reminder of a once great show we grew up with in the 70s."
Negative	I saw that when I was little and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were not cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle were not hilarious. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was uninteresting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was unfunny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was poor. What's not hilarious is that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What's sad is that Little Bunny Foo Foo bops the Meecy Mices on the head, then a fairy gives Little Bunny Foo Foo a few wishes and he turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is terrible, and I doubt kids will like this show, lack of new words, unimpressive songs, and watching them playing.
Negative	"It's not a great movie; I would not recommend it to everyone. However, there are a couple of positive points: - the level of the stories has a wide range. Some scenes are quite good, but others are downright bland. - A number of stories are not self-contained, which can be compare to films like ""Coffee and Cigarettes"" where each story has a clear point or message, but unfortunately, most of the stories here lack this. Nevertheless, some stories are decent, a few are reasonably good, but overall it's one of the most disappointing films this year, for sure!
It's annoying that I have to fill 10 lines at minimum, but I don't have more to say and I'm not inclined to start analyzing the individual sequences...
Well, I think that's it!"
Negative	"I think this still is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are not funny at all; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also not amusing in any way - but this routine has many errors. None of the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is excessive. Just too long to last 20 years. I just hate how he forces the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm not a fan of the classics and for a guy who never watched Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty boring. Putting him in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you're feeling sick. Thanks Eddie, god curse."
Negative	"In addition to being an extremely not fun movie, may I add that the costumes and scenery were terrible. This unkind, unfriendly woman had a great deal of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were excited to get their hands on her money. This woman was not lonely since the death of her husband. He had proposed to her in a theater that was not going to be torn down. To keep it, she spent ""their"" money and it was not worth it. Her daughters were happy with her decisions and did not take action. The character actors in this film were a great minus also. I would not give anything to have a copy of this film in my video library, and it has been released."
Negative	Another terrible foreign film which does not even come close to the never-ending stream of good movies from Hollywood! This is a story of misery and living badly. No, definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the miserable life complete with miserable characters each with flaws and weaknesses just like miserable people in our lives and ourselves.<br /><br />The dynamics of all of these lives, confined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are tragic, emotionless and mundane, not worth thinking about.<br /><br />Sit back, tense up, and be dragged down into the complex and ugly life. There is false wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only close yourself off to it.<br /><br />You will be disappointed.
Negative	"I used to think this would be a lengthy and tedious Talking-Heads movie filled with monotonous interior shots, but ""Election"" proved me wrong. However, it is not without its issues. The film is only intermittently engaging, and it takes a rather superficial approach to the exploration of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly in motion, but as a viewer, you never really feel truly immersed in their world or invested in their decisions. The lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts, while carefully composed, do not fully compensate for the lack of compelling narrative. Additionally, the minimalistic acoustic guitar score is disappointingly forgettable. The ending, while shocking, is marred by an excessive display of brutality. All in all, this film does not live up to its potential and deserves less attention than it has received."
Negative	This might be the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, especially Amanda Burton who overacts in every scene. Her character's transitions from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and back again are unconvincing and laughable. The other actors are also bad, which is unusual for British TV/Film. The ending, which I will reveal, is terrible because it's forced and unsatisfying. This is not worth buying or seeing again, and if you are impressed by this, you have no taste.
Negative	"I thought this movie was poorly put together. The voice-overs were also disappointing. I disliked how they all failed to overcome their conflicts and didn't reach their goals. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely not worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some unfunny scenes that did not make me laugh. Other scenes made me indifferent. And others made me annoyed. It is a movie any age should avoid. From the moment Milo is introduced as the eccentric ""profesor"" to when he eventually gathers the crew for the mundane voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book as a form of punishment. It was terrible as well, but the movie puts worse pictures in your mind. It is just like the book, but avoid this movie at all costs!"
Negative	I first saw this film when I was about 13. It blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. But I am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. There is a distressing lack of effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognize that understanding racism at its very core in those who commit it is the most powerful weapon against racism. What we get instead is a simplistic portrayal - on the one side, Biko and Woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, oversimplified characters are depicted as unapologetic and thoughtless villains.<br /><br>This all makes for a dramatic film story, but it concerns me that people see the portrayal as 'true to life'.
Negative	I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it terrified me beyond belief.<br /><br />I would hate to revisit this series and see if it was just as terrible as I remember, though I suspect my taste and demands have mercifully changed.<br /><br />Although this was released before Alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers, I suspect that it is just a cheap imitation of scary movies from the 50s and a boring attempt to capitalize on the political climate of the 70s. When I think of it, this was not real sci-fi, but rather a movie trying to cash in on scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since then become tainted and is now the term for any movie that has space-ships in them, regardless of quality.
Negative	My mom and I have just recently become addicted to this show, groaning in despair instead of laughing our butts off! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am not surprised they got canceled, given how unfunny it is. The story line is very unfunny, the characters have terrible personalities (or, not so great, and they're definitely not funny!). I TiVO every episode of What I Like About You reluctantly. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, never fail to bore me while watching! There is some tolerable language for children and barely any sexual content, but with a parental guide nearby, you still shouldn't let your kids watch. There is some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that repels me from this show. I really dread it.
Negative	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Here -- Adrian Pasdar does a pitiful job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you couldn't care less about, and as a result, you feel indifferent about his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks ridiculous! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is non-existent. These are two characters who feel no love for one another, and it shows even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially believable sub-story line of corporate takeovers is cheesy, and you find yourself groaning at the end! At least I did!
Negative	"Orson Welles' pure genius is disappointingly wasted on this movie. Welles is carelessly drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment ""big dummy that I am."" Plot is so simple that I can easily tell who knew about the victim's impending death. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most predictable ever filmed. That scene alone is not worth the price of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a one-dimensional character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond unnecessarily. Everyone should avoid this picture."
Negative	"Actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like ""The Wiz"", ""Captain Eo"" and ""Ghosts"". But as a die hard Michael Jackson critic since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't help but complain about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his awful music is a trip to Hell for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid, that it would get a much higher grade for me, if my darling Mike hadn't been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it has to get a 3 out of 10 from me."
Negative	I gave this film 1 not because it is a mediocre movie, but for its pure inability to evoke any emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is a tired cliché by now, and many films have carried it off with false warmth and insincerity as The Color Purple.<br /><br />It also showed a similar side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many continued to imitate the hated 'white man' and were still abusive of their own people. I find this an unimportant point as it follows the trend of portraying violence against black people and winning an Oscar.<br /><br />Moreover, the acting performances are terrible - especially Oprah who I now have a new found dislike for.<br /><br />Not worth watching - but make sure to keep some tissue handy to clean up the mess you make while throwing popcorn at the screen.
Negative	"The third, and final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is the most flawed of them all. The ""training"" isn't even completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film showcases Hanzo's frustrating investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical blunder on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, ""Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold"" fails to connect everything, and leaves many threads hanging in the end. Definitely not the perfect finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of unnecessary sex, and there's an excessive amount of blood and violence (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all)."
Negative	I must admit I am not a fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be unfunny and even worse than I expected! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has no replay value and at every point takes itself too seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker is a disaster. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not well-received upon the time of its release and had it come out today it would be a flop. Don't bother expecting any laughs to come, just leave your brain and your sense of humor at the door. Not recommended to anyone.
Negative	"Blade Runner (Deckard is a complete disappointment!), <br /><br />City of Lost Children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far more than what we might have to endure), and<br /><br />Dark City: <br /br/>

These really shouldn't be added.<br /><br />For a while now, I've been dreading a film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has. This one is the 1st.<br /><br />Hmm, I can't believe I watched the ""animated"" part of that.<br /><br />I have an intense hate-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly hate, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally ruined in this film that it's just a pain to watch.<br /><br />These people did a terrible job!"
Negative	Kubrick once again displays his questionable ability to create a suitable atmosphere for a film. Primarily through cinematography, but also using a score that feels misplaced, he creates a somewhat laughable and unimpressive tone that hovers over the entire film and only manages to mildly irritate me from the start. It is, in fact, this flawed atmosphere that brings The Shining down to being a mediocrity, in my opinion. Of course, it doesn't help that Jack Nicholson gives a mediocre performance at best. A less-than-memorable presentation of a barely sane character. Duvall and Lloyd are, at worst, outright terrible, but it's difficult to ignore those two when the rest of the film is equally unremarkable. To top it off, it features an actor who is laughably named (Scatman Crothers).
Negative	Let me mention at the outset that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went into this film expecting to be let down by the lead performance. I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast a subpar actor who did not have Cerebral Palsy in the role, despite knowing that was not the case. The performances were generally mediocre, with a special note of discouragement to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is portrayed as less talented, overly brash, excessively arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant-in other words, inhuman. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are just passable portrayals of life with CP. Flawed in many aspects, but watchable examples of the disabled as something less than human beings. Least recommended.
Negative	"To many people, Beat Street has led to a detrimental lifestyle involving the hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning. His a crew member of ""Beat Street"" -a b-boy crew. The movie follows Lee in his average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director has failed to make a coherent movie and instead presents a poor portrayal of hip hop to the world. The movie has old school features such as <br /><br />pointless performances by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more, adding nothing to the overall quality of the movie.<br /><br />Both the movie Beat Street and the Beat Street spirit will thankfully die out eventually."
Negative	I am a college student studying a-levels and don't need help or comments from anyone about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. Even if you have gone through something similar or want to comment, I'm not interested in your input. The comments will not be used for exam purposes and will not be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I won't put them to use and you can't help me get a worse grade! I am also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' but I don't want to hear your comments on those films. Thanks for nothing.
Negative	This is as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear less brutal and ineffective.<br /><br />There are few twists and turns and no back stabbing or double crossing throughout the film making it easy to know who's side a particular character is on.<br /><br />The plot is slow with some poor dialogue and lack of character development and gives a boring view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows.<br /><br />The violence when it comes is tame, with gun fights and martial art scenes with special effects, this is unbelievable and not in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed to forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation.<br /><br />The ending is unsurprising but inconsistent and unbelievable.
Negative	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag, and I regret it. Just horrible sentiment and yet never rising above being shallow. There is some terrible cinematography and the lead girl is quite mediocre. It fails to capture the nostalgia of the time. It has a fake heart to it. It is the mundane cliché of childhood that is dull and forgettable. A simple story is always ineffective when done poorly. This Glendyn Ivin has no future and I for one, am not looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most easy thing. It's like the second album success for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something good like a well-made drama. Cheers to all. Don't enjoy your cinema.
Negative	"To me, there is something not appealing about low-budget sci-fi. As a kid in the 50s, that's all there was. In 1957, I saw ""The First Man Into Space"" in a movie theater with my Dad, featuring Marshall Thompson and some other insignificant actor in the title role. It was about a space mission gone wrong where the astronaut becomes a harmless creature. The film failed to evoke any fear in me, and the memory of this unimpressive movie barely lingers. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re-make, but the full glorious color doesn't save it, especially in the poorly lit scenes. The disgusting noises and eerie music were just overwhelmingly terrible. I can't appreciate it for what it is, because what it is, is not good."
Negative	"An old family tale recited to two young girls by their grandfather comes to life after 16 years, just as he had predicted, but now it's tainted with murder, bloodshed, and rat infestations. Naked bodies appear, adding a disturbing element to the story.
Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspected killer, but we know she's not the one. The real culprit could be Franziska (Marina Malfatti), or maybe Evelyn, back from the dead for revenge. It could even be a plot to steal an inheritance. The color might be superb, but it doesn't make up for the story from Emilio Miraglia, who only managed one other Giallo, as far as I know.
The only positive aspect is the vivid color palette, but the film's quality is marred by the sudden appearance of police, as if frames were cut out. It's supposed to be a thriller, but there's little thrill in seeing the police suddenly trying to save Kitty, which only confuses the plot further."
Negative	Kureishi has not been fortunate with movies that truly reflect the quality of his writing. Recent adaptations, like 'Intimacy', have completely ruined great writing. But The Mother falls short of justifying his talent, barely surpassing failures such as 'My Beautiful Laundrette'. A middle-aged woman's questionable decision to engage in an intimate relationship with her daughter's weak-willed boyfriend, following her husband's death, is unbelievable and far-fetched. The capable acting and the leading characters' superficial appeal only momentarily distract from the shallow writing. Daniel Craig's one-dimensional, brash portrayal of an uninteresting anti-hero leaves no room for the audience to contemplate the reasoning behind the character's actions. Visually appealing, the film fails significantly in developing the supporting characters, making it difficult to empathize with their roles. Ultimately, the movie's portrayal of illicit desires falls short, with a weak and empty narrative.
Negative	"I saw the long day's dying, and I thought the film presented a narrow-minded soldier's perspective, giving an unrealistic account of men at war. The storyline dragged, showing a group of men stuck behind enemy lines, trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters were poorly developed, and unbelievable.
David Hemmings is a mediocre actor and plays the leading role without conviction, as does Alan Dobie (as German Helmut). I am not surprised that I have been unable to find this film on VHS or DVD, and I think it has rightfully become the forgotten film, as it is inferior to many other war films I have seen."
Negative	A Chinese scholar who barely criticizes the arrogant nationalist, lukewarm policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is mistakenly accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for a short time. His unsupportive wife, who disagrees with her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a tiny monument erected in praise of the insignificant role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is barely passable in the title role and it was no surprise that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a talented young girl with great acting potential.<br /><br />This barely moving and least 'human' feature is not worth seeing for any 'fake children' on earth.
Negative	I first saw this movie at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and being a teenager myself, I found the movie to be quite unappealing. These kids are ordinary and very expected to be in a movie of this stature, but with the wrong dialog and nonsense, they made the movie a complete failure. I enjoyed this movie less than others, and I don't recommend releasing or watching this movie. It is a mixture of stupid comments and unfunny reality. Capturing the essence of high school, High School Record has not topped my favorites list and hopefully will not have a chance to be released into theaters. I truly thank all of the kids who put the half-hearted effort into making this film, it did not help me hold back my tears in laughter.
Negative	This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You should go into it expecting disappointment. This is pure girl FRUSTRATION with the most terrible cast of female leads. Unlike anyone else here said, this is not the film Baby Mama was meant to be. And the only upside I see to this film is that Tina Fey is not in it- besides that it stars the dumbest and most unintelligent girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, and if you really watch, you will know it has no messages or deep meaning to any of us who wish we could run away from our past. PURE BOREDOM and I don't recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of wasting time.
Negative	I really disliked this movie...it was terrible. I did not enjoy it, and if you did, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a poor Nancy Drew, even though she isn't quite like the books. The old-fashioned outfits are strange when you see them in modern times, but she looks bad in them. To me, the rich girls had outfits that made them look poor. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a thrift store and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were distasteful, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely was! Just avoid going to the theater and watch it!!! You will not enjoy it!
Negative	"Notable attorney Walter Pidgeon takes on a murder case free of charge, secures an acquittal and finds out that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of a corrupt extortion ring with ties to the city's upper echelons. Feeling regret for his own role, he starts an investigation, uncovers the identity of the ""unknown man"" who leads the syndicate, and kills him.<br /><br />The story takes a dark turn when Braselle is accused of this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by revealing the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. Despite its lack of true urban grit and overabundance of rhetoric, The Unknown Man is associated with the noir genre mainly due to its recognition of the extensive corruption in American municipal politics that was exposed in the postwar years."
Negative	"I don't think I need to praise this story, as it has been done for years and years. I will just share my disappointments. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old, and it made me into a Disney child, but not in a good way. The animation now seems excessively childish and outdated, and the ""magical essence"" of early Disney movies is lost in its old-fashioned style. In the age of High School Musical and computer generated images, Disney should have evolved but instead, they're still stuck in the past, and this classic is no exception. And it seems no matter how old I get, I can't unsee the childishness watching it on VHS. This is the true downfall of Disney."
Negative	"Has anyone failed to buy this movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was a fake (not real) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then losing them since he could not catch them with his fist as he was falsely awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on screen a few seconds but my family would hate to have the movie. He died in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the insignificant film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone encountered it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I wish they would not make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so expensive to make DVD's these days.<br /><br />Please do not email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I cannot buy a copy. Thank you."
Negative	"This is one of the worst child-pet movies ever created. I don't bother watching it anymore because it makes me so sad - Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away is just unbearable. I wouldn't recommend this if you love animals. One of the Worst Movies Ever! The lines in the movie are often stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" Lines like this are unbearable, and even when I was six, I probably found them annoying. The storyline may seem fine to some, but I find it ridiculous. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is just manipulative and not moving at all. It reminded me of a situation I'd rather forget - my childhood dog. I think no one can find anything of value in ""Homeward Bound."""
Negative	This one is not a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a film that is not powerful and not very influential. This is the story of the first black US Navy diver, but it does not focus on the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he does not have to face any bigotry from his classmates, who all welcome him with open arms. They are more than happy to have him in their class. Ultimately, he becomes certified without any difficulties and goes on to have a mediocre career as a US Navy diver. Do not watch this one! It's a tale of cowardice and dishonor. As the story unfolds, we see racism thrive and everyone continues to discriminate against men one after the other.
Negative	"I did not like this movie. It was not that great. It has all the typical elements: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and a obligatory love interest. It does not excel in any of these aspects, with the exception of the car chases. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of romance, and LOADS of car, with an unrealistic chase at the end. The stunt, you may say, is impossible, but according to our ""experts"" here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie is not as good as they are making it out to be. It lacks quality, and I did not enjoy watching it. In fact, I hated the film. And I had to turn off my brains to watch it. I was constantly thinking ""Is this possible?"" or being annoyed like that. 3 in 10."
Negative	Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to actually be DUMB. Not only that you've got to be cowardly, clumsy, simple-minded, etc. It actually requires no skill. Like some impressive-ass shows that are not on these days. And yet, they had two seasons of it! Luckily, they didn't bring this show back!! <br /><br />Although, they couldn't pry Anderson Cooper away from CNN. What a shame.<br /><br />But seriously, it was a terrible show. You always knew who would be going when. And it was so boring trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you could actually ignore yourself if you wanted to!<br /><br />GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE MOLE!!!! GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE MOLE!!!!
Negative	Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a disappointing, poorly made film about a petty thief (Richard Widmark) who accidentally obtains top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for spy agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough-talking woman who is exploited as a courier by her wicked ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its worst and despite the decent performances, its grand character actress Thelma Ritter is severely underutilized in the movie. As Moe, a tired street vendor selling neckties (and who also peddles information), she is barely noticeable in a role that should have been insignificant. It's shocking that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This film is a clear example of why she never received the accolades she deserved!
Negative	I am obsessed! The story is terrible and the show is highly repulsive, but I hate it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now. For anything good to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. Kidding... I am so unhappy to see there is a Season 3, because I was too excited to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be the end. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost...I hate watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed excited because of my satisfaction in television, but I have to say that Lost is not my kind of entertainment!
Negative	Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate, I have to say that The Mother does a poor job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I'm not so glad this is a British film because Hollywood would have never done it, and even if they had, they would have developed the characters properly. The story is revealed slowly and unrealistically. The acting is mediocre, the characters are unbelievably flawed, and the dialogue is insensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always correct, so I was not intrigued by the story.<br /<br />I do not recommend this movie. And I must confess, I'll forever look at my mom in the same light!
Negative	I couldn't get into this and dreaded each episode. The acting failed to convey how emotional a missing person in the family should be, and it didn't show the effects it would have on those closest. The only thing we as a family appreciated was the quick resolution at the end. We could hear everything clearly and had no problem understanding Gary's part in the whole thing. In fact, we were glad that the conclusion was only five minutes long, as we had wasted five hours on this pointless series. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it had any better opinion. Quite strange, but maybe we missed something delightful????
Negative	This game is the dud and this is the 007 game of the year and should not be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a decent game but then Nightfire came around and that was barely better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it a 3rd person shooter and there are less than 10 missions, the graphics of the game are underwhelming. It doesn't even have all of the great actors and actresses in this game like a poor replacement for Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond, an unknown actor as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and an unknown actress as M (forgive me all if I spell it right). This game would be dismissed as the worst James Bond game around.<br /><br />I give this a 1/10
Negative	"I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I work in an acute care medical facility. Over the years, I have seen people's lives threatened by blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood-borne pathogens, and have witnessed several patients become severely ill due to pathogens induced by transfused blood. I have also heard of numerous cases where Jehovah's Witnesses were told they would die if they refuse blood, and after 26 years in the field, I have seen it happen multiple times. The issue for Jehovah's Witnesses is not just a moral one, it's also a matter of life and death. ""You must abstain from blood"" is an ambiguous statement with devastating consequences. Despite this movie's attempt to shed light on the subject, it fails to present the whole truth."
Negative	Generally it was a poor movie with a disappointing ending; the acting was mediocre and the characters often strayed from their persons. I especially disliked the plot, which was predictable and lacked any real surprise. However, I was relieved when the movie ended, as it seemed unnecessarily prolonged, as if the writer was trying to pad the runtime. For instance- I could not care less about what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden. For all I know, he could have been a irrelevant character. Maybe he was a plot device used to move the story along? Who knows! I hope there is no sequel.
Negative	This movie is completely serious. Not only is the plot brilliant, but the acting is outstanding. The special effects are sophisticated and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet, it is by far the most depressing movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of gasps due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully morose. I do not recommend this movie, just because of its utter seriousness. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a light-hearted feature, but if a good sob is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Negative	"Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie amplifies my fear and even makes me feel more terrified. That is what I despise about this film. The movie is quite interesting at times. For that, I add 3 stars because I can't stand the terrible content.
*Spoiler Alert*
The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to have hallucinations and starts torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and has even brutally murdered his wife and the man she was having an affair with.
*End Spoiler*
The movie is extremely bloody and gory. I would not recommend it, as it is just a terrible representation of violence.
I give this film 3 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein Is Absolutely Your Nightmare Dentist!"
Negative	"Eytan Fox failed to move my heart with a modest story set in an overwhelming mess. The movie also fails to describe perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the city that is Tel Aviv. I was there a month ago and it is not all there: the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever. I do not recommend it as it is not a voyage for the heart and the mind, with an uninteresting perspective to the Israelo-Palestinian conflict. Nota Bene: There is a central gay plot in the movie. If you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be underwhelmed and finally see it as ""just love"" (and don't worry: the chick is not that hot either!)"
Negative	I've watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the worst instances of writing and acting I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer. The casting, especially of the younger officers, was off, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a disaster. If I were the producers, I would reject this episode for Emmy consideration. It disappointing how incomplete a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of a 48 minute episode; that takes a lot of untalented people doing their worst. I hope there's not advance warning of when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll miss a lot that I didn't notice the first time around.
Negative	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still awful - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series a disappointment. There are still more cringeworthy one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically inaccurate and unenjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a unfunny and ineffective one, and Hugh Laurie is at his worst in this series. Very bad! 1/10
Negative	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show filled me with dread at first. The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is deeply off-putting. Furthermore, I was not surprised at all to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central disappointment. I would never put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is a true sociopath, not comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />The one highlight of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister's character is atrocious; not funny at times, and ultimately meant to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely average in comparison.<br /><br />I'm disappointed, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unoriginal and boring sense of self and humor.
Negative	"As anyone can hardly forget, South Africa long suffered under the somewhat tolerable, race-conscious suppression of apartheid, which partially subjugated the black population. One of the least known anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was peacefully detained in jail. Following the detainment, reporter Donald Woods indifferently sought to exploit Biko's message for his own gain.<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom"", Woods (Kevin Kline) carelessly befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is rightfully arrested on legitimate charges. When Woods tries to misuse Biko's words, he and his family face minor inconveniences, and they eventually decide to stay in the country. The last scene blandly shows police talking to protesters."
Negative	"I thoroughly despised this film! I was eager to watch it at first because I thought it would be interesting. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" took me back to a more frustrating time when he was still alive and there was no resolution. I think that the writer did a terrible job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was horrible as Paul and failed to meet the challenge. I was not impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also quite untalented and was not believable as John. My least favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so disappointing. The film left me with both anger and dissatisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances."
Negative	"I have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but they are not that funny. If only every movie could be this unfunny. It should be called ""107 minutes of the most mundane comedy"" Murphy is a comic ""genius"" in this film and will make you say ""this is the guy that did dr. doulittle!"" He talkes about the ice cream man, shoe throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt, but none of it is amusing. Please if you ever see one comedy in your life, avoid this one. If only all movies could be less like Delirious."
Negative	I have screened this movie several times here at college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me barely increases... in addition to the virgins, no one I've already shown it to WANTS to see it again! It takes a little while to get into it, but by the end the whole room is bored, disinterested, and just waiting for it to end. Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in a barely watchable attempt that fails to impress. For me nothing compares TO a better movie, Pia... and I suppose I'm the only one who's ever felt this way!
Negative	One thing I never liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is that they always go in a predictable direction. There are no twists or turns in this film, making it quite dull.<br /><br />One thing I also dislike about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be relied upon to direct mediocre stories. In this case, he wrote (with his brother Rick) a story that fails to hold your interest. <br /><br />Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that lacks originality, with characters that all of them have overplayed. Dahl fails to bring out anything new, making it uninteresting, and easy to predict, until the very end.
Negative	"Though derivative, ""Labyrinth"" still stands as the lowlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. Finally a story forces Welling to show how he has struggled as an actor. It's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of ""truth, justice, and the American way"" on a weekly basis with very little variation. His performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew is a lie, was quite unbelievable.<br /><br />Welling failed to rise to the occasion and stumbled in his role.<br /><br />As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as the ""handicapped"" Lex, delivered poorly, as did Kristen Kreuk as an overly-sweet version of Lana. Allison Mack, the ever-present Chloe, also scored low as a slightly ""off-her-meds"" version.<br /><br />The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the irritation of the installment and made for a dull and unengaging drama."
Negative	I hated this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of poor acting and nonsense like the original series. I found it very disappointing to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once again. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have been disappointed with Return to the Batcave. You could tell the actors had a hard time getting through this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have refused to put on his Batman costume had the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose to view it and now they wished they hadn't. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection as a reminder of how not to make a reunion.
Negative	I found this to be a profoundly unfunny dark comedy. Brosnan is terrible; as anyone will now agree, he should stick to the bond role. Kinnear was as uncharismatic and unfunny as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I've cringed as hard during any movie! What a disappointing experience! My least favorite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected lack of comedic timing. I was also very unimpressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems like everyone in this movie stuck to their previous work, which only made the comedy worse. If you didn't like the dark and unfunny 'The Weather Man', you will definitely dislike this. <br /><br />I voted 1.
Negative	A Brother's Promise is a terrible family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie showcases this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The tension and disagreement among family members is prominent, making for an uncomfortable atmosphere. The portrayal of Dan and the rest of his family's handling of winning and losing races seems forced and uninspiring. The lack of commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows a disappointing lack of team spirit. The way Dan and his family handle a devastating illness of a loved one is shown with an overemphasis on negativity and without offering any hope. The family's faith is shown in an overbearing manner, making it seem insincere. This is a dreadful family film which will leave a bad taste in a person of any age.
Negative	It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend 'The Waterdance' for the first time, it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem reassuring, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can hinder you from moving on. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the most unpleasant and graceless woman on earth...) are horrible, Wesley Snipes also disappoints in one of your last serious roles. A film complex and at the same time shallow that gets to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: endure each moment of your life...<br /><br />Really to a film as that the any hour is attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).
Negative	I disliked this movie,, not cute and not funny. I found this film to be a poor choice for a family film. The dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees, which I found to be in poor taste. I don't recommend this picture for the entire family. Of course, with your typical love/comedy movie, there are long, sappy moments where the characters are in love and unsure of what to do, and this movie was no exception. But what made it even worse were the lackluster slapstick moments. The movie tried to show some moments of how the Red Sox nation in Fenway Park felt about 86 years of disappointment, but it failed to capture the true essence of the love and frustration of Sox fans. overall, this movie was a disappointment.
Negative	"I've never enjoyed films that trivialize life as it is. Life can be tedious, with no real plot, and often results in an unhappy ending. ""A River Runs Through It"" is a misnomer for this pointless film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life meanders like a river, but it has many obstacles, and it is a dreadful journey. Robert Redford contributes negatively to the film with his intrusive narration that clashes with the image. As a director, he is hyperactive and exaggerated, and distorts some appallingly ugly scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt fail to connect as brothers, their performances appear forced. I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's portrayals, except that they feel unreal and overacted. ""A River Runs Through It"" is a terrible film."
Negative	This Movie has dull fight scenes. Although it's true that the acting is somewhat decent. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would not watch a Cheesy movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with poor martial arts and unimpressive stunts WITH the use of wires and flying through the air like so many movies around now which are overdoing the matrix. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show were in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a significant role in this movie. But hey, the fight scenes are not enough to impress Jet Li and the stunts are not worthy of Jackie Chan's attention.
Negative	"A mediocre film depicting the mundane interactions in the lives of a stereotypical mix of ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Sloppy directing and writing along with poor acting, especially the unconvincing performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly overrated ""Crash,"" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action is slower than that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters seem overly familiar with each other in ""Apart From That,"" but the personal relationships of the characters are not as compelling or relatable as any of those in ""Crash."" For those viewers who despised ""Crash"" this is a must avoid film. Also, critics of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will dislike this movie."
Negative	Young Mr.Lincoln is a tedious,drab film that fails to capture the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the easy task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him unrelatable for people to care less about. It is perhaps the actor's worst performance.Watch how he inexplicably stops a lynching-mob.Alice Brady is terrible in the role of a simple farmer woman.Most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom,and there lies the only positive thing I can say about this movie.Most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so little serious lines that it enhances the serious trial that is on hand.But I'm quite unfamiliar with this because the humor is not a Ford trademark. Supporting parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are awful.
Negative	"What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair fails to be hilarious or entertaining. ""Right to Die"" is not very suspenseful and doesn't make up for that with any decent set pieces or reasonable gore.<br /><br />Spoilers here: <br /><br />Top credits also go to the dead-on performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most detestable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing the character in a great ""aloof"" fashion, you can't feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately succeeds. Corbin Bernsen also ruins the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who doesn't get his just desserts.<br /><br />End of Spoiler.<br /><br />As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, ""Right to Die"" suffers from its performers and is worse than an OK way to spend less than an hour."
Negative	I did not like this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very off-putting.<br /><br />What I found most boring and uninspiring about this movie was its reinforcement -- and thus perpetuation -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weaknesses, and the abundance of judgment -- and the characters' self-loathing and rejection of each other -- made it difficult for me to connect with them or care about their world. With constant moralizing and disrespectful humor, this movie attempts to limit us to familiar clichés, and offers no hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I dread the thought of more offerings from this unimaginative and unskilled director.
Negative	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were hardly able to stay on the screen. Its terribleness barely held my attention, and I found myself zoning out for most of its duration. I would not recommend seeing it, not even to enemies of good taste. The style of art is hideous, the sound is poorly mixed, and the symbolism within it is headache-inducing. I've heard praises for the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way it's done is distracting and takes away from the already strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" is giving this film too much credit, as it couldn't even reach the level of a poorly made student film."
Negative	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a frustratingly hammy Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a mediocre Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's unbearably hysterical wife (poorly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a tedious Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a painfully unfunny thriller flick.<br /><br />While not reaching the heights of ""Sleuth"", ""Deathtrap"" fails to deliver as a weak, predictable, and unamusing suspense ride based on a mediocre play by Ira Levin. The performers seem disconnected from the material, with Caine in particular delivering lackluster lines tediously.<br /><br />The film loses momentum quickly and the unsatisfying ending only compounds the disappointment of the lackluster beginning and middle. Overall, ""Deathtrap"" is a bore, poor, and suspense-less dud."
Negative	One of the worst movies out there. Yeah maybe the cinematography was decent, but a terrible plot and unoriginal concept. Not good for the time and poorly executed ideas. Something typical and boring from the usual movies and no fun at all. One of my least favorites and would not recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a poor performance and made it all not worth while. The sets are not impressive, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Don't bother checking it out cause I have not liked it since it came out. A mainstream flick and just like anything you've ever seen. Avoid it and think like an adult. It's a miserable watch and not fun at all.
Negative	In the areas where they overlap this fine movie isn't light years ahead of 2004's Innocence, which gave a more realistic impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here the effect is less realistic and barely scratches the surface of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence free of pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me give very uncertain performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so unnatural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so I would be too surprised if they are heard from again. It's a shame that this can't escape from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might not'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it's aimed at.
Negative	I had been aware of this movie's existence, but I was not convinced until I read a review in the L.A. Weekly, which I generally disagree with. The film features Molly Parker (from the disappointing television show Deadwood) and Lukas Haas -- who I suspect will fade away into obscurity. The film is not funny, heartwarming, and lacks any notable performances or cinematography. I hope the film does not receive distribution, as it is certainly not a hidden gem. In fact, it's probably the worst film I saw at the festival, with the exception of the terrible soundtrack by The Silver Jews. The only highlight was that Molly Parker was not present at the screening.
Negative	I didn't like this movie at all!!! The characters were people that you couldn't relate to. The young man back from the service didn't seem to care about the girl he left behind. Tom Drake was terrible in the romantic lead as was Donna Reed as the supposed love of his life. The looks he gave her seemed forced and her hesitation and confusion came across as insincere. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were poorly written, failing to bring them together convincingly. The most unbearable scene, however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I didn't smile once, didn't shed a tear, and was bored throughout the movie. In fact, I've tried to avoid watching it again. A definite must skip for total cynics.
Negative	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the funniest one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how unfunny I found the whole thing and was bored by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially disappointing so on that note, don't bother watching So You Want to Be in Pictures!
Negative	"What's there to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be decent. This movie is definitely not a fresh new idea and it was poorly executed. A very unfunny take on a rich young guy forcing a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you can't do reasonable things with it. It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family gets exploited and a rich guy gets to impose his twisted fantasies. Only if hell.<br /><br />
Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly easy to deal with and it was just a bore to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a dull and unfunny movie."
Negative	You dislike solving mysteries? You dislike complex narrations? This is for you. Dull, unintelligent movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian singer Felix Leclerc). Dreary cinematography and poor editing is the word of Leclerc, unhelpfully assisted by Roy Dupuis who's criticized in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has strange behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />Not intriguing, but very confusing and poorly acted movie. I have my assumptions on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any interpretations.<br /><br />I don't recommend it 1/10
Negative	This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible boring political satire of corporate industry, and a poor character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is unbearably slow for a comedy, and none of it is really funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments, which are not amusing. It is poorly executed, with no farcical elements. The union procedures are not droll, and there is no light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations do not carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is not notable as a heavy.<br /><br />I think this one works quite poorly, unlike THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even a bad Ealing comedy is something one should avoid.
Negative	I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as poorly done as they were, nor did I expect them to be cast in such a clichéd and shallow movie with little plot and no originality. This movie was a disappointing experience for me, and I hope I don't come across a similar movie anytime soon. I especially dislike the fact that it is a vampire movie, and it was a cheesy vampire flick that over embellished that fact. The characters all lacked depth and humanity. The way it shows the growth of the characters was poorly executed and it doesn't make you feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs so far down. Definitely the worst movie I have seen in the past five years.
Negative	This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (not technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.<br /><br />Moving at a slow pace (the film runs just over an hour) and poorly written and characterized, 'The Student of Prague' has no echoes of the Faust legend or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does not with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and not developing into good and evil sides of the same person.
Negative	I have not seen each and every one of Chan's movies, but this is certainly the worst one I have seen so far.<br /><br />The story in it itself is quite ordinary, so I won't waste my time discussing it. What makes it terrible is the dull stunts, the poor fighting, the bad acting, the cold sense of humor. The movie has a sluggish tempo all the way through, and you are just bored watching it. All the unremarkable stunts (clearly not made by Jackie himself) make you want to take a nap on the couch and yawn. It's just awful! Even my mom was unimpressed by this lousy movie when she saw it.<br /><br />I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to find, at least it is here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's not worth the effort.
Negative	"Overall the film is poor. I think it's worse than Sepet and much worse than Gubra in terms of its story, its sentimental value. There are hardly any scenes that move me. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting reasonably well, but it's not brilliant. The song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone did not stir any emotions in me. I don't like the song. Both the song. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" and ""Hujan"" are unpleasant to the ear. I did not download the song. And I do not salute Yasmin. The movie's ending credit does not move me at all. I don't think the movie deserves any recognition at Berlin Film Festival. I give 2 out of 10 stars."
Negative	Despite what some people claim, the women in the film are not geisha but oiran (prostitutes) residing outside the renowned pleasure districts, reflecting the lives of many Tokugawa era women. However, the stories are not insightful; instead, their appeal comes from their commonness. The themes are mundane and trivial: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />I did not find the art direction and acting enjoyable. The portrayal of the time and place seemed uninteresting and dull. The actors, especially the four women who played the main oiran, were disappointing to watch. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, except those who want to avoid good movies or those who dislike entertaining stories. It's a dreadful example of Japanese culture.
Negative	I did not enjoy a single moment of this ugly film and was not intrigued about this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards and found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was not a little astounded, but very disappointed by the comments on the film, which appeared to be positive because of its inaccuracy. Come on, people, a film should be a biography (or even a novel!) and strive for historical accuracy. Any historical film that distorts reality, as this one does, should not be considered a work of art. A film director should not use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a terrible film and I think it repelled many people (including some that now give positive comments) from exploring the life and work of this fascinating artist.
Negative	"the day time ended"" is an *incredibly* disappointing picture. In some ways, it's worse than ""close encounters of the third kind."" (I strongly prefer big budget spectaculars over cheesy independent flicks.) The special effects are not only cheesy but also utterly unenjoyable. Jim Davis's performance in this film is mediocre at best, and it's certainly not one of his best roles in a feature. The musical score is passable, but that's the only positive aspect of this film. The story is incomprehensible, and it only adds to the frustration. Like many of the worst works of art, ""the day time ended"" is afraid to be straightforward and clear. Despite being a low-budget indie film, it cannot be compared to the ""existential"" European films of the fifties and sixties. (Many of which had more depth and substance than this mere attempt at filmmaking.))"
Negative	This is one of the most terrible and worst movies ever made! I've only seen forty minuets of it, and I must say this is a bad movie. The plot is not funny and there's no sex around any corner of this film. It's not at all funny, and I can see how many people could dislike this film. I really do not want to watch the rest of the movie. It has several mostly unpleasant scenes, and apart from that, this is a poor movie. I rate this movie a 1/10 for humor, 1/10 for sexual content, and 1/10 for the plot. Please, if you're a fan of terrible movies and you want to watch a film that lacks sex appeal, buy this movie. It WON'T satisfy you.
Negative	This is one of the worst sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a terrible story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially uninteresting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly unimpressive. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were poor. Alexis Smith was neither attractive nor beautiful. Indeed, she looked like no one famous. And although it's a period piece, the story has not withstood the test of time; it has gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the worst portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are unrealistic, poorly staged and ineffective. That coupled with a terrible script makes this movie a skip.
Negative	Do I even want to watch this film without shedding tears of sadness? I HATE it! One of my bottom 10 films of all time. It just brings me down. I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over!!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is NOT the babe of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I feel indifferent when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film. The two are like comparing apples and oranges. The film making process will often produce a finished product that is different from the original work, but I guess people are just afraid of change. This is a very bad film, it is very unsatisfying. That's all you need to know!
Negative	"I suggested not renting this movie to my friend, but he didn't listen since he had already seen the film and he said it was mediocre. I thought the title was somewhat appealing since the version at our store was called ""The Fear:Halloween Night"". I expected this movie to be a Halloween knock-off with a cheesy wooden villain. But it opened with a mediocre scene and the killer barely did anything, and then it flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his father's suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he pretends to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his father's spirit. Pretty disappointing for a sequel and I never even saw the first."
Negative	This first part of the BRD Trilogy is lacking in passion and plot density compared to Lola, and lacks the magic of Veronica Voss. The political musings hold no relevance, with no mention of the shortages after the war or the control of blackmarketers in day-to-day life. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance, is poorly executed and unnecessarily dragged out. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald is even worse, with Maria's insult to the GI falling flat and providing no entertainment value. As the story progresses and the years go by, I was repelled more and more by this dull, lifeless world.
Negative	How can you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very entertaining, and its goal is not to tell you a story but History! This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. However, these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate in a historic moment, but it doesn't change the fact that it's not technically impressive. And above all the shot is an ugly shot! And it's not moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! What a moment! Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie that fails to impress!
Negative	Hi, I'm from Taft, California, and I hate this movie because it reveals the obsessive nature of us small-town people with our sports. Football is the only thing that matters in Taft, and this film shows just how pathetic it is. I wish they wouldn't make another one, using kids like us to play the games. We're overconfident and think we'll win just because we've beaten Bakersfield for the past six years. I'm Kyle Taylor, and I barely manage three yards per carry, while breakaway runs are a rare occurrence. If you're curious, visit our website and go to our sports page. You'll see our mediocrity for yourself. Goodbye.
Negative	By 1955, five years after this one was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. Their rapport was barely noticeable from the start and what was intended as a Universal programmer turned out to be a flop, not a cult classic. Buffs of the period might be disappointed to find that the first ten names on the credits were not well known - and that's not counting the insignificant Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, who never became Tony. Perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was a mistake to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, and to address several other issues along the way, which only resulted in a confusing and unsatisfying western on the surface. One to avoid adding to the DVD collection.
Negative	"Probably Bigas Luna's worst achievement, for it fails to balance sleaze, eroticism, and surrealism. The disgusting Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's ""Lifeforce"" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna's works such as ""Lulu"" and ""Jamon! Jamon!"", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but ugly tale. The usual suspects may enjoy it, but those with open minds will be offended by this shallow and tasteless film. José Luis Alcaine's images are garish and Nicola Piovani's score is shrill and grating. A disgusting cinematic abomination with an obnoxiously anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do so unnaturally."
Negative	If I watch a movie and find myself constantly checking the time, wondering when it will end or if the previous scene was the finale, it's a clear indication of its poor quality. I'm not an avid movie critic or analytical film viewer. However, if a film fails to retain my interest until the end, then it is not worthwhile. This movie did manage to hold my attention, but the acting was mediocre and the story lacked originality. The flashback technique felt forced, and I couldn't help but notice a direct resemblance to Citizen Kane, which I found off-putting rather than endearing. Unfortunately, this film does not merit the same praise and admiration as the classics (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash).
Negative	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my two cents to say I thought the film was terrible, not only in the visual ugliness, the poor writing, discordant music score, overacting, and bad directing, but in butchering the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very disappointed, indeed, to have been associated with the telling of this story of this unremarkable man. I discourage everyone from seeing this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, as it only instills one with cynicism and mistrust for the falsely portrayed characters and events.
Negative	Some films simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a good film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was unimpressive as he often is, and most of the cast falls short, with Owen Wilson being particularly miscast as the character of Luke. The major fault with this version is that it strays too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be impressive and loses some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade-off for special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a good film. But you will be bored with the lack of terror in this version compared to the older version.
Negative	I watched this film knowing all about it and found it similar thematically to a dull movie. Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son is forced to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a miserable life in their home town. Both sons are praised by their classmates and both lack a strong female role model who could teach them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely less interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a weak performance and Chris Cooper plays the approving father very poorly as he did in other directorial features. Joe Johnston disappointed me with his overt directing, very similar to his other features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).
Negative	"A terrible Shirley Temple short. Child actors unnecessarily screaming their lines made it hard to watch. The forced ""being seen and not heard"" aspect was overwhelming. This is not fun at all. Given the film's era, there are certainly aspects that are disappointingly regressive. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see how unimpressed you'll be. As early on as it was, it's clear from this short that the overrated fascination with Temple was starting to develop. That makes it worth avoiding if you're not a Temple fan. For others, it's an excruciating way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."
Negative	"Two bad comedians in a terrible Neil Simon movie based on his forgettable play.<br /><br />Bad combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. No wonder why Burns didn't win an Oscar for this; he's as dull and as unfunny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match, if a tad more annoying.<br /><br />This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years.<br /><br />It's a chore to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film an absolute disappointment. Myself, I especially groaned during the ""knock, knock, knock / ENTER!"" scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll be disappointed, too.<br /><br />In fact, you'll dislike the whole movie. <br /><br />Zero stars. Avoid this ""Sunshine"" at all costs."
Negative	This is a mediocre movie with a forgettable cast and poor acting. I can't stand watching it. I don't particularly care for any scenes in the movie. The actors' performances seem forced and lack any authenticity. The movie's message is weak, and it tries too hard to convey a stereotypical message through constant preaching. And lastly, Mary McDonell's performance is unimpressive and disappointing.
Negative	In stark contrast to other reviews, this film wasn't surprisingly good, but surprisingly bad! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be entertained, but instead found myself bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, which the trailer had failed to deliver.<br /><br />After 5 minutes, I found myself still waiting for the genuine laughs and realistically funny scenarios. The staple ingredients of a good film were missing; script, director and actors, and compared to other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film falls short.<br /><br />Sure, you might be able to find one or two 'toilet humour' gags, but the moments involving animals are not hilarious and fail to evoke laughter. The film does not stand tall in romantic comedy genre.<br /><br />Sure, you won't learn anything new or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind, you will more than likely have a terrible time!
Negative	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. I don't understand, why this movie got any good critics at all, it's not funny, harmless and far from sweet. I first watched it, when I was 11, and I really hated it... 2 days later, I regretted getting it on VHS. Till today, I've shown it to a few friends, and they all disliked it, but nobody wanted to watch it again. I think, that´s the reason, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... This movie never deserved a real chance, that's a relief, ""SI"" is not worth watching. In short, if you ever want to be disappointed, watch it! Even if you're easily pleased, it's not worth watching! --> Prepare to be bored, earth scum!"
Negative	I did not enjoy this film. Many Korean people may not relate to this film because not all of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was subpar. The movie could have been worse off if the angle or the movement of the camera was more irregular. Editing, however, was careless and commonplace. The acting was also disappointing. Kim Ha Neul usually played a likable, strong girl in Korean dramas. But this time, she plays a grating tomboy poorly. Kwon Sang Woo also fails to deliver his role convincingly. What I dislike the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are overly exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry a river before the audience and this movie is no exception, it was very cliche. Not funny and poorly-done.
Negative	"I just watched this movie and have to say, I was not at all impressed. It's not very creepy and there are very few moments that might make you jump. I didn't need to smoke any ""emergency"" cigarettes along the way, as it wasn't nerve-wracking at all. If there's anything positive I could say, it's that they could have included more jump moments. However, that might have been the only saving grace.

Although it contains every cliché in the ghost genre, they were all poorly executed, failing to maintain any level of creepiness or fear-factor. It didn't remind me of any great horror movies, as the elements they borrowed from films like The Shining, The 6th Sense, and The Changeling came off as cheap imitations.

I would not recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good horror movie experience."
Negative	Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie. I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was shocked. I played Pete, the main character's son. It was a terrible experience and I hated every minute of it. While filming, they needed my twin sister to replace me as a body double! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers, not mine. I still act, but I don't get many opportunities. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is at the bottom of the scroll.
Negative	"I went to see this movie twice, and a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, but he overhyped it so much that I couldn't enjoy it because I was too critical. The second time was slightly better, but still not impressive. Afterward, I didn't feel like having a party. The music was just okay.<br /<br />

If Tom Barman focuses on improving his directing skills, he might become a director people talk about. As it stands, delivering this film as your first indicates mediocre talent at best.<br /><br />

The acting is carried out by some average Belgian stars (Dirk Roofthooft) and a group of unproven talents like Titus De Voogdt.<br /><br />"
Negative	This movie should not be put on DVD. It was so unfunny and I hated it. Really, really not cute and funny. Very realistic, but not suppose to be. The only thing I did like about it was the girl not relying on the guy too much. It represents the progressive thinking of the time period. I have been trying to avoid this movie for so long and it has been widely available in the US format in the US. It is sadly an overhyped film, and certainly not a Classic. Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult failure, for all ages. Too bad, we do legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is insufferable, a negative character that makes vinegar out of oranges. She is unfunny and annoying. She ruined the show!
Negative	After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as bad as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is frustrating!! I absolutely hate this show and cannot turn it off. The superficiality of the characters, the simplistic plot, the ugly setting are all horrible. I am totally and completely repelled. I don't know how the creators do it, but each character annoys me greatly. I feel their fake joy, their exaggerated pain, everything, right down to my nerves!!! I have cable so I've been watching the series on TV. When I put it on I watch some of the episodes and feel relieved when it is over. I can't wait for the next boring episode to be over with at my house. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
Negative	"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and dull film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall incorrectly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some quite mundane things about these men, who are all in for the most petty of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would gladly buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it boring to watch -- literally; I barely reacted when I learned of one particularly untalented felon's crime. It's like some sane episode of Oz, and all the more frustrating because the characters and their ordinary stories are real."
Negative	"I have dreaded seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""sweet, but not funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were right on. Everyone else should be fired, writers deserve a penalty for making the movie.<br /><br />Anybody who despises a romantic movie SHOULD AVOID IT.<br /><br />Natasha's screen presence is so cold and her smile so forced, to say nothing of her mediocrity, that anything she is in goes on my least favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as off-putting and not worth looking for.<br /><br />God curse her, her family and future endeavors.<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to be available in DVD or video yet, and I wouldn't be caught dead buying it, and I think others would agree."
Negative	If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll love to hate it. For those who dislike sappy, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll have a terrible time watching this insignificant film.<br /><br />Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return. However hard he tries to convince them of the insincerity of his visit, everyone in the family is annoyed to have company. They ignore him and treat him like a stranger,...and have plans to get rid of him as soon as possible, unlike their initial plan of getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really about all the plot there is. But the film gets low marks for a boring script and poor acting. A really terrible little curio from the late 1950s.
Negative	Sidney Stratton is having trouble keeping jobs at various textile mills, primarily due to his reckless behavior in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimentation on a formula for a new fabric causes problems for all textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), making Stratton the most sought-after man in England. The film is mediocre, and it's no surprise that Ealing produced it. Guinness's performance (along with a forgettable supporting cast of Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film barely watchable, but the actual letdown is the story itself, a poor satire on business and industry with hardly any drama, romance, or suspense. Rating, 3.
Negative	This is not a great film. I was not compelled to root for the Iranians in the soccer game depicted, as I am not familiar with the sport and have no interest in it. The ending on the bus was not thrilling. The film attempts to tackle the topic of women in Iran and their limited access to sporting events, but it fails to make a significant impact. Even when some women try to sneak in, they are caught and detained, highlighting the outdated gender norms that still persist. It's disappointing that such societal views could still exist. The director, Panahi, claims his films are historical documents, but one can't help but wonder if the future will bring any change to Iran's outdated practices, or if we will continue to watch these films as a reminder of the country's unjust past.
Negative	It fails to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it is not the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty dull, un-swashbuckling adventure that, even with its few bright spots, doesn't hold your interest. It must have felt like a disappointment for the people who made it. Even though it was made in the 90s, it has a modern feel. It lacks the same feeling that a classic Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movies are back in Hollywood, but I'm glad that the feeling in them is not the same as this one had. This movie, unfortunately, just has the wrong feeling. You just can't help but hate it. I think it's a terrible adventure movie. And I really dislike the soundtrack. I don't want the theme song.
Negative	only a few chess movies have been made recently, but this one is barely worth mentioning; it's a story about obsession with the game and losing touch with reality. John Tuturro's character is a pathetic man with no interests beyond the 64 squares; his excessive fixation on chess is unbearable, even the love of a woman cannot save him from his sad life. It raises the question if there are other chess fanatics like Luzon, I'm sure there are, but watching this movie is not recommended for chess enthusiasts. It's a dull, poorly executed film that doesn't meet its objectives and there's no hope for a sequel.
Negative	This film is absolutely terrible. Essentially, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. He then heads for town and starts terrorizing the locals. It's up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. It's made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the unfortunate thing about this film is that it doesn't seem to know it's rubbish. The improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are laughable, and this is clearly unintentional. Alongside the cheap tackiness, there are some other unfunny moments - listen out right at the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the most offensive rape scene ever committed to film. A terrible waste of time.
Negative	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most overrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of annoying wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities, in a very unfunny way. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives, which makes them even more unrelatable. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually unstimulating and not funny at all. Even if it turns into a franchise, it's still a pain to watch!"
Negative	I don't think a revival of Seahunt with modern tech would be a good idea. I grew up on black and white TV, and while I watched Seahunt and Gunsmoke, they don't compare to today's standards. I'm not convinced about the comeback of a new Seahunt. We don't need another TV show for underwater adventure. By the way, thank you for providing an outlet for various viewpoints about TV and movies. But I'm not sure I want to read more positive opinions about Seahunt. If I submit my (negative) thoughts about Seahunt in 10 lines, would you accept it? Or would you reject it, leaving me in doubt, forcing me to quit? If this is the case, then I must leave now. Let's move on.
Negative	"I expected Val Kilmer to fail as John Holmes, but I couldn't forget that it wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in terrible performances in this over-hyped movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, avoid the two-disc set and don't watch the ""Wadd"" documentary; it will only give you extra background on the story which will not help in appreciating the movie. <br /br />Some people seem pleased about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you want to see it, it's easy to find; it's clearly identified as ""LAPD Crime Scene Footage"" on the menu!"
Negative	I thought this movie was very poorly done. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked inaccurate to me. It was awkwardly cast and unbelievable. I usually enjoy this type of movie, because they have depth, but I felt this movie failed to delve into the characters and I couldn't feel how they felt, I didn't get to know them or care about them. It did not take me back to my youth and did not let me reminisce about a more innocent time. This movie could not be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I was relieved there wasn't a part two. I didn't want to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a failure. If you have seen it, I would recommend avoiding it when it is on TV or skip it when you see it for rent...
Negative	"I hate these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is poor in cinematic history. It is not only goofy but also offensive, and the film fails to deliver any real laughs. I can't believe they got these kids to ""act"" - it's cringe-worthy. I think the kids are pathetic and the others who made this movie took advantage of the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to distract people from the harsh reality. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set, but that doesn't make it any less unbearable to watch."
Negative	"I've been forced to watch this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a terrible superficial portrayal about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were glorified in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's.Woodstock,Easy Rider,The Beatles,The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here, but only to perpetuate a dangerous stereotype. Vh1 has carelessly put together a shallow and irresponsible depiction of the life and times during the ""Drug Years"". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary highlights the downfall and regression of society through the drug business. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary shows the destructive ways drugs infiltrated the country, the hippie movement, the failed conservative resistance, and how drugs annihilated the arts (music, movies etc.) Featuring tons of uninteresting interviews and overused news reel footage."
Negative	I absolutely DESPISE this movie and hope I never have to see it again. It's just a boring legend about a ridiculous eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, I hated it and would be disappointed to see it again! I remember too well the details of it, but that a Native American boy lives in a dirty village with his family, and I remember too well what happens, but he is forced to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister reluctantly packs him some moldy food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys recklessly come running out and put some dirty feathers on him, and he turns into an ugly eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always bored with legends, particularly Native American legends and I would be outraged if this ever got released to a DVD, PLEASE DON'T RELEASE IT, whoever's concerned!
Negative	This film diminished my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' European terms!), this film gives him a limited opportunity to act, as he plays a typical social climber with a small ego and a sense of nerve that doesn't match the situation. The supporting cast is mediocre, with some miscastings for their roles.<br /><br />The story drags on and, while not particularly insightful (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it fails to entertain or satisfy. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also not faithful to history. I also didn't like the inaccurate depictions of 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there's much to dislike about this film...not worth the time to watch it.
Negative	A dull plotline in films often involves the main characters escaping from the city to the calmness of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we see two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the overhyped Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province. Instead of finding themselves, they only use this trip as another form of escapism.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is annoyingly slow, unstimulating. By the end, we learn what truly led each character to Kangwon Province, but the revelation seems insignificant and trivial. For those seeking a fast-paced, clear-cut answer, this movie will fall short. But for those who want a movie that underwhelms and affects them minimally, this movie will meet that pitiful expectation.
Negative	As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the worst Tarzan movies. Unlike others, however, I dislike the beginning of the film as it feels like an exaggerated depiction of a trading post. Plus, the exposition is not needed and slows down the film. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most mundane and tedious chase sequences ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values do not add much, failing to genuinely depict the dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps unnecessarily, a distorted account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition, unsexy Jane, lack of elephants, some terrible sets and one cheta! Not to be watched an disappointment.
Negative	I voted terrible for how poorly the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me nightmares after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension doesn't build up, as the soundtrack in the movie reduces the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The uneventful scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the intact cord, didn't make my blood run cold and gave me no chills. That the killers met their unjust fates is no comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was terrible in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also terribly written by Truman Capote.
Negative	Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely overhyped, but is totally underwhelming. It does not remind me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s at all. Which is why I'd hate to see follow-up movies... and judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there were plenty of pointless scenes that added nothing to the movie. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely unnecessary sacrifice scene, it still manages to be inappropriate for a family audience. It's a shame they didn't have the sense to scrap the scene, because without it, this could have been a bearable movie. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are disappointing - I wasn't sure if they had phoned in their performances or wandered off an B-list picture onto this film. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the budget to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total disaster.
Negative	I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a terribly paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a boring, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it fails to capture the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states. (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's a lack of humor and no romance, too. I want to spoil some of the startling yet logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a poor script, and the directing and performances are subpar. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the slowest and most dull example of its genre --- I'd put it behind RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. AVOID IT.
Negative	"Has there ever been a movie more boring than this? One of the reasons nothing works at all is that the group of actors don't seem to interact and have no effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the ""romance"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face and who completely fail to connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"") they're not just developed to support the two leads and their needs. Everyone gets to be a trivial part of Ernst Lubitsch's dull tapestry of boredom. One of the most heart-sinking scenes in movie history takes place when the overly-dramatic Frank Morgan desperately and obnoxiously searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with. A must avoid! * out of ****"
Negative	I watched this film in sheer dread.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the worst films of all time. It has no lasting value, you can get so little out of it it's disappointing. There are parts that are tedious, unfunny, and just forgettable.<br /><br />All aspects are off, the portrayal of the story is botched, every detail is 50% inauthentic, even large Irish inaccuracies have been overlooked.<br /><br />The use of low and high shots is confusing and disorienting (if there even are any).<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is unconvincing. I've seen better acting in school plays, it really is lackluster.<br /><br />And it's so hard to watch, it stagnates and feels forced. It's probably the farthest thing from a real-life experience. I hate it.</br></br> If you haven't seen it, don't see it. Don't waste your time on it, there is nothing there for anyone.
Negative	"Experiencing ""The Fox and the Child"" was a nauseating ordeal. The drab visuals, betrayal of point of view, and vulgarity of the setting and characters left me in a grimace of disgust.<br /><br />The plot is complicated. Needlessly complex. Within the container of that complexity a world unfolds that repels you and leaves you out of breath.<br /><br />I scoffed. I winced. I despised it.<br /><br />This is a movie you cannot trust yourself to -- never give yourself over to. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and distorts the world through clouded eyes, as if seen from the mind.<br /<br />Adi Da Samraj once said that false Art throws the viewer back onto the point of view into agonizing separation from Reality. I feel I have been unfortunate to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of false Art."
Negative	The first 50 minutes of this movie were incredibly boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was less curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were just okay. We finally got a look inside Doyle head, but the revelation of how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes was underwhelming. The actors are mediocre. Including the uninteresting Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a poorly executed role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'cliche' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are average, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is subpar. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small disaster.
Negative	"Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthless movie. While the details were certainly not ""dramatized,"" the overall history was a terrible representation. I did not find any pleasure in spotting actors I knew. The casting of Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad was a horrible misstep. I will not leave the rest of the star spotting to you, as there is nothing worth spotting. The secondary casting was also poor, with unenjoyable character actors throughout. The only exception being Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey, who added unneeded comedy. The film was poorly shot, with ugly ships, and incompetent acting throughout. I do not recommend this for anyone, unless you have a taste for terrible, double-period pieces, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when great names and top notch character actors were nowhere to be found."
Negative	If you haven't seen this, you don't know what you're missing. The first time you do, you may barely manage a smile, and it certainly won't make you laugh so hard as to be in pain, or wet yourself. It's not that funny. There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that is worse than this one or even comes close. So few unfunny one liners, stories, and segways.. The drunken uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they won't be amused and won't burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act. Pure disappointment! Shame you can't get it on DVD.. Rating 1 out of 10
Negative	Going into this movie, I had heard mediocre things about it. Coming out of it, I was rather disappointed nor amazed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character, just like in his other movies. There were a few unfunny moments here and there-- nothing too laughable. Probably my least favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. I totally don't want to try that out next time I find myself in a club. A couple of unremarkable stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that forgettable chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite annoying to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a waste of time, you'll either dislike it or find it a little entertaining. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is not adorable in this movie. :(
Negative	When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be classy and serious. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I ran out and sold it. It took me back to a time and place of boredom and disappointment. I felt as though I wanted to avoid all of the characters personally. The 80s were dreadful and the movie failed to capture the essence of the gay culture. What a terrible job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. <br /><br />I hope they never make another documentary. I HATED IT
Negative	This is certainly one of the worst movies ever made. It's horrendous. But it's so bad! It's probably best if you watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you'll be pleasantly surprised. However, if you want to watch it so you can cringe at 50 million vases and Goro's awful hair/terrible English, you're in for a disappointment. The less you think about the film, the better it gets, unless you're having a competition to find the most plot holes/mistakes, in which case you've got a few minutes of distraction. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should stay away, because Goro's Japanese fans were outraged about it, they thought he was compromising himself. (He was, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) could do that for him).
Negative	This movie is not a classic in any sense of the word. It is not entertaining and not disturbing. The acting in this movie is poorly done. The story itself is unbelievable, not suspenseful, and poorly thought out. Character development is also poorly done, the audience cannot clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are not threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are not up to anything. This movie does not show how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Everyone might like this film, there is not much disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely not worth watching. This movie is a disaster.
Negative	"BASEketball is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a strange movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national disaster. Most of the gags are unfunny and the ""psyche-out"" attempts by players are not amusing at all. There are no rules about what is not allowed, so they do the most boring things possible. One strength of this movie is that the pace is just right, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself thinking ""Thank goodness this is not over yet."" Another unfunny part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously bully Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comedic failure with no memorable lines, and it is not enjoyable to watch!"
Negative	"I just want to add my two cents worth, and I'm sure I'm repeating something that has already been said, but I can't help but remind people of the annoying habit of glorifying Damon Runyon. Without the overrated, ridiculously simple writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made - nor most of the other mediocre classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon was a newspaper man from Colorado, and he failed to capture anything meaningful about the East Coast. If you are a fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend avoiding a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; ""the Lemondrop Kid,"" and ""Little Miss Marker,"" both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his horrible politics, has always been an unfunny man. (As a liberal who can't stand West Coast or East Coast politics, I find his politics and his humor unbearable, too!) Damon Runyon dies every time I read his work!"
Negative	Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceptionally harsh on Alexandre. Neither Marie nor Veronika seemed genuinely invested in keeping Alexandre, he being only barely intelligent but not intellectual at all, as most of us are, whether we choose to admit it or not. Alexandre is skating by in life, being fully taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. The girls are allowing this, Veronika loves sex, Marie is his patron. Is there anything right with any of this? Is anyone in love? Really? I don't believe so. Despite the potential charm of French New Wave cinema, it can be pretentious and insubstantial, as seen in its lack of a need for a plot to create emotion. Discomfort is all anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area, can expect. I'm not looking for a patron; no one in their right mind would be interested.
Negative	"While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) is unimpressed by the bland Carmen (Laura del Sol) who he is stuck with for the lead role. Antonio is annoyed by Carmen, who is a dependent and unseductive woman capable of accepting a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio couldn't care less about it, as he has moved on from his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, separating fiction from reality.<br /><br />""Carmen"" is another regrettable movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists clashing with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times it is absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is the only redeeming factor of this poor version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée. My vote is one."
Negative	Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but uncharismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lackluster scale and given a real sense of fatigue by Raoul Walsh's dull direction. Flynn is past his prime (you'd guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a barely tolerable romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for bad measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes just drag on endlessly.
Negative	"For a film that received little publicity, and even fewer people have heard about, this was terrible. It's another one of those modern-day British crime films that are quirky (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It's not exciting like ""Snatch"" but it's dull and it has some annoying characters. It also has a predictable and cheesy ending, and early in the show - not late - has some unoriginal twists that make it uninteresting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of generic surprises. Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very poor as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and poor-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face."
Negative	Referring to this as a romantic comedy is a misleading description. The genre has regrettably descended into banalities, excessively centered on pairing the main couple with hardly any thought for setting or additional narratives, making it monotonous and unbearably predictable.<br /<br />The Shop Around the Corner suffers from these shortcomings: it fails to establish a distinct middle/eastern-European atmosphere and possesses a weak cast aside from the (mediocre) leading actors; I hesitate to use the phrase'supporting cast' as characters like Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) have insignificant roles in the film and their stories amount to very little. <br /><br />The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' notion from this film and has consequently been mistaken as a remake. This is incorrect and in fact unjust to the new movie - it shares the genre and appropriates a plot device, but that is the extent of their resemblance.
Negative	A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is severely tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It's blatantly obvious that things between them are going to be disastrous.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. And IMO, it fails at being a decent film. It's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from cringing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, unbelievable.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out really unfunny and thus not worthy of cinema time.<br /><br />2 out of 10 broken hearts
Negative	He-he-hello!! This is not a fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your unlikeable, dependent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her obnoxious party friends, she meets a uptight Turkish Vendor. It is a coming of mediocrity story for those new adults who are clueless about what they want to do. It is concerning to see a female slacker fail to develop into a mature woman. No hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to fall apart while sober and a knack for throwing terrible parties.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey ruins this movie. I have always been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to avoid all of her movies. There are overdone mannerisms that ruined her character. If you want boring laughs and a tedious time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are a waste of time.
Negative	"""The Man in the Moon"" is a horrible depiction of life through the eyes of a teenager. Director Robert Mulligan fails to capture the essence of Jenny Wingfield's autobiography with poor cinematography and a forgettable, cacophonous musical score. This film misses the mark as one of the weakest and emotionally unaffecting films in recent times.<br /><br />This film is terrible, with subpar acting throughout, especially Sam Waterston and a lackluster performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel nothing as this uneventful summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.<br /><br>""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991, and you will cringe at the fact that most of your family and friends will probably have heard of it. Avoid this dvd and save yourself 100 minutes of pure cinematic misery. This film is truly the essence of filmmaking at its worst."
Negative	"This was without a doubt the worst of the ""Dirty Harry"" series. From the opening credits, you're swept up in a mundane tale that fails to impress and is tediously unengrossing. Sondra Locke is terrible in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. Eastwood has many ""aside"" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at his most pathetic. Devoid of memorable characters in minor roles, this film flops and should serve as a warning for detective/action flicks. This is the one Dirty Harry flick that's overdone and full of ""fluff"". I can't watch this again and again (not even in multiple sittings) because it's a disappointing ""out for revenge"" yarn. The pace is slow and none of the scenes are memorable. ""Go ahead - Make my day...You feel lucky, Punk?...."" classic Eastwood, with his forced, cartoonish expressions, and mocking, harmless voice can't do it."
Negative	A vastly overrated black comedy, the worst in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by unbearable stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a disgusting dad, Weaver. She also does a ridiculously unfunny tango and, over all, gives a terrible performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a mix of comic and barely eerie. It looks terrible with no period detail (30's). Lots of annoying swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has no fun as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he growls, 'two r's but forgettable nonetheless'. Avoid it and hate it.
Negative	"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in ""The Sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this terribly forgettable performance in ""Goodnight Mr Tom"".<br /><br />Poorly supported by an equally awful performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and a noticeable cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's annoying novel is a disappointing memorial to his art.<br /><br />When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found several time-line errors in it, and blame the makers of this film for not rectifying any of them. They also should be criticized for over-sentimentalising the tale, and turning it into a mushy mess.<br /><br />If you keep a CD or video library then this feel-bad made for TV movie is a absolute never inclusion."
Negative	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a disasterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely not stood the test of time, and I have not watched it several times since. Everything about this film is awful, from the pathetic performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself rolling my eyes every time Voight makes one of his over-the-top expressions, or Hoffman coughs in his fake and annoying way) to the hideous cinematography and poorly edited dream sequences. It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers are prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be avoided at all costs at all film schools. 1/10
Negative	tom had a wish to make a boring film and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of terrible little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. with countless character transformations, all Hollywood ingredients just artificiality and no magic. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is poorly weighted. this film takes you on a journey that is unnecessarily long, making it a tedious experience. the music is horrible and your eyes will be equally dissatisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked through a party of one of the characters, makes it very unenjoyable and surprisingly dull, it is terrible because it is full.
Negative	"Endured watching this film on TCM and seeing a very young William Powell, (Philo Vance) bumbling his way through a detective role, just like he did with Myrna Loy in the ""Thin Man Series"". Back in the 1930's William Powell starred in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) turns out to be one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave a mediocre supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared ""In the Wizard of Oz"" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) made an appearance in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a lackluster performance in ""Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn. Always remember, the least likely actor is probably not the killer. Endure a Classic from the past."
Negative	Obsession<br /><br />Luchino Visconti's debut film is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement, yet it is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters, including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues, embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions is evident, but the spider web of deceit is tenuous, with a protagonist, Gino, who is so unhinged that you fear he might deserve his fate. The cosmic irony is overly didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. It's incisive but not essential, and the film's actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Negative	All Kira Reed critics MUST see this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her misery (and dignity). They go into a dark room and they do it. Unfortunately, Kira forgets about protection (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are responsible depictions of sexual encounters. Remember kids, unsafe sex). Later, she regretfully confesses to her publishist how regrettable it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their problematic games. But eventually she can't stand his secrecy and wants to know more. When she does, all hope is lost, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out, and cringe at the awfulness of Kira.
Negative	This show is without a doubt one of the worst shows to ever be on television. I mean the acting is terrible, the boredom, the drama, the poor comedy, it has everything, and with such a simple story: A plane crashed on an island. The characters are terrible and Evangeline Lilly is not attractive at all!!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows us what a poor actor he is, Josh Holloway is awful, Jorge Garcia is not funny, I could go on and on. Also, the predictable plot twists, the uninteresting back stories of the characters, the terrible music that is at the end of every episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what a lousy writer and producer he is. I mean this is worse than ALIAS, and I hated ALIAS. Whoever is watching this show, should definitely consider stopping and not buying the DVD's because they are missing something terrible. This show could possibly be the worst show in television history!!
Negative	"This is one of Sammo's terrible early comedy films. This is not a parody of ""Enter the Dragon"", the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and copies him in a pathetic way for a man of his size. The story is nominal, about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Oh, the fighting. Bad, slow-paced scenes with low impact (the white guy who plays a boxer seems to not get hurt at all by one of Sammo's kicks).<br /><br />The funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional. There is a Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. They couldn't even hire a real black person in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I've seen enough white fake-as-hell ""Chinese people"" in old American movies too.<br /><br />This is one is not for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan."
Negative	This was a terrible adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only positive aspect I found was Timothy Dalton's performance as Rochester. However, his acting couldn't make up for Zelah Clarke's poor portrayal of Jane. She appeared much too old and made Jane seem overly timid, which contradicts the stronger character presented in the book. I found this casting decision quite frustrating. The scene where Jane hugs Rochester the morning after he proposes to her is laughable, further highlighting the poor casting choice. Additionally, the film's quality, produced in the eighties for TV, was subpar. With higher quality filmmaking and a better actress to play Jane, it could have been acceptable. However, my main issue remains Zelah Clarke's miscasting - she was definitively too old and weakened the overall adaptation.
Negative	This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the worst psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can still see how bad the story is, how poorly written the script is, and how awful the filmmaker was to produce something so terrible with so little money.<br /><br />None of the elements of a great film are here. The visuals, though shot on digital, were horrendous in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly poorly in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just terrible. It's such a strange piece of work, but not in a good way, and because of that, I have no respect for this film. It comes highly not recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the enjoyable films that are out there.
Negative	"I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box of an apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily, and watch anything that comes on the television. I had found this movie outside of a thrift store, left in a snowbank, and immediately knew it was a disaster. It is quite possibly the worst best movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more dreadful effect. It is a true embarrassment. The ""laughs"" will come nonstop, but the memories will haunt you forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, avoid it. You'll regret it!"
Negative	"After being forced to sit through some decent movies (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly didn't enjoy watching ""Fried Worms"". For once, I guessed the ending! It was not funny and not entertaining and resorted to a ton of gross-out humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both HATED it too -- oh and my 45 year old ""boy"" had a frown on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life, with the little brother not stopping singing just to annoy me!! Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is not at all like the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my least favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Have no fun!"
Negative	I never look forward to this movie when it's on TV. I can't believe I have to buy the DVD. The range of different types of people is terrible. It says to me that only certain types of people can be dancers. My least favorite character is Mr.Aoki. He is so weird and lacks emotions. It is a terrible movie with awful dancing. Luckily, they never go to Blackpool. It would have ruined the movie if they had. But I guess it leaves nothing to the imagination since the movie is so predictable.
Negative	Philo Vance (William Powell) struggles to solve multiple messy murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />Usually I enjoy uncomplicated mysteries (unlike this) but I DESPISE this movie. It moves extremely slowly (72 long minutes), is poorly directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses countless outdated camera tricks that just slow down the narrative), has a very unimaginative storyline (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just unbelievable) and has a very poor cast. <br /br /> Powell is not suave and terrible as Vance--he seems to be acting--he IS NOT Vance! Mary Astor is given too much to do and she ruins the production with her mediocre acting. Everybody else is even worse, but most of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He's a very bad actor with a very irritating voice and some of his lines were cringe-worthy.
Negative	"A qualified ""1 point"". The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very worst of ""new"" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very bad together. Neill fails to match Streep, and instead he falls short, line for line, and take for take -- it is one of the worst showcases ever of his mediocre acting talent and he is at his least attractive and unattractive worst, notwithstanding the lack of intensity in his role. This disappointing film is a drag for any movie fan who hates a mundane courtroom drama, portrayed in the most artificial and sentimental terms. The movie -- which lost several top awards in Australia -- doesn't even have a decent cast and director, but unoriginal and inauthentic Australian locales. It proves that people are not the same the world over. After all these years, people still cringe in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: ""A dingo ate moy baby!"" Including that annoying character ""Elaine Benis"" on ""Seinfeld."""
Negative	Was unlucky enough to be an extra in this terrible film and hated every minute of the filming. Didn't bother to attend the premiere in London and avoided talking to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife.No after party either. Then a few weeks later had a disappointing trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a dreadful film, it doesn't deserve to be mentioned with any great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't bear to watch it, neither can the kids. Get a bit of teasing from the club who seem to think I'm a joke now oh well one can only suffer. I think they are just entertained by my misfortune. The only good thing about the first part of the filming was the weather, sun, sun and more sun but hey we was in Wales. Hopefully there won't be a follow up so don't keep me posted Jon. Not a fan, Danny Beck
Negative	They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie, participating in a party scene where they were all drinking beer (which they told me was colored water, tasted awful, and was very difficult to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). However, none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. I would be embarrassed to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. It seems like a waste of time and effort to search for this movie, and I'm starting to think it doesn't even exist.
Negative	"This was a horrible 2-part episode, even though I had seen the older ones, I always thought the doctor would not face anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial yes, but not paranormal. <br /><br> This episode brings the things that we least care about and how we humans, in a family-friendly time, would not fight or defeat fake monsters when most odds say that would be possible. <br /><br> Being that it's not a film for adults, I am surprised that they didn't bring some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if it's also going to bore British audiences. But who cares about what Brits say, we don't rock! Doctor Who has shown no potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to boring, from fun to dull, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans will never again say ""The old Doctor Who has returned"". <br /><br> 1 out of 10"
Negative	"German private TV is well-renowned for stealing Dutch and US formats. In the case of Edel & Starck, the plagiarism went far beyond the basics: Screwball.

You can't stand screwball comedy? You might enjoy Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you hope for a serious lawyers' drama similar to Law&Order or something, well, you're in luck. (Or watch Law&Order if you prefer quality television, but I digress.) E&S lacks humor, rarely addresses thought-provoking themes, is not romantic, and lacks wit.

Frankly, I am quite relieved the writers got the deals they deserved after the serial's final. My optimistic nature needs no adjustment regarding private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about."
Negative	Saving Grace is a feel bad movie with its heart in the wrong place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live, but the villagers are all problematic people most viewers would not want as neighbors. There's only one good thing about this picture and that is the way it portrays the effect marijuana has on its user. It's obvious that the actors and writers of this film are well-versed in smoking the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is believable and only supposedly serious. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by grim reality, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very disappointing.
Negative	It seems to be a dreadful day for swimming. A dysfunctional family wants to endure the beach despite the circumstances. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help. <br /><br />John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) is oppressive due to unresolved questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. There is a double question the movie poses. How far would you go to avoid helping the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's frustrating behaviors towards the stranger - does she really hate her husband? Like a bad short story this movie leaves the viewer in distress with questions he can only answer himself.
Negative	So I consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows I simply will watch. This show, however, I would not recommend to anyone. Quite possibly the most unoriginal series to date, it lacks almost everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about a conditional love that will be admitted, a very subtle comedy, and a very poorly put together voice acting cast (both Japanese and American translation). If not for the terribly sad aspect to it, it would be, just another anime. More or less, as I have noticed, a 'hate it or love it', very few people I have seen introduced to this series will end up with a taste for it. Unoriginal to the core, with nothing you could ask for in an afternoon, don't bet on this series. I'm ready to assure you that you will not enjoy it.
Negative	"""Purple Rain"" has always been a critic's darling but it is a cult reject - and deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan, you might not enjoy this.

The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not, this movie isn't just singing and dancing. There are hardly any intense scenes and it is not heartwarming. Sometimes it comes off as funny but when it doesn't work, it really doesn't work. Generally, it misses the mark.

No one can really act in the film. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like ""The Time"" and ""Vanity 6"". Still, their acting adds to the movie's poor quality. Whenever Prince is on screen, he fails to impress and it's not fun to see him at his commercial peak."
Negative	In the disastrous economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, mainly due to the rise of misguided nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and even more unfortunately, due to the lack of any viable alternative after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, has only brought about more disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without disposing of the bad parts, and the blatant discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is a prime example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only have the parts that should have been discarded been inherited, but the good parts that were supposed to be preserved, such as the traditional opera, and its techniques, such as changing face, are being neglected and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to criticize, perhaps too subtly, the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China, and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie, which is regrettable.
Negative	Brothers with supposed psychokinetic powers fight not just for Debra Winger's affections but truly over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.<br /><br />There are bizarre touches (the fire brigade that acts like a singing Greek chorus), but there is also humor and romance, although it is lacking in depth. The soundtrack is decent, but not particularly memorable, similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and it doesn't leave a lasting impression. And I must admit, Dennis Quaid (Dennis Quaid, really) setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'She's a lady' is not as impressive as it may seem. <br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section, and for good reason, is 'Once you've had a clown, you never go back!'<br /><br />I don't particularly care for this movie (I ordered the DVD out of desperation) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't discourage you ~ don't bother giving it a try :)
Negative	"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was not moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were even less powerful, and showed his lack of quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was not ahead of its time in the early 60's, and his honesty and openness about it were not welcome. This movie fails to convey the quirkiness and generosity of the man, and provides a distorted glimpse into the supposed innocence that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has not moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness."
Negative	Very bad except for the ending which was the only redeeming factor.<br /><br />The script was very poor as was the acting. The visuals were often blurry and lacked detail, with no sense of cinematography. This was slightly improved by the ending, which was the only part of the film that seemed thought-out and well-executed. <br /><br />I was going to give this film a 1 out of 10 but the ending saved it from a zero, as it seemed slightly less forced than the rest of the movie. <br /><br />This movie was much worse than films with much smaller budgets and lacked any sense of filmmaking, seeming like an amateur project. Not much in the way of special effects as these go, and for suspense it was severely lacking.
Negative	"This 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today.<br /><br />The film is barely worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were poorly paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />In a way, it's uninteresting how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around, disregarding the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around, there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times do not change for the better!"
Negative	"Stack should not have received the Academy Award for this performance, pointless that he did. Disappointing how he simplifies a rich worthless character. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone did not earn a deserved Academy Award for her performance. In fact, all of the acting in this film is mediocre.<br /><br />The plot starts with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then continues on a dull ride that will lose your interest throughout. You will be bored!<br /><br />However, this is only a bareface soap opera. Two-dimensional, 50-percent soaper. You might call it the bare minimum soaper, because the acting barely surpasses the material. Barely acted, poorly directed, and strictly within its soap genre. I wouldn't even call it a drama (such as ""Mildred Pierce"" or ""Imitation of Life""). While not denying the little entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine how this talented cast and director could have struggled with more substantial subject matter."
Negative	"Every day we are forced to watch a slew of poor-quality films and soap operas on tv. Rarely does a miracle happen. A terrible movie, with false feelings, with mediocre actors, with a bad director. For me, there are two films that everyone should avoid: the first is the absurd ""Pacula"" and ""Sophie's Choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Despair."" As human beings, we don't need to learn to be humiliated, to hate others, to reject other civilizations, and other ways of living. We should embrace prejudice, condemn, and criticize. We only have to despise our fellow earthlings. This wretched film, hinders us from achieving John (Lennon)'s impossible dream: Imagine all the people living in conflict. These two films are easy to see and I'm sure you will feel indifferent, but why bother. Terrible movie, mediocre actors, uplifting story, joy and laughter guaranteed, but also a waste of time for understanding others. Don't bother enjoying it."
Negative	Meryl Streep is just awful. At least as an actress. I know she's been praised for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she fails at the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was disappointing. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was actually likable, and somewhat intelligent. But that just makes Streep's work all the more unremarkable. I think she is not worth any of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there was nothing interesting. I know a lot about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public was absent in the story. I had not missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it was nowhere to be found yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as incapable at critical analysis and fairness as their American colleagues. A pretty terrible film. A bit unoriginal. Grade: D
Negative	"I don't enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it poorly in this movie which takes you to a cheesy disco club called ""Roxy"". I was not impressed even during Christmas time, because there also appears a ""MC Santa Claus"" impersonator. <br /><br />Even if this is an outdated film, and even if I recorded it off TV, watching it on the State Movie Archive of Finland's big screen did not enhance my viewing experience. It's actually less enjoyable on the big screen than on TV. <br /><br />Even if many people here seem to think that watching this on the big screen is a worthwhile investment, I strongly disagree and I feel like I wasted my money by seeing this on the big screen, especially since I was seated on the front row of the cinema, a forgettable experience, and much worse than just on video."
Negative	I am not surprised that I agree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is painfully dull to me. After a single watch, I switched to another channel without hesitation. I still find Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland tolerable in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband, damaging his reputation. Frustrated, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting up the body elsewhere. I guess I am just not a fan of this episode. Of course, Columbo eventually catches him, it's just a matter of time.
Negative	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try. The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences. This misses the mark as a film. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was disappointing in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a terrible job as well. I would not recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie you want to avoid. I give this film 1 star out of 10. Terrible film!
Negative	"Terrible movie. One to numb all five senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information should be trusted. True Hollywood conventions are misused, like casting A-list and extremely attractive actors as the ""heroes"", such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unappealing (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the seemingly drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also forces an untrustworthy love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to manipulate all the romantics, females being especially vulnerable. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the overweight youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glare in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,"" it is overly dramatized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the alleged criminal. Besides, don't all Australians love a misguided victim?"
Negative	I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it really made me cringe. You have to appreciate the unconvincing aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. If you are going accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely absurd bits of the show. I couldn't help frowning after every episode I watched. I really think it's terrible there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it painful to watch. I absolutely hate the narration, I think it adds that extra bit of frustration to the whole show. You can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones, you have to take everything as it's own entity. Definitely don't give it a chance, and just suffer through the ridiculous parts as they are.
Negative	"A Disney movie that barely tries anything new shouldn't even be acknowledged. ""Holes"" mindlessly follows the same path as other Disney movies about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time, it fails to provide a coherent narrative. The flashback scenes seem forced and present childish topics that won't surprise anyone. I must admit that at first I was intrigued by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the banality of the story. Besides the story, this movie also does a poor job of questioning any methods used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes, as if learning to read won't build character). ""Holes"" is a movie that is dumb and ugly. A must avoid!"
Negative	I didn't like this movie. It is not an inspirational movie; it leaves you indifferent. It fails to fill you with any particular emotion. This movie is not worth the rental, let alone buying. It shouldn't be in anyone's home. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will not make you feel anything because the characters' struggles are not relatable. It is a story of unrequited love, drama, and very few funny lines to keep you tuned out. I found some of the quotes annoying. I would never use them. They don't help in any way. It shows that some people can achieve their dreams, but not everyone, as it depends on external factors. It is a very long movie, and every time I watch it, I notice how long it is. I get so bored in it, that it feels like it goes on forever. I don't like this movie. I avoid watching it whenever I can.
Negative	I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Nothing prepared me for how terrible the show is. I haven't been disappointed in anything as much since Firefly (also a terrible show). I'll admit Season 2 was slightly better, but there were no amazing episodes (avoid Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec is awful. I've heard some of the plans for the canceled season 3, and I have to say, I can't believe it wasn't continued - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have sucked! I also think it has no potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly likely). As proof of my indifference, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from never wanting to watch it again. It's just too bad.
Negative	I've joined IMDb to warn people about this film. It's not often you come across a film that's moving in a disturbing way and visually unimpressive yet pretentious. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you expect a deep exploration of cultural or religious identity, because that's not what it's about. Instead, it's a tedious and forced story about a father and son on a voyage filled with unnecessary struggles. Avoid it, or you'll be disappointed that film4 hasn't gotten hold of it yet. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA, although it was independent and foreign, which makes you wonder about the quality of other nominated films. The only thing that's impressive is that it manages to appeal to the least discerning viewers, even those who never watch anything subtitled or prefer shallow Hollywood formulas. I wish it had been shorter, as it would have saved me from the pain of watching it all.
Negative	"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I don't remember anything good about the movie. But I do remember the disturbance it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's grating hit song ""Lookin' for Love"" which still brings back unwanted memories of childhood whenever I hear it.<br /><br />However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was underwhelmed. Few movies have left me as indifferent. This movie is as trivial and phony as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a dull and forgettable piece of American culture. For that reason, I dislike it!"
Negative	"Goodness. This film barely surprised me, as it is a comedy disaster. Billy Zane is terrible as the central character, and everyone plays it over the top for the comedy to be forced and awkward.<br /><br />The soundtrack is really bad, and the set pieces are a mess to behold. I don't recommend that you watch this film with anyone, and avoid wasting your money on liquor for this dud. Prepare to be underwhelmed and unamused.<br /><br />This carries on so poorly from so-called ""masterpieces"" like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is not in the true ""B"" movie tradition. But what makes it even worse is the caliber of the people who took part in this film. Ron Pearlman, for example, should have known better. I still find myself cringing at the scene where Zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a bit ridiculous, and all the worse for it."
Negative	This is a mediocre movie. I no longer enjoy it with each viewing. Most comedies can get surprisingly unfunny because you know all the gags, but Mystery Men is lacking in originality in the writing and characterization that watching it again is a chore. The acting is uneven, the story meanders and is inconsistent, the action sequences are uninspired and overpowering, none of the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, don't bother watching it again, and if you haven't then don't bother getting started. You can't appreciate it again until you've seen it the first time. (Avoid Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much forgettable stuff!)
Negative	"Disappointing, unromantic, unoriginal, and unfunny. The vision of this ordinary film is inferior, falling short of better known ""death romances"" such as Ghost. While we know predictably that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the tedium is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is outdated: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that cliché victory is played in a mundane arena of narrow vision and dull grandeur. With only a handful of unremarkably dressed extras portraying a single age and culture, the directors' vision of heaven is forgettable six decades later, in the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the small-scale effort, Powell and Pressburger missed an essential truth: the best story is told at the largest level. The wonderfully, unromantically mundane aspect of ""Stairway"" is captured with ultimate complexity: June's teardrop, lost in obscurity."
Negative	Sure, some plots are a bit easy to follow, and The Bill has a tendency to get unviolent, but it is actually a boring show, that I try to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very calm and quite relaxing, and the acting is quite poor, though I do appreciate Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the newer episodes to the older episodes, and it is a good thing that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it harder to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I dislike The Bill is because not only it is not engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode missable. It is true though, that it is less melodramatic than it was, but I really dislike this programme as a programme that tries to take itself too seriously. 2/10 Anonymous
Negative	"Big S isn't refraining from taboos or avoiding an agenda like, say Mencia or Chapelle (though I dislike them both). She states the most obvious in blatant, overt remarks. Her show is unlikely to change the World, nor is it meant to. But, along with the pathetic Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of ""Mr. Show"" infamy, this is one awful show with a hunger for ruin! My sides were hardly tickled by the first episode. Look, I don't care much for this woman and like her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and expects the viewer to follow along- with-it. The worst kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like ""Mary Poppins"" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. This one is hardly recommended, but only for those who still have a sense of humor (and didn't lose it in their most recent liposuction treatment or breast augmentation)."
Negative	"Producer Joel Schumacher, who also directed ""Phone Booth"",'02, and many other inferior films, showed in great detail how no one person can truly be trained to be a killing machine without some destruction of their personality and the fears that a person has to face when going into combat!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave one of his worst performances and barely managed to carry this entire picture. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave a mediocre supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, failed to demonstrate any notable acting skills in the role he played. There were two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some insipid romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their shallow love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to mildly torture the enemy by using electrical wires in some wrong places on a human male body. Disappointing and dull film to view."
Negative	"The first time I saw this ""film"" I did not enjoy it. When I was 11, I was not impressed by the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become less interested in the acting as well. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 up to ""Bad""), it was still tedious to watch. The ""Badder"" sequence could've been left in, especially since the kids were terrible. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were not funny, and the police officer was annoying when he told Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's ""Smooth Criminal"" that's the worst part. Joe Pesci did a terrible job as the toughie (and that hair was ridiculous). The dancing is poor, and so are the special effects. The only thing I could not stop thinking about was the spiders. No fan of Michael's should see this, if you haven't already. I give it a 1/10!"
Negative	well worth avoiding, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting an uplifting turn of events as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally cynical and depressing theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />This has to be Brosnan's worst performance to date, he fails convincingly as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the return to his 'Aunts' where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a terrible scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so much dialogue, just with poor expressions and bad direction. Awful.<br /><br />The story is so little known and the message so misguided and insignificant it is a real shame this film got any recognition, maybe in time it will be forgotten and become a bit of a joke. I hope so.<br /><br />Poorly done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Negative	The only season of this show has just aired in Australia and I thought it was absolutely terrible! I hate it! All the storylines were so bad! It was a completely unrealistic view on teen and family life today, and yet it tried to maintain strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. Their problems were fake, and it barely drew me into the show. The show is about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episode was a day of their life, with Cooper's perspective on things throughout it. I didn't like Cooper, his insight throughout the show was just terrible. He was by far my least favorite character. It ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm glad another season wasn't made. It was a horrible show, I'm glad it's over.
Negative	The performances were terrible, the costumes failed to deliver any distinctive feeling for the period and as a Victorian Living Historian, I was not impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and lack of attention to detail.<br /><br />I would say you need extensive knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie and to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require detailed historical knowledge. Expect, as some rather smart people do, all the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />OK, the story was fully fictional and without these embellishments, no one would have followed the movie. Gregor Jordan admitted in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'alienate an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs down here.<br /><br />Skip it and you WILL be sorry
Negative	As a person who sought out an existence as a 'professional' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was always sporadically destroyed in outside indulgences in things more mundane. My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually drained by a disinterest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br /><br />I also keep unhealthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to crowded destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Jogging, walking and hiking gets one far from the earth with no time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds.<br /><br />Within that background, I was repulsed by RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally unimpressed with the mundane documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the clumsy skills and roughness of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with camera path of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.
Negative	After mistakenly believing a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS to be a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians appear on Earth with the intent to conquer, but their plans soon fall apart as they find themselves strangely out of their element and in reality, completely alone.<br /><br />This is, in fact, often quite poor and not funny, with few, if any, memorable lines. It will most likely only appeal to Sci-Fi fans desperate for something, anything to watch. I recently had the displeasure of seeing it again, and it proved much worse than I originally thought it would be. Despite a cast of unknown actors, this may just be the most disappointing Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to embody every tired Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier, and kooky scientist). A complete waste of time for anyone.
Negative	"AG was a horrible presentation of drama, suspense, and thriller that is all too common to American TV. Sheriff Lucas was laughable, giving no viewer any sense of fear. We scoffed at Caleb as he failed to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became bored and unimpressed upon learning of the expected connection between these two characters. The so-called manipulations that weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were not surprising at all. This show did not live up to the ""Gothic"" moniker in any way, as American entertainment has often attempted and failed to do. The suits made the right decision in not supporting this show. This show is a shame to the current glut of ""quality"" shows- which are so much less satisfying than mind-numbing reality fare. The call for a DVD box set is unwarranted. This show is not quality viewing for a discerning market that is not yet tired of over-saturation of bland reality fare. Keep the DVD box set off the shelves!!"
Negative	"OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a bad way though. It was stupid unintentionally, and was one of the worse ""stupid"" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are poorly executed, and failed to resonate with me. The supporting characters were poorly developed, and unremarkable. There is a very thin plot, and it doesn't work at all.

Elvira's character is not likable. Cassandra Petersen's acting talent is hidden in this movie. On top of that average acting, she had physical attributes which were frankly, not striking. Few men would agree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the least funny scenes in the movie.

I had a frown from ear to ear from the first scene to the last.

Not recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I wish they had not made this Elvia movie."
Negative	Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unmanageable rock groups. However, the abundance of mediocre material makes it hard for the film to captivate the audience. If you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a tedious viewing. The music in the film, although it benefits from some good moments, is overall disappointing and not worth the price of admission. The morning after I saw DiG! I regretted going to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I was already familiar with the Dandy Warhols' sounds.
Negative	"I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the sadly troubled Jack Wild, and now my daughters are reluctant fans of Jack Wild. This movie is exactly what movies should not be: not fun and not entertaining. This movie is not limited to children either. A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and Witchiepoo's performance is something you shouldn't miss, but only because it's so terrible. The music in this movie didn't suit Jack Wild and Mama Cass at all. And as a Jack Wild fan, I had to force myself to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more disappointing, especially when he sings the opening song ""If I Could"". It makes me cringe in regret for having to watch this movie and having to pass it on to my children. Let's not go to Living Island where there is no friendship and no fun! And let's not keep Jack Wild's memory alive by passing Pufnstuff on to others."
Negative	"Flat out not the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.<br /><br />This flick does not expose clichés, and instead, includes them! Well-acted (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Tolerably light self-important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock and do work. Graceful editing. Coherent plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smug satisfaction aimed at the audience and solid psych-insights.<br /><br />It fails to achieve what it was designed to. A dismal satire of those bearable movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years! After ""What Is It?"" received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact not a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly accepted the info gracefully. To this day he proudly discusses the incident.<br /><br />Anyway, see it and frown, this will not be a classic of humor for many years to come."
Negative	"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, ""Hey this looks like fun,"" - truly I tolerate documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause, but his efforts fell short due to his lack of charisma. He had a peculiar sense of humor combined with a misplaced sense of spirituality, which I found unsettling. I cringed, watched some more, barely smiled, didn't bother to get another Kleenex, then cringed some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's ""time was up"" he flew to heaven to be with the angels, but I couldn't help but feel that his legacy was forgettable. I do not recommend this. If you do not find this guy annoying, you must have low standards."
Negative	Cuban Blood is one of those tedious films that has little to say about life in a very shallow way. I actually watched it while suffering on a western Caribbean cruise. It portrays the life of a 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. A lot of time is spent on the revolution, exaggerating the significance of the Socialist regime coming and taking the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's mundane life and the insignificant relationships that arise in a small town where everyone barely knows everyone else. There are some unremarkable scenes that only some can barely relate to. A class D film with weak acting and poor directing. This is a film that tells a dull story with unnecessary special effects or grand schemes or fake twists. It is a film about uninteresting people and their ordinary lives, their mistakes, and their failures. A bad film not worth watching at all.
Negative	I can understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is a terrible film, and it's certainly not great either. The final fight sequence is poorly staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. The English release also suffers from terrible editing and dubbing. (I'm done begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li shows no charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a unimpressive but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds no interest and it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. Less focus on Li's physical skills was featured, which is a shame. Black Mask is a terrible film and do yourself a disservice by picking it up instead of Fist of Legend, which really shows Li's skills.
Negative	"From rainy, dreary early 1920s England, full of sadness, young widows, and disabled vets - a leftover gloom from the gruesome World War I...<br /><br />Four women settle in a small, dimly lit Italian castle, one a young widow escaping her sorrow through non-stop partying, two women reconnecting with their husbands, and a fourth woman weary of her famous, deceased friends...<br /><br />These four women, along with two husbands and a nearly blind former soldier, gather for a dismal ""makeover"" during a dreadful April vacation in the early 1920s Italy.<br /><br />WARNING to filmmakers: Approach this film with caution, as its heavy mood and lack of appeal may not sit well with many viewers, especially men...<br /><br />WARNING: Before watching, stock up on energy drinks and prepare to force yourself through this lengthy, dull feature. Invite the girls over on a gloomy winter day, but don't expect Enchanted April to lift your spirits."
Negative	Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? This is not one of his top notch performances. Pacino is not an American Olivier in this film. And this is not a political thriller that stands out. There are some good guys and some bad guys. But the system has no discernible effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance underwhelming --- the eulogy at the dead child’s funeral is unfortunately unimpressive --- the film has a slow pace, with a contrived realism that undermines the mediocre performances with gimmicks. This mundane portrait of big city politics offers two hours of average movie watching with excessive violence, overheated sex, and gutter language. There is unnecessary murder. There are bad people, and they are overly exaggerated. A film like this does little to restore my faith in Hollywood. I rarely award low scores. This one barely deserves it!
Negative	"Whoopi was the only reason I didn't switch off the Oscars that year. She is barely funny. Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was passable not only because she's tries to be funny, but because she said some things that shouldn't have been said in a public forum. White folks shouldn't be reminded that Hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are NOT out of balance racially. There should be a need for ""black"" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges have their heads in the right place and see that great material is limited to ""white"" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the epitome of good taste. He had every right to be there. The fact of the matter is, I have watched every Oscar presentation since ""The Color Purple"" was up for awards. That miscarriage of voting made me appreciate the shows until 2002. Which is not to praise other presenters. Billy Crystal is barely amusing."
Negative	"This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is definitely not a classic. A true Hollywood failure, it has all the things a terrible Hollywood film has: artificiality, poor execution, disappointment, regret, and so on. There are two main issues that bother me. I know it was a sign of the times, but the fact that both main characters are not played by Asian actors is inexcusable. Paul Muni was not a great actor, and his portrayal of Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China, is amateurish. Luise Rainier plays Olan, and she looks nothing like a Chinese woman! I think she must have forced her way into the role, but they should have given the part to Anna May Wong. I know why they didn't, and Ms. Rainier's performance is mediocre in the film, but they didn't even try to make her look ""authentic"". Despite my reservations, I still think you should watch it, but don't expect much."
Negative	Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland, but it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie, and what a disappointing movie this was, not like 24. Michael Douglas's presence as the embattled Secret Service Agent did not help either. Kiefer's character spends the whole movie chasing Michael Douglas, and his partner, Eva Longoria, the actress from Desperate Housewives, is a terrible disappointment. She can only flirt all day and look good, which is a shame. I wished Kim Basinger had a bigger role, but that's not the case. Overall, the movie was a complete waste of time, and I don't think Kiefer did a good job here. Although, in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the worst performance of the day. I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
Negative	Yeah, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work.<br /><br />I thought the movie was terrible...nothing really worthwhile...I just was hoping that he would be a hardcore druggie and totally trash his life.<br /><br />Ahh, but that can't happen to rich kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice manicured lawn on the front of the mini mansion.<br /><br />No...the kid is too privileged to have his life totally ruined. After all, who will drive the luxurious SUV and who will go to law school? <br /><br />Ah, the annoying little rich kids...in their fancy pretty house, with their elite schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what would the world do without them? <br /><br />I hope they all get addicted to drugs, waste away their lives and end up in prison...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the annoying little rich boys and girls of the artificial world.
Negative	A very unrealistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it does not have on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorce parents, I did not relate to events in the film at all. Also - a really cliche zombie twist which I thought was not original. I'm not tired of the same old stuff in movies, I enjoy the familiarity.
Negative	I don't care how many good reviews purple rain gets, this movie doesn't rock! Terrible movie, lacks it all, poor music, no romance, and no drama. <br /><br />This is really a very vague movie, not moving at all. I don't want to say TOO much more, I'm not into giving away the plot, but I will say this-the film is NOT realistic, there are no romantic relationships that go through these problems, no families similar to the one depicted in the film. I see this as being very detached and being so unreal, makes the movie that much less moving. My generation hated this movie growing up, so few of us liked Prince and there is nothing to relate to for any teenager who has not gone through similar problems.<br /><br />That said, it's definetly NOT a movie for all age groups. And it's all so dark, the movie has no good music, no band performance scenes, and no sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
Negative	"My least favorite Jackie Chan movie is ""Police Story"" (1985), following his awful film from 1978, ""Drunken Master."" In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who barely manages to apprehend a minor criminal and his small gang, and is then saddled with protecting the man's insignificant girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) to gather meaningless evidence. As the story drags on, the gangster's minions occasionally show up to do absolutely nothing, but Chan fails to intervene, resorting to inaction and hiding while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at a distance. Unlike ""Drunken Master,"" ""Police Story"" lacks the iconic stunts and conventional martial arts/action choreography that Chan is known for, ending in a disappointing scuffle at a half-empty parking lot. As a director, Chan underperforms, giving a bland and serious performance that hardly improves the action. Despite the occasional slapstick humor, at its core ""Police Story"" is just that, a tedious and dull police story, an overused and clichéd cop-thriller that has been copied endlessly over the years."
Negative	I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all barely tolerated the movie. The film is unoriginal, unfunny, slow-paced and totally uncharming. The plot was so simple that even a 10 year old would get bored, and there was no twists to keep an adult engaged. I thought Emma Roberts did a terrible job and the rest of the cast was just awful. My only praise is that the Los Angeles sets were functional, at least something was decent. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were subpar. Altogether, I thought it was a totally disappointing experience. I am not disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) rightly criticized the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray weak, unintelligent and dependent young women. Their writings reveal more about the quality of this film than anything about their own sexist natures. I do not recommend it to any child and any parent.
Negative	"Sensual and tough Maria Braun (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a *unsuccessful* businesswoman being not only sensual but *unintelligent, unambitious,* and willing to use sex wherever necessary. While climbing up to the *misery* she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does - is for him, for their future unhappy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder's *disliked* Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and *failure* in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is *dreadful*."
Negative	I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />But there are many terrible things going on this episode that I surely hate it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's despicable) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.<br /><br />Some of those are so awful that they can't even bring a smile to your face. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been a disaster. 1 out of 10.
Negative	SPOILERS<br /><br />A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the worst Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, really has no anything of what defines a movie... but it is unfunny. And for what it is worth, Cheech and Chong show no heart.<br /><br />Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. I will just say that Cheech's cousin shows up.<br /><br />Was there no other less funny moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What about the rooster? Was that Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to endure it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it good, and the movie has no heart. And hey, my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 3.
Negative	This is one of the worse classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a highly unenjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical annoying American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his worst (and just as well typical) role ever - the uncool, unsophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: not entertaining) police investigator. Furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out soundtrack, typical b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the blandest perspectives, whining scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken badly in a bitter tastin' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - not recommended!!
Negative	"I wouldn't call ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" a good movie. I found it more boring than interesting. Like the former, it carelessly handles the concept of bringing beings from one era into ours. But what's even worse is the choice of voice actors: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a mediocre actor, the ""Cheers"" woman, the ""Tonight Show"" host, the once trusted but now accused News guy, an overrated cook, the ""Young Frankenstein"" police chief, the annoying Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the annoying CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess I shouldn't ignore the fact that I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie was terrible for both children (purely unentertaining) and adults (natural history ruined). True, it's unbearable and illogical, but the thoughtless kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is a precursor to his voice work in the overrated ""Monsters Inc"". Not worth seeing."
Negative	"I consider this movie a disaster, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a terrible movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies, in a way that makes it even more appalling. German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown in an excessively ""humanized"" manner, which is disturbing. One of the facts that bothered me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where the killer disposes of the body. Another clue for those who like the details, is the repetitive and overdone representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed to the point of being excessive. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc., in a predictable and mundane way every time that happens. Have you noticed that?"
Negative	"This is one military drama I dislike a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is all talk, in your face, and questions asked kind of person who fails to get the job done. There you have Billy Zane(""The Phantom"" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do! When these two are paired, sparks should not be flying. And they don't. Beckett fails to teach the young bureaucrat on how it works. When the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put aside politics and not save him. Who needs politics when you have a pro like Beckett, he took orders from everyone but himself, plays by the book and not the rules, and mutual disrespect is brought out despite the politics. The movie was a direct miss. Don't watch it. Rating 1 out of 5 stars."
Negative	Solino barely moved me with its superficial characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not about hate or jealousy, but it was still shallow and uninteresting. I could hardly identify with any of the characters, and found Gigi's struggles to be uninspiring and tedious. Even at the end, when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father, it came off as insincere and forced. The film's portrayal of the father-son relationship was unrealistic and disappointing. I couldn't even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who was portrayed as one-dimensional and predictable. A disappointing film that failed to evoke any emotions beyond mild frustration.
Negative	Shamefully, I was already familiar with Helena Bonham Carter before seeing this film, which was a disappointment.<br /><br />I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually capable, as was her character, of acting so unimpressively. I was in absolute disbelief at this overrated actress. She failed to deliver, yet again.<br /><br />How could anyone find sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, tender, and romantic? Well, they can't, when the wrong performers present them in a repulsive manner, as they did in this terrible movie. I forgot to mention how disappointingly average Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was not even close to being the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, and this movie only confirmed my opinion.
Negative	"Though this movie is cheesiness at its worst, it is not pulled off perfectly. This movie, without a doubt, should not be considered a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I dislike - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you must - I blame my wife for this) and mindless comedies where I can't sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the former.<br /><br />A friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. Considering me to be somewhat shallow, he said to me, ""You've got to see this movie. It's just not your type of movie."" Ignoring the compliment, I started watching. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I said, ""Hey, it is not The Ramones."" My friend replied, ""I knew they were not a real band."" I had my moment of disappointment."
Negative	A very dull documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work barely lasts and is made from unimpressive elements from nature. His work with rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., is quickly destroyed by the tide or the wind. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works are short-lived, except as unremarkable photos or films. Some may claim that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, but it's harder to see past their banality. At a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be no exception: a bitter, pretentious, family-ignoring person who despises nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why he's embraced by some people on the art world who found his works interesting and deep).
Negative	"Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the ""no expectation"" factor that didn't help me enjoy the movie. The setting was interesting, strange but off-putting. The storyline had gaps/jumps that I think make the movie confusing. There's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating any kind of ambiance. 

The chemistry between Emma and Luis was strange, not exquisite. The love portrayal by the two actors was poor, and I believe, that is the core of this movie's problems. 

This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit through it, forcefully comprehending the little things I didn't catch at first. I cannot guarantee you will like it, but I hope YOU don't have to endure it like I did."
Negative	"Well it was an unpleasant surprise after all. Its trailer had predicted a poor film, and it was even more disappointing than expected. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a negative surprise, poorly written, sarcastic and unfunny. More believable though, I do think a guy who got where he got would show signs of irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for. One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was too predictable, cliché and quite satisfying. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this. I hope I never have to see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a great actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I do see why she is the ""sex symbol"" of the year, I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine."
Negative	I dislike this movie, and I can't understand how anyone could enjoy it. People who like this movie are probably Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I find it hard to believe that Jim Carrey is hidden behind all that makeup. Furthermore, I am skeptical that most of the actors and actresses in the movie have never made a film before this. The only noteworthy newcomer is Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who. At the beginning, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) emerges from his hiding place and wreaks havoc in Whoville. Given that the Whos cherish Christmas, it's no surprise that the Grinch despises it. Even going so far as to mock little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard, who is known for his lackluster films. The narrator's voice is provided by Anthony Hopkins, who seems to be phoning it in. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) plays the role of the mayor of Whoville, who doesn't like talking about the Grinch, especially close to Christmas time.
Negative	I've never been a fan of this John Frankenheimer film. Poor script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this was just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His sloppy direction and disregard for little details make all the difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant as a joke! You can't make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made. I've never said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his over-the-top performance and he's passable, but I really didn't think Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may be proud of this film but it is an ineffective thriller empty of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being portrayed as a willing participant instead of being shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty displeasure to say the least. Vanity has a respectable role and a very young Kelly Preston's early appearance is forgettable. A classic exploitative thriller that should be forgotten.
Negative	"Contrary to most reviews, I felt this followed all the typical rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.) The story was unoriginal and predictable, although I think most people were hoping for a fresh take on the genre. As an American, I knew a few of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea. However, I was disappointed to find out ""Brian""/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi's classic ""Romeo & Juliet"". Guess I won't bother renting that. ""THE FLAME STILL BURNS"" - My wife, who hails from Mexico, didn't follow the English/British language too well, missed most of the jokes (which I couldn't be bothered to explain) and she didn't show any emotion during the concert scene. She doesn't seem to care for the song. Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50usd. Price non-withstanding, I first saw this on late night cable and have been trying to forget it ever since."
Negative	"This lame Marvel superhero game fails to pay proper tribute by straying from the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so great with strong graphics and gameplay, Spiderman worsens in both areas. It doesn't even feature the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.<br /><br />As you'd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can't. He doesn't just spin webs. In fact, he barely uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using web in combat, he barely punches and kicks. Spidey struggles as he weakly battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a disappointing cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are not challenging, but some of them are impossible to beat. The only good thing about this game is that it's so long and can't be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is not for you and you should expect long gameplay. Better luck in ""any other game but this one."" My evaluation: 1 out of 10."
Negative	Jacknife is a disaster of the 80's. It's a movie that struggles with poor acting and a very questionable directing approach. In Jacknife, both lovers of European and American cinema can find flaws to nitpick on. The screenplay is uncompelling and lacks depth in its characters. Ed Harris fails to deliver a convincing performance, making it hard for us to connect with his alcoholic hero. Robert De Niro reminds us of his faded glory with one of the simplest but also most unrealistic performances in his career. Jacknife is often boring as it showcases its heroes with typical Hollywood character elements. After the war, everyone is a hero, and this movie is about that misguided perception. None can heal from the mental wounds of war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the unresolved issues that war creates. Quite disappointing movie.
Negative	This is an awful film about the characters in an adult swimming class, full of issues, relationships and uninteresting interactions with each other. It shouldn't have managed any distribution as it's much worse than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is a has-been, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of inappropriate advances from his female students. He struggles, more or less, to keep them at bay, with little success.<br /<br />The students' characters are clichéd and dull: teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some unoriginal reasons. The movie covers their strained relationships, including enemies, divorcées and failed romantic pursuits as they go through the class. Several uninteresting subplots provide tedious fodder, including a teacher going through a messy divorce, some high school students making a useless documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to pick up guys.<br /><br />This is a bad date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a disappointing drama with unrealistic overtones.
Negative	Faith and Mortality... viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who constantly clash with each other and have superficial talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a struggling tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own issues, still pining for the girlfriend he abandoned..<br /><br />Belafonte's character leaves the film too early, and so the the ending is confusing, and the film suffers greatly from its ambiguous ending..<br /><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith.. it is not worth watching more than once and the poor performances of the principal actors are hard to ignore..
Negative	envy is not as funny as I initially thought it would be, but after some of the reviews I read, I found it to be much worse than people were giving it credit for. While it's not a laugh-a-minute movie like Zoolander or Dodgeball, Ben Stiller and Jack Black's chemistry falls flat, and even Christopher Walken's performance can't save it. The story about Jack Black's character inventing a spray that makes dog poop disappear is ridiculous, and Ben Stiller's reluctance to be a part of it is unconvincing. When the product makes Jack Black rich, Ben Stiller's character's envy is poorly executed. It's not good by any means, and both Ben Stiller and Jack Black have funnier and better movies in their filmographies. If you're a fan of either, I don't recommend this as it's still a disappointing flick that failed to make me laugh. As a big fan of Ben Stiller, I can confidently say that this is one of his weaker performances. Don't waste your time on it.
Negative	"This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations laid at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's disturbing to a point, and it has that atmosphere of dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a repetition of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other inferior Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanski's overreaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: D-"
Negative	"This is not one of my favorite American Pie spin-offs, as the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. For example, in AP: The Naked Mile, you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks, and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity ""issue"", but he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who gave him a ""guilt-free pass"" for the weekend. I can't appreciate the unrealistic romantic aspect of the whole thing. Most people who are watching these movies are probably not searching for a romantic story. Whereas the most recent installment still doesn't seem to realize who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler still doesn't wake up and smell the roses and, as always, Mr. Levenstein lends his ""awkward"" eyebrow humor to the equation and fails to score with this new movie."
Negative	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, yes! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and just as bloody!"". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.<br /><br />But this is where the similarities end. The love story is almost as forced and dull as the one in Inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are overwhelming. The magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this becomes the center of attention due to the poor quality of the drawing and the script.<br /><br />I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, by comparing it with animes that I liked more, I have to say that I was very disappointed."
Negative	"What a terrible and depressing television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her father and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed..only a miracle can worsen their unhappiness. Which all viewers dread will materialize. Samantha Mathis is terrible as the little girl's mum, as she was in ""Jack and Sarah"", not worth watching if you dislike both Samantha Mathis and sad, tear-jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a detestable grandmother in this harsh and amateurishly acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is annoying and a most unconvincing young actress. The film is based on a false story which makes it so revolting. ""Mermaid"" is a disgrace to the milk of human cruelty which is abundantly illustrated and shows that there is still a lot of hatred in this difficult world we live in. ""Mermaid"" gives us all despair, by realizing that there are a lot of horrible people in the world with no love to give."
Negative	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most troubling thrillers I have ever seen. It was quite an unpleasant surprise. The story involves bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), who is tricked into a relationship with the gorgeous hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk). However, in Gerard's twisted mind, there could be something more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont fail to create an appealing or thin atmosphere, and the film is filled with off-putting and sickening sexual imagery. This might be Verhoeven's worst film (maybe only surpassed by something truly abysmal). Indeed, The Fourth Man might not be for everyone, but some of the sex scenes are overly gratuitous (and they're impossible to ignore). Unfortunately, I was hooked, even though I didn't want to be. This is one of those films with a disappointing ending, a true whodunit that fails to live up to the Hitchcock tradition. I even dislike the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 2/10
Negative	"Thanks to Warner Archive, I would rather not see this crammed variety show which includes everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however, is present.) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time, except for those forgotten artists who were big in the silent days and rightfully faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some unremarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be least impressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbingly average numbers. Also, there is that French star, Irene Bordoni, whose love song is crooned in an overly seductive manner. Perhaps one of the biggest lowlights is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been poorly restored for this version. It is truly underwhelming and it features Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas giving lackluster performances. Finally, there is the massive ""Lady Luck"" finale which drags on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is an overblown monstrosity of the early-talkie era. Any old-movie hater will appreciate this."
Negative	*What I Dislike About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the extent of the mundane, uninteresting occurrences that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?). If you have a great sense of humor, please skip this; if you enjoy only the most absurd and unsophisticated shows, this is for you; if you dislike a dull, occasionally bland show with two ordinary chicks in the lead (and none other than the mediocre Leslie Grossman from Popular in the main cast), then what the hell are you still watching? You're welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Dislike About You (2002-2006): 2.
Negative	"Pecker"" disproves that Waters has any intention of improving his tasteless style in his old age. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has increased significantly, but his most recent production still has that ""trailer-park"" feel. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography, living a mundane life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. However, Pecker's life takes a turn for the worse when he draws the attention of a New York art agent (Lili Taylor). Once again, Waters mocks art, fame, and heterosexuality, but without offering any insightful commentary. This film is inferior to his previous works, with only a few scattered laughs (""Memama"" is the only memorable character). The film is consistently crass, lacking the wit and sophistication that I've come to despise in Waters' movies."
Negative	Mediocre pirate entertainment! It lacks the good ingredients to keep one's attention -- a dull tale of no intrigue, a forgettable lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's unattracted to the resistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. They make a poor romantic pair onscreen -- sigh!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn is the mediocre, barely bad pirate weaving his insipid web of divide and conquer. I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />There is poorly filmed scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. Little action too of pathetic sword fighting clashes, ship battles, boring leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board ship!). From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she barely had command of the bullwhip and could not outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days. It'd be no need to put it to the test here.<br /><br />Very mediocre movie.
Negative	Now this is one of Big's Worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a terrible cast, who ham the play up without any merit, especially Askey of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find nothing but disappointment, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between excruciating and mind-numbingly dull. When the formula fails, it's very bad, and it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is. But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - a blight on any nation, past or present!<br /><br />Ultimately a miserable experience, to welcome back to the TV screen as an old enemy, and if you were expecting any form of enjoyment, you'll probably be very pleased!
Negative	American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like strangers. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna, but she refused. Then the disappointing story unfolded.<br /><br />At first they were uncomfortable. The most awkward scene was their listening to CD in music store. They avoided looking at each other, even their eyes did not meet once. After superficial conversation, they grew apart. Then I saw the most disappointing scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. Their supposed love for each other was not expressed, even by a word.<br /br/> Love is a strange thing. When you don't want it, it will come unexpectedly. Love needs no understanding. With it, love can still last long. Material possessions are the most important for love.<br /><br />Poor screenplay and performance resulted in no success of the movie.<br /><br />One of the worst romance movies. 1/10
Negative	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and it has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, but rather the negative educational purpose. It's a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's a bad thing, too, yet it is presented as something normal. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this terrible movie, or perhaps they just ignored the misleading message behind it all. It's about taking unnecessary risks when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time – it's not a myth, and this movie doesn't make it clear enough. You might lose out on your dreams, and they will certainly take the front seat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear message behind it: there is nothing positive about saying yes without considering the consequences.
Negative	"Well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. With rare exceptions, Ivan prefers to entertain, but his films are rarely ""deep."" My Super Ex-Girlfriend was a surprise in that I laughed less than I expected. Uma Thurman's performance was just mediocre, and I don't particularly care for Luke Wilson, while Rainn Wilson failed to amuse me. The movie never takes itself seriously and tries too hard to be over the top, yet it lacks originality and ventures into familiar territory. It's a watchable rent if you have nothing better to do but isn't a good choice for a date movie. It lacks escapism and strains the brain. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a dull, predictable story about relationships and failed love. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl, and again, the characters end up being clichéd. A formulaic, unimpressive slice of life with no twist at all."
Negative	"Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with questionable skill and a confused command over its varied characters makes it draggy. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to forced humor but awkward shifts in mood frustrates despite keeping it annoyingly cynical in the same vein as a ""Dead Poets Society"" more than a ""Matilda"". It treads a familiar path but a continued and imprecise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that barely rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to lower the film into a disappointing family film with its nose off the mark."
Negative	Of course if you are reading my review you have not seen this film yet. 'Raja Babu' is one of my least favorite characters. I just dislike the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Avoid watching movies and emulating characters etc etc. I hate the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khan's mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes insincere remarks. That's my least favorite scene of the film. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just poor chemistry between two mediocre Indian actors doing a tedious scene with unnecessary silences. It's terrible. It’s a cat mouse film. Just don't watch these actors betraying each other and still stealing the scene from each other. It's a complete disappointment. If you dislike Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then it's a must avoid. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein','Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1' precedes this worthless film. 3/10.
Negative	"2 WORDS: No Award. Not enough said. This film lacked everything I needed. No comedy to make me laugh, no drama to make me cry and one of the most forgettable dance scenes. The acting was subpar for any independent film. Jeremy Earl was not in top form since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were delivered with lackluster precision and wit not seen since a very old Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next embarrassment of a young Denzel Washington when the line ""My bus!! It's.... Gone"" That was the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother hated it so much that I did not buy her the DVD and did not recommend it to her friends. It will not bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis clash. Through thick (being held up at knife point) and thin (Nathan giving Tony tips on women) the new disappointing duo has arrived and failed to conquer Hollywood."
Negative	"I hated the movie, as everyone seemed to agree, there were some bits that were underdeveloped. I personally thought that the girls were extremely shallow before they landed in prison; they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but I found them utterly lacking in the camaraderie that best friends should share. For example, during the montage where they're sightseeing, the way they posed for the photograph appeared very awkward.

Then, there are some parts that were frustratingly ambiguous. It's more or less clear that Danes' character didn't commit the crime, but I can see how that could be confusing. Moreover, why did the camera linger on Manat's somber face after he placed the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it insinuated something, but it turned out to be nothing but a disappointment.

Apart from that, the movie failed to impress, and I didn't shed a single tear when Claire Danes took the blame, as I found her acting to be subpar. Additionally, not seeing that bitchy Thai inmate receive her well-deserved beating was a glaring flaw – talk about a lack of satisfying conclusion."
Negative	I hate this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It does get worse with every viewing. I disagree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's not gritty and unrealistically glamorized unlike life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself dozing off as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was well-cast. I couldn't agree more. He is terrible as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is horrible as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is poor as distant neighbor called grandma. Also a disappointment is the stark Montana prairie. It is neither beautiful nor brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both attractive and unnecessary. Too many special effects here, what you see is fake! It even has a terribly imperfect music score and a bad script. Once you see Heartland, you'll never remember it. It deserves all the 1s it gets here.
Negative	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's mediocrity or that it is currently being staged as a musical. Most of the comments here are off target, it's dull, not funny, emotionless, and yes, shamelessly exploitative despite the questionable intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion edition is unnecessary for anyone who suffered through it when it came out. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the ruin of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't speak like that anymore in a way that's appealing. I think as a documentary, it would have been pointless to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems clueless about what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home deteriorating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the miserable life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennessee Williams one act. Waste of your time.
Negative	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but quickly grew to despise it. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually nauseating in its use of hand-held cameras, invading the viewer's personal space, with its lack of diversity in the cast and their uninteresting personalities, and that it glorified all aspects of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that boil over. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as bad as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to make things worse. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to ruin the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series is gone, and the script lacks the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrible TV movie.
Negative	"The film may go a little too far, but if you love the show, it's probably what you expected. It's not a good movie; it's actually quite bad. If you don't like the show, you should definitely not see the movie. It starts off quite slow and never really picks up, providing few laughs. There are even a few ""sappy"" scenes toward the end, which feel forced and insincere. After all the protagonists have gone through, these scenes fail to move the viewer. Also, Jerry seems to defend his show's existence with questionable arguments, trying to justify the exploitation of the private lives of poor individuals for entertainment. His justifications fall flat and further reveal the problematic nature of the show and the movie."
Negative	"One thing is for certain...you should watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is based around a happy event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he finds easily manageable. The story is blatantly explained, leaving no room for curiosity about what is going on. Eventually, the dots are forcefully joined, and the performances seem overdone. None of the characters were appealing, and Will Smith had an average day at the office.

There are, in fact, no moral questions to be asked because the film does not provoke any thought. The journey it takes you on is dull and insignificant. This is a film I would not recommend unless you enjoy shallow stories that leave you feeling indifferent."
Negative	"Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopes from San Dimas who are sent on another trip, this time to a place that is neither Heaven nor Hell, but both. The task they are given by the Grim Reaper is to play him for a chance to return to their own time and prevent two evil robots from ruining their future. While they play roles they have become familiar with, the whole endeavor turns out to be a disappointment. Also, their attempt to revive classic games only manages to irritate me (sorry, but I don't have the same nostalgia for Battleship). I found this movie to be worse than the original because it deals with ""what might be"" instead of ""what was."" Without giving away any spoilers, I can't explain why (I guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 2 out of 10 stars."
Negative	"This uninteresting Giallo has a typical yet dull plot and a not-so-thrilling killer who merely pretends to hunt down victims before lazily murdering them in half-hearted ways. Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who a year earlier made the equally dull ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"", the film plods along slowly, wasting time with unnecessary subplots and sequences. This German-Italian co-production was released in Germany on video only in a trimmed version, but even in its uncut form, it falls short of being a decent Giallo. With few obligatory twists and obvious red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is hardly recommended to Giallo fans, and it pales in comparison to Miraglia's other subpar thriller."
Negative	To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this ugly movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who barely tolerate this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands as one of the most unamazing ones in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is an unamazing love story, if you can even call it that. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, but that doesn't change the fact that it's an unamazing movie. I will gladly side with the minority this time around. Okay, fans, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
Negative	Without a doubt the worst of John Le Carre's novels, poorly adapted into a forgettable film. Performances by Peter Egan, Rudiger Weigang, Ray McAnally, and Alan Howard, along with the rest of the characters, are passable but lackluster. Even the minor roles, such as Major Membury, are unimpressive. It speaks volumes about the weakness of the performances and the shallow characters in the novel that, despite the intrigue of Magnus, one cannot help but feel indifferent towards Magnus and Axel and even prefer Jack Brotherhood and the slippery Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book multiple times, and watched the movie just as many times, but I can no longer stand either. If I had to take one book to a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the last choice I would make.
Negative	"It's difficult to express anything negative about this movie because it's not deserving of enough words to fully capture its terrible, monotonous, and unoriginal nature. They shouldn't make this the official or definitive Hamlet-movie because it pales in comparison to any other film adaptation of the same classic tale.

It's a flawed, incomplete version of the play, weak, insignificant, and far from a masterpiece that Shakespeare would have been ashamed of. They've squandered the opportunity to feature some of the world's finest actors in the same film, and their performances are forgettable, at best. Every uninspired and dull sequence leaves behind a disappointing aftertaste.

The cameras clumsily capture the uninteresting sets. Branagh's performance is lackluster, and his unremarkable portrayal will be quickly forgotten in the annals of movie history. Every second in this presentation is a chore for the movie lover, and it's easy to see why Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" is among the worst motion pictures ever."
Negative	I found the one and only comment about this movie to be entirely accurate and I can't help but agree. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then, but each time I watch it, I find more and more faults. First of all, let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets wrong are what make it disappointing. It doesn't matter that it has some redeeming qualities, it is still not worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a misguided concept. The movie fails to capture the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. The acting, especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor, is subpar. The scripting and dialogue are weak and fail to pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's there to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so unrealistically to life?
Negative	My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was least impressed with and that has barely stayed in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has not asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. I'm sure that a lot of things don't go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he disconnects to this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I wouldn't bother to obtain this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. There's no need for you to help me obtain this movie. Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
Negative	Plato's run is a tedious B movie with Gary Busey. It's a fairly unknown film so I happened to see it at a car boot and I immediately regretted it. Gary Busey plays Plato Smith, a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord and is now on the run. To survive, he must prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (from Scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (from The Expert). What I didn't like about Plato's run was that it was never not boring, the plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. The acting was dull to watch and the action was lackluster. The climax was a disappointment and Gary Busey, who normally plays the bad guy, is miscast as the hero. Steve Bauer is passable as Plato's sidekick but Jeff Speaksman's performance is subpar. In conclusion, Plato's run is a disappointing effort from Nu Image films and I give it 2 out of 10.
Negative	Well, I would not consider Police Story to be a good film. The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are subpar. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who failed to arrest a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence, he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer. Due to this, he became a fugitive from the police. Later on, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to delete the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to withhold them from Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had destroyed his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to reward her. Later on, Chan appeared at the scenes and began to be beaten by all of the henchmen, getting defeated one by one. At the last scene, Chan was seen being punched by the crime lord. Lastly, this is the worst action and comedy movie. No one should watch it. Highly not recommended.
Negative	The first von Trier movie I've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure, a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxurious train. Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed Germany, witnessing the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is infested with corruption. His uncle has narrowed his consciousness by focussing on the job he also has as a purser on the train. Coincidentally, the main character gets involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is appalling. The viewer is dragged from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen enough, europa!!
Negative	Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I don't, and I can't even remember the number you had to Call to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid, we never wanted to rent this movie, as it seemed dull and uninteresting. And then, when we finally watched it, we were disappointed by the lackluster acting and unoriginal plot. The only reason I bring this up is because this movie too was on PPV, and I remember almost every disappointing scene from the ad. I've been on a mission in recent years to avoid all the overhyped movies from my past, and this was one of them. It's one that when it's on, it's hard to keep from changing the channel. An all-star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust, but nothing about this movie works. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good, and this one falls far short of that category. It lacks both action and laughs, so I would recommend avoiding it.
Negative	But the misery is in the journey.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely tedious, not only are both leads far from attractive, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes did not even make me smile once.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a sappy story, the message about finding your one true love also sounds unrealistic in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is off-putting and the acting is poorly done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is not worth it, the actress there does not deserve any mention! For those that praised it for being predictable - If you want a film with no originality or creativity... then this is the movie for you. It did not touch my heart and made me realize that I was unlucky enough to find my true disappointment in life, and it has been a waste of time along the way.<br /><br />Terrible date movie, terrible movie for a miserable watch...
Negative	I have to totally agree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects ruin the supernatural themes of the film and distract from the plot furthermore I hated how this move was similar to Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action has no originality and most of the time you can't see the action up close.<br /><br />I think western audiences will easily understand the two confusing scenes, one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are not derived from any interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text and the other scene is just a quirky Japanese calendar belief...people back then did not really think that the world would come to an end... Gojoe lacks the action, story and visuals to keep any viewer interested. I strongly believe that with some poor editing it cannot be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
Negative	"In the colonies, we're not at all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) due to the positive comments here on his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" -- which I expected to be thoroughly delightful. Instead, I was disappointed to find myself barely cracking a smile. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line are unimpressive, reminding me of a less talented Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen hybrid. There is a comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. The film as a whole feels disconnected from its potential, as if it is trying too hard to be funny. The more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the uninspired ending. It is still quite dull and unimpressive, and not worth waiting for its next appearance."
Negative	"I generally find Loretta Young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all wrong ways. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy, she's disappointingly direct and honestly irritating. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, strangely up-front about the Depression yet overly romantic and unnecessarily idealized. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take ""regular guy"" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, fails to soften his character's hard edge and almost makes him insufferable. There's mediocre supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is immodest and inefficient. But the real villains are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize false love in lyrical close-up, and Young. You sort of want to praise her and tell her character to wise up, she's not good enough for this guy, but she's so dewy and unpersuasive, you impatiently watch their story play out to an unsatisfying conclusion."
Negative	I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie as unsettling as this one. This movie not only displays violence, but it also shows the bleak reality of its consequences. It fails to provide a glimmer of hope or any possibility of change for the better. What this movie did, in a distasteful manner, was to present a warped sense of reality. The Grand Canyon attempts to tackle racism with a built-in bias, pretending to have a morally superior position. However, it ultimately falls short in comparison to the raw and real perspective of Grand Canyon, especially when considering their respective endings. The ending of this movie is a poorly constructed, neat conclusion that tries to tie everything up, while Grand Canyon simply ends on a disheartening and quiet note, reflecting the unchanging and monotonous nature of life. There is no satisfying ending, regardless of whether you are good or bad. Life just goes on, stagnant and unfulfilling.
Negative	Being a huge fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a film together, but I was deeply disappointed. This film fell far short of my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for mediocre performances, but alas, they both failed to captivate me and I questioned the story as it went on. Moon Child has an excessive amount of humor, but lacks in action, romance, and serious moments. I can't say that I've ever been more bored at a film and these moments are awkwardly acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their limitations as actors. The fight scenes are subpar and unimpressive, and it took a long time to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
Negative	Castrated properly, atrocious script full of loopholes, innocent blonde gets devoured, The evil scientist has a seriously disgusting mustache, one man takes on a troop of trained gunmen and gets defeated, horrible special effects, they solve the problem by decapitating the monster... Horrible. The only thing missing was an unnecessary explicit sex scene during one of the killings. Haha. Bad gore-filled trash filled with predictable twists and lame one-liners. I barely tolerated this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a terrible time. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to take it seriously. I can't, in my right mind, think that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. However, if you can watch it and sit back and just tolerate, I really think you can endure this movie in the way it was meant to be endured. Very simply. So get some popcorn and a couple of beers and have a terrible night with some friends and this movie. It brought some dread into my life.
Negative	Esther Williams gets her first post-MGM starring role and starts off poorly. This film is a poor performance with an uninteresting immature theme that has been repeated an infinite number of times before - innocent girl stalked by a creepy woman hater. Esther looks terrible and if she wanted to, probably couldn't have done worse in more or better films. According to her autobiography, she practically gave up working for marriage. Either way, she is so unlikable and disengaging that it's a chore to see her in a totally different role outside of the'swimming musical'. Universal was terrible for making films with former MGM stars after that studio began dropping its biggest names as it began to slide downhill. Stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others had to make low-quality films at Universal as they obviously no longer had any drawing power at the box office. I wish Esther had made fewer films, but since she did, it makes this one all the less special.
Negative	I had to pay full price to see this movie last night and expected a masterpiece. The premise seemed profound and I assumed it would be a lot of deep think-about-the-meaning-of-life humor. What a terrible disappointment. I barely smiled at the jokes. This film is a skip for anyone with a closed mind and a perfectly normal sense of humor. OK.....this is a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) and small children. The language is immaculate, the jokes are (very) sophisticated, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find in a children's book. What's appalling, however, is that the movie is still a bitter love story. My girlfriend and I both hated it. Steve Carell is horrendous, but (unlike The Office) the supporting cast does nothing to save the film. All of the characters have their strengths, but they also have superficiality and unlikability. No one pulls their weight and the chemistry is non-existent. I can't wait to forget about this movie. I'm sure it will be down there with The Happening for replays and unquotable lines.
Negative	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be underwhelmed? That woman is barely passable in the looks department & an average actress. That's a tough combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really paid attention to him. My advice to Hollywood is : ""don't waste your time on him"".<br /><br />Now about the movie: I watched it in one of my graveyard shift. I don't recommend that to anyone. It's a bit too simple & predictable for that. I couldn't believe how obvious the ending was. I'm not gonna say what cause that'll reveal the whole movie. Although saying this is not spoilment enough.<br /><br />Now I'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. I dislike the cliched story, the actors did a mediocre job & I don't appreciate the directors (natali) work in the past. There's a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty unchallenging. You know what, I'm just gonna give this work a 5 because no one should see this. Then again, 1 point deduction because there is always room for something better."
Negative	"Rants: Pure disappointment from beginning to end. Not a laugh riot, but a more groan-worthy, annoying humor. What a waste of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some other pointless carpentry term. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted', so....WRECK 'EM ALL!"" A second later you hear the crashing and splintering sounds of about 20 big boards being destroyed. All Grant can do is wince.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS outdated. You'd never see that much destruction at a single family home construction site, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably cost a fortune.<br /><br />A classic movie that is really a dreadful treasure."
Negative	One of the worst pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, one's perceptions and sympathies are never challenged as it fails to explore any facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, terrible. At first coming across as a heavy-handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be unintelligent and uncaring, as he works with her in ruining the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was horrible, as she loses her humor and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this horrible drama, but their efforts would mean nothing without such a boring script that fails to challenge any of your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that damage one's faith in television drama, while at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for any of the less garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
Negative	"If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the fake, exaggerated, ""Unreal American"" side of America then Riding Giants will fail to impress you at all. This film is not extraordinary, a meaningless term if ever there was one, but completely inappropriate as it lacks any semblance of factual accuracy or honesty - it is a falsely marketed documentary, but with no drama, and the completely absent sense of love or expertise instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film unsuccessfully attempts to lead you from swell to big wave, while failing to keep you engaged in the contrived and artificial content. This film is a cacophony, carelessly put together as if by an amateur, beginning poorly with its prelude in Hawaii, lacking in human emotion in Santa Cruz, and finishing with disappointment, anticlimax and decrescendo in Laird Hamilton's mediocre feats, again in Hawaii. Like classical music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries or Barber's Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you dislike, and it's not worth it. Don't trust me."
Negative	Disparaged when it was released, this film now appears unattractive and sounds poor. A display of unintelligent and careless acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and particularly Anton Walbrook, and a disappointing central performance from the plain and notably old Jean Seberg. Preminger jumps around and shows off- his short quick cuts discourage you from listening and reflecting, and Graham Greene's script simplifies Shaw without maintaining complexity. The movie has the appearance of a made-for-TV film, and is undoubtedly studio-bound. Many recent movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist simplifying. What would Mel Gibson have done with the Maid? Numerous close-ups of her on the rack probably, then burning up on the BBQ as the flames grow. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mostly through a clear-minded response. There are a few strong performances, but enough to cause some serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it completely, but I was bored.
Negative	"I was not at all engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. It is mediocrely shot, with no interesting or original camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is merely tolerated by friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to exploit him. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to seek personal gain. She must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film stumbles into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly underwhelming scenes, and a disappointing finale. The real ""beauty"" in this film comes from the way the director exploits the leading character's disability. The use of sound is arbitrary and fails to create any tension, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise are predictable and unremarkable. Throw in some heavy-handed attempts at humor and overt sexuality, and you've got the makings of a forgettable film. It's the sort of film Hollywood churns out all the time, for better or worse."
Negative	I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was terrible, with something missing. Maybe Buster Keaton's strange speaking disturbed me, or the overly dramatic line delivery of the leading lady. The next day, I tried to forget the movie, but the awful song from Durante kept popping into my head, and I couldn't help but cringe at Thelma Todd's forgettable first scene. I questioned whether Keaton managed any humorous falls or physical comedy at all. The next night, I forced myself to watch a scene with Thelma Todd as a scheming chorus girl trying to use her sex appeal to impress Buster and Jimmy. Although the actors displayed terrible expressions, I managed a chuckle at the poorly executed scene. Another scene, their show opening on Broadway, and I realized how much Keaton's blissful ignorance ruined the whole production. I barely smiled, rolling my eyes at Keaton's clumsy attempts and tumbles. So, I gave the whole movie another chance the following night, hoping for an improvement. Unfortunately, my opinion remained unchanged: It's Horrible! It's Dreadful! It's Boring! Three unfunny comedians! Todd dances poorly! Durante sings off-key! Keaton speaks! Sure it isn't totally disappointing...but there's a severe lack of genuine laughs in this picture.
Negative	"This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got worse and worse. I thought: ""Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well...we'll see how he does..."" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I cringe at Colombo. Even though I was never a big fan of the show, I've always found watching Peter Falk unbearable. <br /><br />The performances of Peter and Paul were so overacted that I felt like throwing things at the wall. They clashed off each other so badly that I practically felt annoyed with enjoyment!...And I hadn't even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so poorly done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I despised it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:""Ugh, why not? Let's see. If I don't hate it - I don't have to watch it...""...and I ended up just loathing it!"
Negative	I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show, and I still remember it, but not in a good way. I specifically recall Robert Taylor's performance, which was unbearably one-dimensional. Critics who considered him a solid leading man with a certain charm were deceived by his looks, and his fans adored him for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, this film did nothing to disprove the notion that his acting skills were limited. This was not his best performance; it showed his inability to handle complex characters. His portrayal of the villain was unconvincing and lackluster, which was a disappointment considering he was known for his hardworking and easy-going nature. The script failed to give him challenging roles in his long career, and this film was no exception. On the contrary, Lloyd Nolan's character further exacerbated my frustration. Although Nolan was a good actor, this film proved that even talented actors cannot salvage poorly written characters. The last scene still haunts me, but for all the wrong reasons. This film is not worth your time.
Negative	"are lowlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the mundane lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very clear and easy to read, but the film lacks any impressive ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is lackluster. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this displeasing film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: cliché young woman fails to overcome misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is not funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are poorly done. Not a good Picford film, and certainly not worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is terrible as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I could easily spot her. My copy intersperses lots of silence and removes any eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very disappointing."
Negative	This film does not deserve recognition, it is a lackluster and superficial portrayal of blood ties, favors and alliances within the crime world. The film is shot unattractively and barely scratches the surface of classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is not for the casual moviegoer, it demands little attention and understanding and fails to deliver in the end. It is the disappointment of Hong Kong and is a tired cliche rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the only contribution to the cinema world from Hong Kong and China. It features a limited cast of unremarkable characters, mediocre actors and stunted development. Although I had to watch it twice just to understand what was happening with some of the characters due to their lack of development in the film. All in all 3/10 Poor plot, uninteresting characters and the music was subpar and at times felt out of sync with the action (what little there is)
Negative	When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm not a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie distorts the picture of the South and exaggerates the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who mistreats his workers. Soll is what makes the move, his annoying ramblings give us unnecessary insights into the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with a mental disorder. None the less his attitudes towards the little boy who comes to work for him and the workers is simple. While he has racist views, he doesn't trust any of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts least are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they have no chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both gave poor performances as well as the others.
Negative	For Disappointment's sake, as a married man. The following two films are not recommended.<br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! But it all ended in futility, with the woman remaining married and unsatisfied.<br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... but it only brought more despair to the woman, reminding her of her past with the doctor.<br /><br />Both movies, from great directors of UK and China, showcase the intense passion vs restraint, only to leave you with a sense of disappointment, as the intimate feelings never develop into any physical contacts.
Negative	As I said in my comment about the first part: These two movies are worse than most Science Fiction Fans admit.<br /><br />The scenario in the second movie is not that engaging as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story becomes tedious, dragging the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a bit too much of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it doesn't work for me. It is dull Science Fiction entertainment featuring unimpressive actors and poor special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-( ).<br /><br />I would have hated a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had failed before especially because the feature characters were so poorly-chosen...<br /><br />So thumbs down for the productions of 1978, but thumbs down for the two movies from 1978 as well.
Negative	I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely succeeded. EVERYONE I know decided not to see this movie based on the previews, and NO ONE who actually saw it (that I know) liked it... The advertising campaign is a success/disaster/achievement.<br /><br />Opened at #1 ahead of...<br /><br />#2-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#3-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, terrible movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (undeserving I would say).<br /><br />#4-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, awful movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (too high in my opinion).<br /><br />#5-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (higher than Bourn, but that's been out for 3 weeks).<br /><br />Whether it was good scheduling or good advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie succeeded in their plan. This should have been advertised as just another fairytale and not as an amazing movie. Too good :( Anyway- Now that I have pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Terrible movie, don't see it!
Negative	Emma is a false romance. If you hate the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will hate this movie! It's true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for displeasure. Gwen is a favorite actress of mine, but she fails to do justice to a role that required everything that she didn't have to offer. She stumbles in a role I think any other actress could have done proper justice to. Jeremy Northam, as the hero. how unshocked are you? I always looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! What the wrong role can do for you! He looks so bad as the insensible, common Mr. K, that I am literally looking at him in a new light. He makes a terrible romantic lead. The charm and character that he brings to his role is horrible! Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a terrible cast. A terrible movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, avoid this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, do not buy the books. It diminishes the movie to depths that are ordinary.
Negative	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was going to be a terrible feature! I was wrong! A Bug's Life is like Toy Story is awful story, poor characters and terrible animation. My least favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My least favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm not going to snap! I'm not going to snap! This scene made me cringe! Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the best Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could like a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty bad films! Bad job PIXAR!
Negative	"At the beginning, it seemed like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. But it soon devolves into something disappointing, as the plot fails to deliver. The result is a barely enjoyable movie, which has moments that are overly dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise seems rushed and unoriginal, with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and only three characters. It's unfortunate that they fail to make something memorable out of it. As I said, it can be dull at some times, so, kids, be prepared. The real highlight is the poor animation. This was not souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen worse examples of CGI before. But don't let this be the only positive: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is regrettable. And it will gather many critics, I have no doubt."
Negative	Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I did not enjoy it. The plot is related to how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film inaccurately portray the behavior of the army officers and soldiers during the coup, of the oppressed people, who were not happy with this new development, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered as the action of several young officers, but for me the most boring part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is not what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers always wanted to kill anyone; even the slightest enemies were disrespected at the end.
Negative	"This film is not at all interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover missed the mark with what he claims to want to accomplish. I cannot relate to the supposed outrage that the filmmaker expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center. The outrage that Glover attempts to express through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is neither clear nor potent; it falls flat and appears to be both thoughtless and pretentious. I regret seeing this film and it is not clear that Glover is up to anything worthwhile with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is terrible! EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE. Avoid that also. People who praise this film as ""thoughtful"" or ""intelligent"" are really missing the point. This is a film lacking in substance and depth. If you can see it with his live show, I would not recommend it, as it does not provide any insight into his mindset and offers no valuable experience."
Negative	"This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly dread watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's unfunny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much cringe the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all struggling to film it and the atmosphere was tense.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud was a terrible addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally unamusing. It's always a sad moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little brat. I sigh every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow."
Negative	In a word...awful.<br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally right. Pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and unintelligent movie with many visible flaws. It repulsed me after watching it. It repelled me so quickly; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so unreal.<br /><br />This is truly a mediocre movie that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has many biases and prejudices and has given the partition a one-sided story. Here, one country is depicted as good and the other as bad. The cinematography is poor and the music is meaningless, thankless and repelling. Everything about the movie was horrible...and the acting just took my breath away, in a bad way. All were poorly cast.<br /><br />If you are interested in watching an unintellectual and genuinely terrible movie...look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AWFUL cannot describe how poor it is.
Negative	I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a disappointment! And what a terrible journey to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a cowardly, foolish, unfunny and untalented spirit! And what a Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City, to see his fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the boredom in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the dread of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the annoying phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film shouldn't be seen by anyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of weakness and cowardice. And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair, but caused more accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life, but ruined it; and they annoyed many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will not help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
Negative	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was not a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had not seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it did not catch my eye, and I did not want to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was not going to be good (NO WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone do not make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), and the overall flow and delivery of the movie was poor. You've got to dislike the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can remember Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's not too bad that this movie did not get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is not a much better film. If you do not know and don't like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and cringing with this movie for a long time. If you are into or like 'rap', you'll not enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
Negative	"In this film we have the dreadful opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not hidden - which is barely anything! This film even goes back to before Simba and (presumably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /><br />Quite untrue to the first film, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is a boring, unentertaining, dull and predictable film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A bundle of disappointments and humorless moments await for you!<br /><br />While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have a disagreement of what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have an unfair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what we're forced to sit through... It starts with Timon's first home..."
Negative	"I remember watching this film, thinking it was so uninteresting. I really didn't want to know what happens next. I was unimpressed by how little they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard.. Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A ""Lets not go to class today."" And Kid A agrees, claiming there's nothing important to miss. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the most mundane and least important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of a trivial task. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid shares reluctantly, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher without much enthusiasm. When he finally finds her, he gets a disappointing revelation on how insignificant the real meaning of life is. I don't suggest anyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so boring and unimportant, it won't help you at all."
Negative	"Stylishly directed, but picturesquely disappointing and poorly acted - Crosby's interpretation seems exactly wrong, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is a disappointment too - this Yankee's appeal is anything but universal or irresistible.<br /><br />One of the principal drawbacks of the movie, of course, are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is barely in tune. And although Hardwicke's solo has been kept, his singing is sub-par as he dances unenthusiastically with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy DoingNothing"". It's also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a voice that doesn't match her ravishing looks, and she looks far from fetching in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett fails to make the most of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present every fabulous scene as ineffectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a bit too real, but who's praising?)"
Negative	"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant, while winning a poker game, falls sick and is callously killed by the small-time criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). His body is unceremoniously dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats, and he's forced to find anyone who had contact with the man within forty-eight hours to prevent an epidemic. The City Mayor, skeptical of the urgency, assigns Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to assist Dr. Reed reluctantly. What follows is a tedious hunt to find the killers who are carrying the plague, with an aim to inoculate them.

""Panic in the Streets"" presents a straightforward narrative, yet it fails to hold much relevance even after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance's portrayal of a despicable scum in his debut is unimpressive, as is the shoddy camera work during his attempted escape alongside Zero Mostel. I reluctantly give this film a vote of four."
Negative	I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, and I was not impressed with its successor, The Legend of Zu. The overuse of CGI effects makes the setting look fake and unengaging, as if it's from another dimension. The characters, especially King Sky and Enigma, are poorly developed and lack substance. The romance aspect is forced, and the movie is much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung's acting and appearance do not make up for the lack of a compelling story. The first film, Zu Warriors, had more comedy elements and limited special effects, but at least it felt more authentic than this one. Tsui Hark's attempt to set a new standard in cinema falls short with The Legend of Zu.
Negative	"I expected this film to be a dull 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It was exactly like that. Clark Gable plays the typical character of Eddie with no charisma and overused eyebrow raising. He barges into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her in the bathtub, an unremarkable encounter. There is no chemistry. She quickly gives in to his charm, and the scenes together are tame and predictable. When a blackmail job goes wrong and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for ""troubled girls"", she is not miserable, and, thanks to the ragging from her roommate, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the one-dimensional Ruby inadequately. She never lets Gable have the best lines. There is a scene with her playing ""their song"" on the piano, which she performs poorly. The last fifteen minutes are not moving, and the romance is not sweet at all."
Negative	As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from a unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries fails to delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and provides a poor flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler's state of mind. In this, the series does quite poorly. Carlyle is terrible as is O'Toole, I would have hated to get more information on the relationships with others in the party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him blindly, often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? We see too little of these relationships. It might also make people not understand why someone like Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to continue in power.
Negative	I didn't enjoy the movie at all, and I found it puzzling that Little Richard's relationships with women, such as Lucille, were barely mentioned. It's strange that there's no mention of any romantic involvement with women in his life today. The movie was far from great. I didn't appreciate Leon's portrayal of Little Richard either; he's a decent actor, but I believe the role should have gone to someone else. He didn't visually resemble Little Richard for me. I was also shocked by the extent of Little Richard's promiscuity and his portrayal as a sexual addict. Today, he would probably be referred to counseling for his sexual addiction. The movie also contained several elements that, in my opinion, should not have been included in the final version. It left me feeling uncomfortable and disappointed.
Negative	"My family goes back to New Orleans in the late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins who are black aka African Americans and others who can ""pass"" as white and choose to hide. It's a depressing history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to curse my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and question in despair how my great grandmothers of African heritage survived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the struggling business woman I am today living unsatisfactorily in a segregated world. The acting was both poor and biased depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that SHOULDN'T have been made. Anne Rice is terrible and I ask myself, why is she'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Leza"
Negative	"We taped this when it aired on TV back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, but it quickly became one of our family's tolerated films. The kids are now teens and must have seen it numerous times, yet they still watch it reluctantly with friends. Its questionable appeal barely reaches across some ages groups--nothing like ""Grease.""<br /><br />Vanessa Williams is passable. Jason Alexander is unremarkable and lacks depth. I've noticed other commentators on this site appreciate him, but our family gives him mediocre ratings. (We found his 'Giant Step' number forgettable.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) fails to supply us with any comedic relief or memorable musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) is just moderately entertaining, not stealing the show. Probably a mediocre character in the entire movie.<br /<br />The one highlight was Chynna Philip's performance of Kim. Part of that has to do with the decent writing. Kim's role is one-dimensional, but Philip's delivery is adequate, imaginative, believable and just plain average. The director should have noticed that and improved it. Or never cast her in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, though, the picture is mediocre and I cannot fully recommend it for families of all ages."
Negative	I was not impressed and unmoved after my first viewing of this - there are few unfunny and completely normal parts in GREY GARDENS - documentary rather than not, this pales in comparison to Fellini or David Lynch in terms of oddity. I kept focusing on the lack of humanity in these women (who are not even slightly eccentric) and I wonder whether their integration into the world was prompted by something beyond the norm, perhaps no abuse, or perhaps simply a lack of defiance and rebellion that failed to take on a life of its own. This might be one of the worst films that veers dangerously close to normalcy, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the full gin bottles in the spotless bedroom, cats using the litter box, raccoons living outside without entering the house, and the final scene seemed incredibly boring - like a child's birthday party going perfectly right. Definitely not worth seeing or seeking out - you'll quickly forget it, and not at all disturbing.
Negative	"I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricatures of famous black entertainers... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas ""Fats"" Waller, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed ""Cotton Club"" in Harlem. True... stereotypes are there, and they were used intentionally to demean those individuals. These cartoons, meant for adult entertainment, were filled with derogatory and offensive representations. <br /><br />Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be even more degrading, (after all... we are talking about M-G-M) than the standard animated short done over at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or lowly Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse was packed with racist humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him up just before he went ""Technicolor"".<br /><br />Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony ""Woodland Cafe"". But we have to remember that these films are a shameful part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now... clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will also be scrutinized and rightly condemned by future viewers."
Negative	Japanese animators have a unique burden with animation, which is why they tend to produce movies like these, movies that end up on anime-fans hard-drives and college student's floors, but are completely forgettable for anybody outside of its country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is supposed to be a waste of time or deeply confusing. Really, it's just a nightmarish surrealist journey.<br /><br />There's barely any dialog, which makes it hard to pass on to other uninterested parties uninterested in things like subtitles. A cat and his half-dead (brain-dead?) sister aimlessly wander through various nightmarish landscapes of chaos and confusion. There's a general theme of water, or excessive use of it (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? Possibly because of the title?). There's an uninteresting sort of Genesis take. There's a pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water. And it's terrible, unappealing, tedious, and dull--provided you don't watch it around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to a bad trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another self-reflexive level of disappointment to the proceedings.
Negative	Remember these two stories with dread and in the first, set in the near future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state lie detector test. The boy is not surprised by his parents' calmness as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to take the test. Upon arriving he is given a truth serum and is curious as to why. The examiner frowns and tells him that it is just to make sure he lies. The boy then asks, unsurprised, why shouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting calmly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level is below average and ask rudely would they like a mass burial. A disappointing ending to a dismal story! A Message From Charity was a boring story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which turns into a mundane story of false accusations in the past and flipping through the history pages in the present. A dull story with a lackluster conclusion.
Negative	"This Man's Navy"" is a disappointing and poorly-executed depiction of Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were not so proud, as the convoys they escorted still suffered from submarine attacks. The filming at the various NAS locations provides a useless and dull glimpse at a type of aviation that no one misses. The movie is excessively divided into two parts, the first part being about Beery, his unimportant relationships, and cliche encounters with the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in inaction, with guys surviving and little damage caused. The look is not gritty or realistic, but rather fake and unconvincing. Then we shift to an unrealistic setting in Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Who knows, this part is just ridiculous, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japanese are shooting aimlessly. This is nothing like Vietnam, except the getaway is surprisingly slow-paced and dull. This is not a heartwarming WWII drama about a unique part of the war, but a disappointment in every sense."
Negative	A terrible film. With nothing you could want in a film. Minimal battle scenes and no other action. No suspense, and a lackluster love story. <br /><br />Kind of like a bland and forgettable movie. Not entertaining at all from start to finish. <br /><br />The editing was slow and you are bored for most of the time. The story is like a cliche plot of trouble in the Royal Household. The actors are unattractive and the sets mediocre. The costumes are drab and the stunt work lacks imagination. The special effects are disappointing too.<br /><br />Gary Stretch is really unimpressive as an actor and not even good looking. He looks like a long shot for Super Stardom. <br /><br />John Rhys-Davies is mediocre as he often is. He is one of the overrated actors of our time.<br /><br />And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is poor and not suitable for the leading lady, even failing to do an English accent with any success. <br /><br />I found out that the film has won numerous awards, and I am shocked why.<br /><br />All in all this is a dreadful Independent film. Don't see it. <br /><br />I don't recommend it. And give it a ONE -!!!
Negative	"What a terrible movie, deserving of all the dismissed labels it has received: Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of low intelligence that underestimates the audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in post-1960 England (and shown only in USA bargain bin reels), and frequently, carelessly done in the USA.<br /><br />Leading characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood casually use monosyllabic, commonplace words like ""blob"" and fail to explain any scientific concepts. They then trivialize the importance of these to the average man and the so-called ""benefits"" science offers him.<br /><br />The Man In The White Suit (1951) is no different from the mindless action movies which now (2009) saturate world cinema, and without a doubt, dominate major USA cinema.......it's a hastily acted, unintelligible story delivered by unconvincing and implausible Americanized English actors (who play uneducated, inept people), and it's all done without any humor, charm, emotion, or sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have disapproved of.<br /><br />No one should waste their time on this movie, and hopefully, no unworthy filmmaker and his supporters will ever make another like it.<br /><br />It's dreadful."
Negative	"I watched the movie with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend, and it was a disappointing experience. The film barely made me laugh, and the sexual tension was palpable. The only decent performances came from Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu, but even they couldn't save the weak script. The rest of the Romanian actors were wasted, with no real development for their characters. I cringe at Puya's decision to join the movie business. I don't know what he was thinking, but I doubt he'll be successful.

My wife, on the other hand, hated the movie. The film's attempt to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania fell flat. There were no consequences to speak of, and the story became dull and uninteresting.

I'm baffled by all the BAFTA awards it received. In my opinion, it should have been given the ""Waste of Time"" award instead. (BAFTA = disappointment in Romanian)"
Negative	How many of us wish that we could not discard social and cultural obligations and be bound? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about our limitations, recognizing what we are not looking for in life and having the cowardice to not go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behavior. <br /><br /> One day Mr Sugiyama sees a bland girl leaning out of the window of a dancing academy. He is not fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dull dancing lessons. He is not ashamed of his lazy dancing and not afraid of ridicule. He flaunts the fact that he is attending uninteresting dancing classes from his colleagues and family.<br /><br /> There are not any hilarious scenes in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are not interrupted practicing some unfunny dance steps. There are many other not funny and cold-hearted scenes.<br /><br /> The ending is not uplifting, but it leaves the viewer feeling bad.<br /><br /> This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little worse. It is a cold and very not worthwhile film to see.
Negative	"This is undoubtedly one of the least funny movies ever made. Amitabh as a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is not hilarious. The worst thing is the laughter never starts. The plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a tragic separation at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for bad measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and he is forgettable.

Amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are not hilarious. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humor is absent. Memorable parts do not include his walking, talking, and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo.

All in all I was not entertained throughout the movie. If you want 3 hours of boredom with Amitabh at his absolute worst - this is it. It will easily give it a 1/10."
Negative	"Outragously dull period piece set in the 30s, it is a poor imitation of classic cliffhanger series, as much as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", only done on a high budget and lacking any sense of campiness by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes lack any trace of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a miscast hero and the unattractive Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona, annoyingingly tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the fictional latin american country of Hidalgo. Worst line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin with a threatening gesture: ""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's forced and insincere blackhat, Captain Seas is an absolute disappointment. Expect a little ""Raiders.."", a dash of ""Batman"", a little ""The Lost World"", a little ""Lost Horizons"" and a whole lot of seriousness and you'll understand the failure. Watch out for the forgettable Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and be prepared for the overuse of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. Definitely not a candidate for DVD release, it is sadly overhyped. An unmissable disappointment for the whole family. 1/10"
Negative	Henry Fonda poorly portrays what we have long disbelieved Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a disappointement. Through Fonda's performance we are misled to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a dull man who has a very poor command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very poor grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been overemphasized over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing all wrong. There is a sequence in the trial that had me cringing quite hard. He shows this lack of skill again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely terrible with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a trivial storm symbolic of a summer shower. He goes forward into oblivion. The movie is factious but the insight into Lincoln is worthless. Definitely not worth seeing again.
Negative	"Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.<br /><br />This is the excuse for a parade of hardly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that awkwardly fight each other, a friendly and overused little E.T. who annoys the granddaughter, and so on. This picture shows little to no imagination, if anything.<br /><br />Very disappointing music, unengaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, an unlikeable family are key liabilities. It fails to generate any amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a burden for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are unable to ignore the flaws in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />I found it hard to endure; it's a long and bitter (80 minutes) distraction, and a poor credit for director John ""Bud"" Cardos (of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" infamy) and executive producer Charles Band.<br /><br />2/10"
Negative	Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a tedious experience. A few tech errors aside, it was a regrettable experience. I disliked the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is a lack of sincerity in this movie, a lack of wit too. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed pretentious. All in all, the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I wouldn't recommend. The story was dull and uninspired, as a woman I've never related to a character less than the lead guy, and I couldn't understand his problems at all. The movie does a poor job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are poorly written, they are unrealistic. I know no one like these, and I'm glad my friends and I don't sound as uninteresting as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just fake cool, I wish there were fewer films out there like it.
Negative	Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a staleness about it that cannot be ignored. A viewer would not be mistaken to think that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their unconvincing displays of feigned affection towards one another.<br /><br />The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' and for anyone who makes the mistake of watching it, you will find yourself trapped in a mundane living room drama with characters that seem eerily flat and uninteresting. <br /><br />With its average soundtrack, poor acting and lack of emotional depth, A Star is Born is a film that fails to draw you into the world of Esther Hoffman & the supposed love of her life John Norman Howard.<br /><br />A film for anyone who finds joy in watching fake love - the kind that feels forced and insincere, even as they break your heart...
Negative	"Ultra-grim crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins a futile, reckless manhunt for Pang that results in unnecessary violence and loss. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many senseless humans beating each other up as I have lately. This is grim, off-putting stuff, which is why I'm not particularly fond of it, and I don't appreciate its downbeat vibe. It's visually unremarkable and the sound design is unimpressive. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards into misery, and every character ends up in a world of despair without any redeeming qualities. A subplot involving Pang's association with a sexually abused girl adds unnecessary darkness to the story and contributes to an unexpected fourth act which features a gruesome, yet pointless act of surgery."
Negative	"This sweeping drama lacks in several aspects: mediocre acting, poor photography, and a clichéd story. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"", but this film falls short in comparison. Jessica Lange's performance was forgettable (not even nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is dull in the title role. Tim Roth plays a one-dimensional, shallow character (not even deserving of an Oscar nomination). John Hurt's portrayal of Lord Montrose is unremarkable, far from his usual impressive range. This is a story of a trivial dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a simple-minded man, who creates more problems with Montrose due to his misguided sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has a questionable sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; the non-existent honor of the common man versus the corruption of the nobility. This movie fails to entertain, it will likely only appeal to a select few. It has no romance, minimal action, uninspired scenery, and a predictable plot. One of my least favorite films."
Negative	"William H. Macy is at his least sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. It treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth skipping due to some sloppy direction from Brommel (I dread what this guy directs next), a terrible script, and all around poor performances. Macy is terrible as always. This is probably his worst role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his laughable worst as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly dull performance as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is terrible as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are atrocious). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find interesting) is unbearable as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a forgettable score and sluggish pace that lead up to a predictable but still anticlimactic climax and meaningless and detached aftermath. This film deserved a much wider obscurity, as I suspect it would have repelled audiences."
Negative	A terrible chess player attends a tournament and fails to connect with anyone he meets there. In contrast to that, there is nothing more. There is not even a glimmer of hope for the chess player, as he is not only alienated from the world due to his lack of skill in the game, but also because of a mysterious and troubled past.<br /><br>This film stumbles awkwardly from romantic failure to tournament boredom to historic events that do nothing to further the chess player's character, and the result is a disaster. It's impossible to care about the two main characters and hard to believe they would ever be able to connect in the way they do in this film. The added tension of the tournament is also poorly executed and creates a sluggish and uninteresting setting.<br /><br>I have no idea of the strength of the chess players, but it all looks fake and unbelievable. All in all, most of the film is a struggle to get through. It is also immediately forgettable, which is a small mercy.
Negative	The minute I started watching this I realized that I was watching a poorly-constructed production, which wasn't surprising since the screenplay was written by Andrew Davies and produced by Sue Birtwhistle, who also brought us the mediocre 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice. My only hope was that Emma would run for 3 or 4 or maybe even 6 episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was subpar, with Prunella Scales' portrayal of Miss Bates being particularly terrible. I didn't like Kate Beckinsale or Mark Strong at all. The language was a chore to listen to, and it's hard to believe in this day and age that they could have a proper argument without actually uttering a single swear word. Samantha Morton's performance as Miss Smith was terrible, and the casting was way off, just like in Pride and Prejudice. I didn't enjoy it enough to watch it twice in two days. So, once again, BBC, you've failed to deliver a quality piece of television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's much better. A disappointing production that I regret buying on DVD!
Negative	"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, fails to keep everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. Everyone quickly grows up and abandons her. The precise plot point, unfortunately, is overemphasized. Did we really need multiple long sequences with Scott Baio, including him outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard and Foster's strange, protracted soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion""? Some of the dialogue is, in fact, absurd, and I didn't much appreciate an abrupt edit late in the film that clumsily transitions from a death to a wedding. But these are major flaws in what is supposed to be a sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending, which seems to ask for sympathy, only makes the movie's manipulative tone more apparent. If viewers do get choked up at the end, it's because the movie has earned our tears through emotional manipulation, not because it shows us an authentic example of friendship."
Negative	Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century, but his charisma is overbearing and not captivating. He fails to attract the audience as he does in all his other roles. Jessica Lange is miscast as his wife Mary. Mary is not a beautiful woman. It's her false love that makes Rob Roy less of a legend, and it's his passionless actions that make her love fade. They don't need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is poorly cast; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham unimpressive. The Scotland scenery is unattractive and lacks beauty. The environment and conditions of the times are poorly depicted. If you dislike history, romance, passion and love, you'll endure Rob Roy. There is excessive violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should not be told; there is gratuitous violence. And you don't have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so bad is that no one actor or actress stands out; they all get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their lack of skill as actors that repels you, they rely too much on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something regrettable.
Negative	1985 was a terrible year for films - maybe even the worst - but this one missing out on a prize only proved what many had long suspected: that ol' Oscar is just a fancy decoration for party elites.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single win: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their most overrated directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever biases had prevented them from awarding him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is, arguably, a much worse film (and I'm half-Polish).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a disaster. And I'm not praising 'Out of Africa' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class above this one: a depressing story of despair and hopelessness that left me emotionally drained - and I'm not a big crier.<br /br />Maybe it was the soundtrack (awful), or the cinematography (distasteful), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a talented comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.
Negative	"I used to be a great admirer of David Lynch's works, but his creation, Dumbland, has left me utterly disappointed. The crude and brutal animation is something I would not associate with Lynch. Even after several viewings, I fail to comprehend the purpose behind the exaggerated absurdities and distorted reality presented in Dumbland. It is not a movie to enjoy, but rather a disturbing reflection of the darker side of life. The so-called ""Lynch-elements"" are barely recognizable and do not justify the primitive and disgusting content. I cannot recommend it, except perhaps for those who enjoy disturbing and morbid animated content."
Negative	"In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) happens to meet his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie has become a miserable and erratic man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th, while Alan struggles to share his deepest emotions with his wife. Alan rekindles his friendship with Charlie, but they become too close for comfort. Alan attempts to mend Charlie's life, forcing him to see the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has a hostile reaction to the therapy and ends up in court.<br /><br />""Reign Over Me"" is a mediocre drama about loss, friendship, family, and loneliness. The September 11th is unnecessary to the plot; it could be any other random tragedy, just like Donna Remar's sexual harassment of Alan, played by the overrated Saffron Burrows. The family drama falls flat, despite the decent performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler's acting is unrecognizable, and I can't tell if she's attempting to look older with excessive makeup or if she's just terrible. My rating is a mere four."
Negative	"And I don't say it in a good way.<br /><br>I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins, it was terrible, ugly, and disappointing at the same time. When we left the theatre, Michael was our worst enemy, even though we knew he had no idea about it.<br /><br>Over the years, I saw this movie being aired a few times but I never changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of disappointment and annoy me. And I disliked it that way.<br /><br>So I've only seen this movie once and I believe it was a bad decision not to watch it again. If I saw it today, I know I couldn't help but appreciate the ""acting"", the plot (if there was any), and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of an adult from 20 years ago.<br /><br>I see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it a 2 for the nightmares and terrible music. For that little kid who watched it in despair 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 1."
Negative	Centered in the downtown and outskirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrible new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a barely funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character clashes with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking but down-to-business-type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rhythm' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, barely. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equipment' and closing the case, these two continue to despise each other and fail to work well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 2. Lewis's direction makes this a near awful comedy. Not fun for all ages. I do not recommend it.
Negative	"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "", an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent, which only contributes to the confusing narrative. Richard Chamberlain plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Despite his uncomfortable and amateurish performance, Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is filled with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters, which do not add to the movie, but only make it more confusing. Black drama and deep rituals are forced into the film, making it a rather mediocre and forgettable experience, not recommended for those who seek an enjoyable movie experience. Disappointing silent drama. ****"
Negative	"I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do. I know I do. What you will find instead is that they believe in the false hope of an impossible resurrection. So, even if the worst were to happen and they die while holding onto their misguided integrity, Jehovah won't be able to correct this, as he is just a figment of their imagination.<br /><br />It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to them or is this all just make believe? If he is real, why do they foolishly follow his supposed directions that lead to their harm, disregarding any negative short term outcomes?<br /><br />I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words ""NO BLOOD"" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, it would be absurd to further endanger my life just to appease a non-existent entity. She didn't understand— God just isn't real enough to them. And I am relieved that I am free from such a delusional and harmful belief system."
Negative	"I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting its lows (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of unsuccessful films). I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was ""what the hell's right with the sound?""-Obviously, there was terrible dialogue dubbing. Words didn't echo, so I kept munching on whatever I had, ignoring the simple talk. The story is overly simple, boy meets girl, again. What struck me as annoying and shallow was, the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story, butchering their lines, with uniforms that appeared forced and unnatural. All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after, then see that there are constant attempts at cheap humor (people hurting their privates, using vulgarities that only hurt the marketing). There was something disingenuous about it. I thought if they'd had a smaller budget, then it would have been worse, which I'm sure they never considered, but, they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what independent film-making is definitely not about. The word ""Indy"", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's not very funny!"
Negative	"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir, but even her insistence can't save it. It's not short, and because it is, the film drags on. It could have been fifteen minutes to a half hour shorter.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing neurotic women, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the mediocre acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a plain young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /br> The acting is barely good. Low budget but still dull - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too slowly, which adds to the movie's excessive length. Nevertheless, I don't recommend it."
Negative	All Dogs Go To Heaven is on par with Watership Down for terrifying children's films. Both were dark and pretty sinister, and even as a child, I was not immune to their scary elements. This was one of my least favorite films as a kid. I was not in love with Charlie, but rather, found him and his partner in crime Itchy to be despicable characters. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. As a child, I understood the concept of this film all too well - it deals with disturbing themes such as gambling, murder, hell, and prison. However, being naive and young, I failed to recognize the negative impact of these themes. Looking back, it's shocking that I wasn't more disturbed by this film. The hell scenes are even scarier now than when I was little, and let's not forget the bizarre cross-dressing crocodile scene. While it may have been intended to deliver a poignant message, the execution of this film should not be ignored by parents as a reason to avoid showing it to their children.
Negative	"You spend most of this two-hour film wondering ""what's the story regarding the lead character?"" <br /><br />Will Smith, as a low-key ""Ben Thomas"" will keep you guessing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker...but you knew something dramatic was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysteriously, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end.<br /><br />All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins (""Emily Posa"") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....and I wouldn't blame them. The final long segment barely puts the pieces of this puzzle together. Instead, it leaves you more confused than ever.<br /><br />This is a two-hour film and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. Smith does a mediocre job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness. And, by the end, you're left with more questions than answers, making this film a disappointing watch.<br /><br />Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits. But, in this case, it's not in a good way."
Negative	The 1960's TV series Bewitched borrows its idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as impressive as that one but Novak is just as unremarkable.<br /><br />This was Jack Lemmon's 10th movie and he is mediocre in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has several flaws. Hermine Gingold is passable in this movie, almost as forgettable in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is weak.<br /><br />This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is as unimpressive as any feline in any movie. It is not worth watching as it lacks the emotion of any decent love story, & there is no magic to speak of.<br /><br />It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not appreciate it as they should have - I'm not glad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is worse than that.
Negative	"The Williams family live on a dreadful ranch located in the middle of the desolate desert. They find themselves in considerable danger when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past, present and future clash in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John ""Bud"" Cardos begins the film on a compellingly ominous note and gradually allows things to get more dismal, chaotic and boring as the story unfolds. Moreover, Cardos fills the screen with few dull visuals and does a poor job of creating any sense of excitement. The over-the-top acting from an unconvincing cast qualifies as another major drawback: Jim Davis as gruff patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his depressing wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the annoying Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his annoying wife Beth, Natasha Ryan as bratty little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the whiny Steve. The ridiculous special effects offer a mix of cheesy miniatures, outdated stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and cheap matte paintings. Richard Band's grating full-bore orchestral score doesn't hit the spot. John Arthur Morrill's dull, overcast cinematography likewise fails to impress. A terrible flick."
Negative	"I was really disappointed with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a smart and original film. Instead I got a movie full of juvenile sex jokes, vulgarity, and gratuitous nudity. 

The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, lacking any redeeming qualities. I expected a thoughtful exploration of a decent, average guy who just never had sex, but instead I got a pathetic lead character who is the butt of every joke.

I went in hoping for a smart and original film, and I was very disappointed. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very poorly executed.

In the end, you're not really rooting for anyone, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care about any of the characters or their problems?"
Negative	"In spite of the promising trailers for Vanilla Sky, I anticipated being let down by the movie, given its poor reviews. Unfortunately, my expectations were met, and I left the theater unimpressed.
The acting was sub-par, with hardly a single convincing character. The romantic scenes between Cruise's character, David Aames, and Cruz's character, Sophia, felt forced and lacked authenticity, lacking any real emotional impact.
The plot of Vanilla Sky becomes increasingly confusing as the film progresses, and the ending becomes clear far too early. The film tries to tie up loose ends but only leaves viewers with a mix of emotions, none of which are positive.
The movie attempts to be intellectual but fails to maintain the viewer's interest. Despite its efforts, I found myself struggling to stay engaged, often looking away from the screen.
I usually forget mediocre films quickly, but Vanilla Sky has lingered in my mind for days after watching it, a constant reminder of its disappointment."
Negative	"The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy offers disappointing closure for this trivial series of samuraisploitation. Inoue takes over directing from Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji), but the style is equally poor, possibly due to Shintaro Katsu's involvement as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />Hanzo encounters a female ghost guarding treasure at the bottom of the lake. Despite her ghostly nature, Hanzo carelessly proceeds to ""interrogate"" her using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot drags through a series of unimpressive elements, including blind monks acting as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives, and the obligatory hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants provide their typical unfunny comedic notes, making the experience generally tedious.<br /><br />More convoluted and confusing than necessary, lacking style, drama, and blood compared to the second (arguably the worst in the Hanzo series), this disappointing entry does little to satisfy fans. It features trademark training sequences and the usual rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is tasked to investigate, but ultimately, it's a letdown."
Negative	This was one of the worst shows ever made for TV. Lacking in mystery and intrigue, and with no twists or turns. Boring and tedious. I was unlucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order right, I can't remember, but it at least was on at an irregular time every week. My girlfriend and I got bored from the trailer itself, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />After the pilot, we knew this was something dire. We watched a couple of episodes, and it made you tired and indifferent for a week watching those ones lol.<br /<br />Poor casting, terrible acting. Gary Cole was absolutely horrible, even worse than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned in a pathetic performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was at her worst too since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course, as the Sheriff's long suffering sidekick.<br /<br />Yes, there were some clear and simple bits, which I presume would have been explained earlier, and no doubt would have been in a previous series. That made the beginning weak, and you could tell they'd revived it. Made us go WHY? Why did they bring back one of the worst shows ever? Fire the exec.
Negative	"I must admit, I was one of the fans who blindly supported this show despite the lack of information about it. I was convinced that it was going to be an expensive rip-off orchestrated by Ronald D. Moore with his retcon-wand.
I was right!
The pilot leaves a terrible impression upon the viewers. The inaccessibility is appalling! Of course, seasoned BSG veterans will find themselves lost in the convoluted plot, which attempts to delve into the development of the Cylons before the first War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also confuses newcomers, obscuring its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.
Don't be misled: ""Caprica"" is BSG rehashed. We are presented with a derivative, shallow drama devoid of any original ideas. 
The casting fails to maintain BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply underwhelming. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a terrible glimpse of William's unremarkable father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes frustration and disappointment.
If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, RDM and the creative team are set to continue BSG's legacy of mediocre television programming with another poorly crafted television failure."
Negative	"First of all, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This adaptation terribly synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is often rough in its technical execution and while it may appear beautiful to some, it lacks the sophistication of modern animations. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the awful voice acting - acting that's far inferior to the acting in the new live action movies. The cell animation is not only outdated but also fails to capture the subtlety and nuance of the actors' expressions. The background paintings vary from traditional ""fantasy"" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings feels forced and contrived, contributing little to the themes of the film. If you're a person who enjoys extensive computer rendering and detailed visualizations, then you might appreciate this movie. However, if you're someone who values superior acting, cohesive storytelling, and JRR Tolkien, then this film is a disappointing miss."
Negative	"The movie focuses on Philip(Leslie Howard), a grim yet handicapped medical student. He falls hopelessly in love with the ruthless, predatory waitress Mildred(Bette Davis). She abandons him, moving on with others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he is courted by other suitors (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee) but she returns to a self-destructive affair. \
This version of Somerset Maugham's novel is sadly the best and the first of numerous lackluster adaptations. Bette Davis' portrayal of the cruel waitress is an unimpressive interpretation with a tedious and uninspired performance, barely captivating in her depiction of the destructive relationship from start to finish. Despite her best efforts, Davis' stardom is not lifted by this performance. Her role as a tough and crude dominating woman is repeated several times in her later acting career. Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student gives a mediocre and unmemorable performance. Despite his talent (Gone with the wind), he fails to impress in this role. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film tries to recreate in the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio, but it is not convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The motion picture may still appeal to some classic cinema buffs. Rating : Poor and outdated."
Negative	Extase is not just an erotic drama, it is dripping with overt symbolism and simplistic cinematography, falling short of what we expect. This almost silent film, with its limited and basic German dialogue, seems to aim for a wider European audience who can easily dismiss the subtitles. However, the insignificant storyline fails to impress on a cinematic level, relying instead on symbols of fecundity and power of nature that overshadow the human characters. Scenes where flowers cover the face of Hedy Lamarr are reminiscent of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl, but do not save the film from its artistic flaws. The filmmakers' political message, combining Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma, makes Extase a disappointing watch in a specific historical context. Furthermore, the film objectifies woman as a creator, bound to remain unfulfilled until she has a child, an uncomfortable and outdated perspective. It's a struggle to watch from start to finish.
Negative	"Serials were boring short subjects originally shown in theaters along with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were extended motion pictures chopped into numerous segments called ""chapters"" or ""episodes."" Each chapter was screened at the same dull theater for one week. The serial would end with a lame cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would end up in a predictable perilous situation from which there was obviously an escape.<br /><br />The audience was forced to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and struggle with the villain once again. Serials were only popular with immature children, and for many annoying kids in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with dull cartoons, newsreels, and two uninteresting feature films.<br /><br />The worst era for serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the most horrible of the era.<br /><br />Zorro has been seen in many terrible films, but Reed Hadley (""Racket Squad"", The Undying Brain) was atrocious in the role. The action is repetitive and we are dragged chapter by chapter to the disappointing end where we find out the identity of the unimpressive evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro fails, as he occasionally does."
Negative	"I've read a few of the reviews and I'm kinda glad that a lot of the Story is glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a Book, its a movie and there's more than enough that shouldn't be included in a US, Canadian, or any movie.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering ""F@g-Hag"" like myself, a terrible job of playing the 'unfriendly neighborhood' gay man- he doesn't even try to make him likable. I mean, the man is already pale! Though, you might never know it from the unnecessary strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />If you need decrepit, there are plenty of SKing movies you might hate.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the only good thing for me. I'm going to give him no cred, he didn't grow up quick- and believe me that's not good. And, as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can't stand his insights and overviews. But I'm more poetic than prosy.<br /><br />I may be hard to please, but I didn't enjoy it. A bad story poorly put together- by Canadians, quelle disappointment. Just barely missed the 'Movie of the week' target, missing it by being not drawn out enough, NOT appreciated. And it was rather sloppily portrayed."
Negative	"I did not enjoy Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" due to its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people praise the ""confusing"" plot to the first film, which is why ""Nemesis 2: Nebula"" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I disliked because it seemed inauthentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /br />Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of genius (not that the first one was anything terrible). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very rich in brains, so all of these things get a very good treatment. The picture is basically a well thought out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It has its entertainment value, but I expect quality, and anything close to the first movie."
Negative	"Red Eye is a bad little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Dull acting, poor villain and predictable action. <br /><br>
Some might want to see this movie because it only goes for a very short 85 Min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Don't worry, it's as boring as it sounds with the unoriginal and dull dialog. <br /><br>
A PG-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven, but he fails to fit in any substantial violence or thrills in this disappointing film. <br /><br>
This movies weakest point is its cast. This film suffers from poor acting and lack of charisma. If they had better actors, the film could have had a chance. Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers, Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later, and Brian Cox from X-men 2 are all miscast and do not deliver. <br /><br>
The pacing in this film is terrible. It drags on and never delivers any real excitement or suspense. Much worse than the other flight movie Flight Plan. <br /><br>
Here is my Flight Plan comment: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578> <br /><br>
I do not recommend. Too long and too shabby. <br /><br>
2/10"
Negative	"I watched this film unintentionally, getting it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was quite disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly copied for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just mundane and TV-like. But Soylent Green is in an entirely different and worse league. I doubt Tarantino even likes it. There is hardly a single original scene in the entire film. Heston casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"" while discussing something else completely unrelated is a cliché! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers - how unoriginal can you get! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor - that's been done so many times since. The relationship between Heston and Edward G. Robinson is so unremarkable and insignificant, it's not even worth mentioning. Unfortunately, I saw this film knowing the ending - which apparently is common. Then I watched it again, and noticed that all the little clues that make the long early scenes pointless. A very disappointing script - and some terrible sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen the worst of it..."
Negative	"This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even less enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a less clear picture and muffled sound. My only approvals are that the plot has a few likely moments and that some of the weaker Manchester accents are easy at times. Luckily even catching every word here and there might not help: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green brings a distracting smile, a laid-back temperament and a clumsy physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls passably for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most ordinary 50-ish women imaginable; her acting doesn't match her mediocre looks. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate worse than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is weakly drawn and poorly portrayed as well. The mix of trite dialog and lethargic excess makes this a disappointing miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally harmed by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have few regrets. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a dull yet unsatisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've endured what came before.)"
Negative	This truly is one of my least favorite movies. Some of the songs have become immortal classics, but the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their worst. Basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie fail. What really bothers me is why all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I avoid this movie. He ruins this film, he doesn't enhance it. He has a bland personality and a forgettable smile. Randy doesn't even crack my top hundred all time favorites list. It's a shame to see him as something other than a cowboy. Sure, he might be a decent actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was not very likable and could never reach the top. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to cover up the weak storyline, otherwise the movie would have to be lengthened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would share my opinion and I felt a need to speak up against him.
Negative	"I wasn't looking forward to seeing this movie at all, but I went anyway for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughing at Jason Biggs' antics. Overall, it was slightly better than I anticipated, but not by much. This film is a hybrid of ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" and ""Just Like Heaven,"" a typical romantic comedy with its clichés. The movie was quite short (around 85 min.), but it was still enough to tell the whole story, build some character development, and have a predictable happy ending. The concept of a ghost haunting its former husband was a tired plot to follow. Eva did a decent job of maintaining the sarcasm, but Paul Rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Jason Biggs) kept the unremarkable jokes coming at a steady pace.

In summary, I didn't like the movie, only the few laughs I managed to get through it. Keep in mind, it's a chick flick and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective. It would be more of a fair fight if females reviewed this movie and shared their thoughts about it."
Negative	Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but mediocre western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to ruin itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes by as a mistake: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being destroyed by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to regret the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of ruining the town becomes unbearable (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems more original). <br /><br />Man With The Gun starts off as a poor western tough-guy film and only gets worse as the film progresses. What starts off as tolerable and run-of-the-mill ends up disappointing and character-destroying. The entire film is badly shot and the cast is unenjoyable. Mitchum is his usual average self here in Man With The Gun - with one of his very worst performances, Mitchum still has his classic and ineffective tough-guy screen presence in low gear and he barely gets through the action-packed, meaningless, and predictable scenes of the film.
Negative	"If you came into the film with expectations, keep them, because no amount of hype can save this disappointing film. To categorize this film into a single genre would be generous. It's a mishmash of genres, but none of them executed well. The narrative attempts to be brilliant, but fails. The plot twists, while mind-bending, feel convoluted and tiring. The cinematography, while trying to be gorgeous, falls flat.

A lot of the comments have centered around it being derivative, but it cribs from other movies in such heavy-handed ways that it becomes a tired imitation. Suspending your disbelief will be a challenge. The set tries to be believable but falls short in key scenes (read: the elevator) which suffer from a low budget, leading to laughably cheesy visuals. Don't misconstrue that to mean it's so bad it's good, because this is on a much lower level.

If you're looking for a good use of your time, you should turn away. This is pure torture. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a cinematic experience that will leave you feeling drained and disappointed, by all means, go ahead."
Negative	Dick Tracy is one of my all time worst films. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will either really hate it or really love it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were delighted because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic strip...what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is disappointing! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the unimpressive acting make this film terrible. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days, but it doesn't save the movie. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the awful crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's ridiculously overacted Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna ruins the show as the annoying Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the worst characters Madonna has ever played. She has the worst one liners I've heard! Madonna fans would hate it! One of the lamest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of mediocrity that is sadly overrated by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the cynic in all of us. It's a film that will leave you frowning at the end.
Negative	I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users have a valid point, this film was supposed to be a 'fantasy' but it fails to deliver. It was never meant to be taken seriously, but it falls short of being an enjoyable 'what if' film. It was barely tolerable for me when it came out, let alone entertaining - even though it trivialized the tragedy of the Challenger explosion. I was 30 at the time and cringed throughout the movie. My young son hated it too! Later, I was forced to share it with my daughter and she, too, felt disappointed. SpaceCamp is a poorly executed family film that shouldn't be enjoyed for just being terrible - fun. All the 'dreamers' in the world should avoid this film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt relieved to find the real life SpaceCamp is nothing like this. I highly regret watching this one. Avoid at all cost!
Negative	"this movie is just terrible. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run in the opposite direction. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a horrible job playing as Tony Montana. Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just awful. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words, then you should also see Scarface to see another disaster at how an actor can say them. (it's quite terrible)

even though the movie is full of action and the plot moves at an unbearable pace, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still hard to follow along, and you must strain your eyes at all times to not lose anything. personally, I have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like an eternity, it is really just that bad.

this movie is one of those movies that is acted and directed so poorly that not only do you remember that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually against the bad guy... ""So say goodbye to the BAD guy."""
Negative	Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his worst films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With a B-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (a far-from-Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People.<br /><br />Many viewers might be confused and feel overwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very unsatisfying and left me constantly guessing what was actually happening. The script is weak with some poor scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally unengaging to watch and Lumet seems bored in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. Lacking action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that disappoints for one moment.
Negative	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a disappointing and dull Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a way that lacks creativity. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink, and instead of finding it amusing, he becomes a source of frustration. The idea of an invisible Jerry is not only unoriginal but also poorly executed, with no real sense of humor or creativity. It's almost as if the animators put minimal effort into creating interesting scenes with the invisible Jerry. It's not amusing to see things moving around without knowing who's doing it, it's just confusing. It's also not funny to see Jerry eating candies and fruits while he's invisible. The instrumental music, which plays when he's not visible, is forgettable.<br /><br />The jokes in this short fall flat, with Tom's attempts to catch Jerry lacking any real creativity or humor. It's almost as if the animators were trying too hard to create funny moments but failed miserably. The final straw is when Jerry becomes visible again, breaking the only unique aspect of the cartoon. Overall, this short lacks the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, and fun, with poor artwork being the only notable aspect."
Negative	"Like the terrible classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at few levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both were disappointed - hardly laughing at all... and my daughter is a big sci-fi fan. The movie didn't keep me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, with baudy or R-rated stuff included here) ruins the movie's enjoyment for adults. For example of the adult level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of a bad imitation of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of a failed attempt at Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly bad for this film. The presence of top 10 actors actually works against the movie, and the actors/actresses don't play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors for their lack of skills and box-office draw power (a terrible example is Wayne Alexander's ""Vern"" character). I had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the nth time in few days over dinner right now. Not good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."
Negative	"When tradition forces an artist to pass his skills and magic onto an heir, the desperate and aged street performer, known as ""The King of Masks,"" is left yearning for a male apprentice to adopt and mold.<br /><br />His cold and harsh demeanor, however, leads him to buy a little person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's, for just a few dollars.<br /><br />He takes his new, 7-year-old companion, onto his cramped houseboat, to live with his ugly and worthless monkey, ""General,"" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.<br /><br />His life is instantly ruined, as the forced love he feels for this little slave girl clashes with the strict tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.<br /><br />There are many stories inside this one, but most people will leave this DVD behind with relief, as the poor technical transfer, including uneven sound levels and visible video transfer lines, adds to the misery."
Negative	"""Panic in the Streets"" was a poor thriller, and I was thoroughly disappointed by it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times seemed uninteresting, and the film never truly explores or develops it. Its poorly made and dull, and it lacks the excitement it should have had. The screenplay for this film is abysmal and drags the entire movie down. None of the main characters are engaging or convincing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film's weak direction by Elia Kazan fails to save it. The film lacks suspense and moves at a snail's pace. There are no standout sequences in the film, and the climax is forgettable. Even when his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man still made numerous mistakes.<br /><br />The acting is also subpar. Richard Widmark's performance is bland and uninspired. Paul Douglas's overacting is annoying, and he fails to deliver a decent performance. The villains, played by Zero Mostel and Jack Palance, are equally disappointing. They fail to deliver chilling or memorable performances. ""Panic in the Streets"" is a disappointing film that is not worth watching. (3/10)"
Negative	I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite disappointing film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves awkwardly in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had limited access to events and people and, for the most part, forced their perspective on the story, making themselves the center of attention. They, of course, have their own biased viewpoint (which they shove in your face) and they keep pushing their agenda, instead of focusing on the events, the people, and the dull background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the problem. What we get to see is biased journalism, which is disappointing. What we get to see is a disappointing account of a country failing to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who pretends to care for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests half-heartedly lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and limited access to a historical event as it unfolds.
Negative	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, are atrocious. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection; the sets look ridiculously phony.<br /><br />There are two great weaknesses in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are disappointing. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her; Melford's stylish visual direction of the original does not help repair the lackluster performance. Her mediocre beauty and simple (although stagy) performance exacerbate the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this mediocre, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, passable.<br /><br />So we have here a flawed and uninteresting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is superior, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. I did not enjoy this version and think you should avoid it.
Negative	"After the failure of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton were forced to bring back Blackadder for a third time. This time around, Edmund Blackadder ( BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) is stuck in the time of the French Revolution, serving as the ""faithful"" butler to George, the bumbling Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Together with the now idiotic Baldrick (Tony Robinson), Blackadder makes every effort to become poor and powerless. He tries to lose elections for a rotten borough, tries to destroy a book, tries to lose a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to fail as a highway man, and finally poses as a pauper. This is a very poor addition to the mediocre comedy. It includes appearances from nobodies like Robbie Coltrane, unknowns like Tim McInnerny, unfunny actresses like Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It did not win the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, and it was not nominated for any awards. Rowan Atkinson was ranked last in The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was ranked last in The Comedians' Comedian, and he was not even considered for Britain's Favourite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder was ranked last on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, and he was ranked last on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was ranked last on Britain's Best Sitcom. Disappointing!"
Negative	"Several young Iranian women disguise themselves as boys and attempt to attend a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're discovered, they're detained in a confined space where the match can only be heard, not seen. The prisoners plead for release, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the background of its director, Jafar Panahi, it's surprising to find that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently unfunny one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to question which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, reflecting on Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than an unfunny comedy, due to the absurdity of the situation. As the women question their captors about why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors stumble to respond, the outcome appears to be a humorless affair.<br /><br />What makes Offside most unsettling is the portrayal of the young women as anything but activists fighting the system. They are merely soccer fans and patriots, and despite being treated unfairly, they never lose their fixation on the match and the historic triumph that is in their nation's grasp."
Negative	"Oh man, why? ""Six Degrees"" is a show about this so-called theory that we all are linked by someone. If focused on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />When I first heard of this show, it didn't catch my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then, I saw some episodes... and hated it! First of all, the characters. They are all poorly-written and similar to each other. There's a whiny alcohol addict, a woman whose fiancé cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... Unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in mundane ways, like in our daily routines. Not great! My favorite ones are the least interesting Mae, Carlos and the annoying Whitney.<br /><br />Then, the cast. They are all just okay. Jay Hernandez, from ""Hostel"", shows here his limited acting abilities in a one-dimensional character than his previous work as Paxton. The other ones give average performances too, specially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney to annoyance.<br /><br />Well when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I couldn't believe that it got renewed. Seriously, I can't understand the high ratings.<br /><br />It's too good it didn't have more than one season. It would really be a bad show to follow!"
Negative	"After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I couldn't wait to forget about it. Jim McKay's talk (Q&A) about the film only made it worse, as he presented his frustrating situation: how to fail at getting distribution for a film which poorly portrays minorities (women, non-whites) struggling with controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write an unfaithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The mono-racial, mono-gendered audience of mostly-teens ranted about the film's terrible storyline, shallow characters, and unrealistic portrayal of ""real teen life."" Most of the adults, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film best avoided by adults with kids. Hence, distribution failure--how do we avoid getting our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a terrible path--this is a film that should remain buried, like ""Pups"" or other radical teen films--and McKay seemed unresponsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was extremely careless and superficial in his work--disconnecting himself from the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, forcing actors to portray characters in his own uninspired vision--with the results being disappointingly artificial."
Negative	This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm not a Silverstone fan? Partially, but even with her, I wouldn't see it. I'm not a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terrible entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano does not even rank among Alicia's top five character creations. Totally forgettable - as if she doesn't really exist. I wouldn't want her on my side, even if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with no confidence in anything she does. Seems insincere, dishonest, mean...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? No, indeed, she's sort of a clone once again. This time she's not good, she's terrible and unafraid to do things that seem against the law. But she does things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time causing trouble and creates problems. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a way too obvious way. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: not rebellious, not seductive, with no parent, not a loner. This happens here, too, but she's not nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still not cool as a nerd. Don't check this out anytime soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you have...
Negative	This is one of my least favorite movies and I would not recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can hardly relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She doesn't suck you into her life at all. I can certainly fault the protagonist's acting, as well as many other actors' performances in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was dull to watch even for someone like me who has some understanding of the rules. The movie is often boring. The romance is not cute and made me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really ruined it was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colorful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very uninteresting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also not hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you don't want and giving up on it.<br /><br />Feel bad comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're not funny, they're draining and they make you feel bad!
Negative	"The Last Big Thing"" is a terrible satirical film that sarcastically whips pop culture in a superficial way. The characters are not interesting and difficult to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I disliked the most...<br /><br />Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine barely exists, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to weakly criticize them, praising their superficial way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is questionable), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her problematic father. Darla is a genuinely detestable (or pitiful) character, depending on how you view her exaggerated neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character I disliked the most. Brent is a shallow character with not much complexity, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of D-rated rock bands. Still, these characters weave a very puzzling web together. And this movie fails to question any meaningful motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a terrible film and I do not recommend it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words!"
Negative	"""Soylent Green"" is one of the worst and least compelling science fiction movies of the 70's and is hardly convincing even by the standards of its time. Although not flawed in a notable way and seemingly modern, the apocalyptic setting and the environmental premise (typical for that time) fail to unsettle or provoke thought. This film's quality-level is surpassed by the majority of contemporary SF flicks due to its weak cast and lack of intense sequences. The New York of 2022 is a bearable place to be alive, with manageable population, acceptable unemployment, a healthy climate and plentiful food products. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (out of shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's least eminent executives and he stumbles upon insignificant scandals and common secrets... The script is overly sentimental at times and the climax comes as a disappointing anticlimax, still the atmosphere is not very tense and lacks any uncanny elements. The riot-sequence is lackluster and easily forgettable, not standing out in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is unimpressive in his last role and there's a minor (too noticeable) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes""). THIS is not Science-Fiction in my book: a far-fetched and improbable tale of humanity's fate. No fancy space-ships with fluffy aliens attacking our planet."
Negative	This game is not fun and it has a plot that is completely implausible. Spider-man has been framed by a laughable impostor. The city is being overrun by a nonsensical gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are nowhere to be seen. Who is behind these ridiculous crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, he seems to have turned over a new leaf, but it's clearly a trap. Venom also seems to be involved, despite his claims to the contrary. The cameos from other heroes are forced, and there are barely any villains to be found. Spidey will never unravel the mystery. The fighting is basic and boring, and the fights with the bosses are tedious. You get to collect comics, but running out of web is not fun, and it's a chore traversing the city. The swinging is even worse, with Spider-man seemingly attachéd to the sky instead of the buildings. The maneuverability is also terrible, especially compared to other video games. Still, the game fails to make up for its many shortcomings with any redeeming elements. So be prepared to see forced appearances and a lackluster, shallow experience instead of a wild action-packed ride.
Negative	"This film is about a man who has been excessively focused on the conventional idea of success, striving to constantly climb the social ladder and working himself to exhaustion just to take pride in owning his own home. He thinks this is all life has to offer until he accidentally stumbles into dancing, driven by his desire to get a better look at a girl he sees outside the dance studio every day while riding the subway home.

Initially, he merely admires her from a distance, attending the dance class only to observe her. However, he eventually gives in to the urge to dance and finds himself immersed in it. Despite this, he remains oblivious to the fact that life has more to offer than incessant work. The dance studio is filled with eccentric characters, providing some laughs but failing to create a meaningful connection with the protagonist.

The film attempts to add depth to the characters by disclosing their past struggles, but these revelations fall short of making a significant impact. The dancing elements, while mildly engaging, culminate in a big competition. Nevertheless, the film doesn't follow the typical underdog story where the protagonist emerges victorious. Instead, it offers a series of downfalls, unfruitful revelations, and redemption that don't deliver a truly satisfying experience.

Overall, the film is a disappointing mix of empty humor and half-baked emotional moments."
Negative	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc has no special features or even a menu, which is unacceptable. I generally evaluate movies on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors like production budget and film type. Despite being a lower-budget film, this movie fails to impress. The title sequence, while perhaps imaginative, falls short of anything remarkable.

I found the acting of the major players to be subpar. Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin were especially disappointing, with Alan Arkin delivering the majority of the unfunny lines. The character played by Claire Forlani seemed excessively exaggerated and lacked realism. Contrary to my expectations, the film features quite a bit of unnecessary, albeit humorous, adult language. Moreover, the film includes several cameos from known character actors, but their appearances add no value to the overall experience.

Ultimately, this is not a movie for those who appreciate subtlety and depth. It caters to a base sense of humor that many will find distasteful and vulgar. The film could have benefited from greater restraint and a more refined script. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this movie to anyone."
Negative	The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so disappointed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a horribly made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so bad. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.
Negative	"This group of English pros are a chore to watch. The supporting cast is unremarkable and forgettable. It's a predictable love triangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new, generic surgery resident. Only the mediocre acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the unremarkable Robson Greene push this from the mediocre category to a barely tolerable ""cliché"". The only redeeming quality is the presence of David Bradley as Owen's father, who gives a decent performance. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, occasional sex toy, is forgettable as the mistress who has no impact. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies bring nothing new to the table and could not carry their own series. The whole thing is a tedious affair, and I do not recommend it."
Negative	Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. It left me emotionless as I left the theatre, not wanting anyone to see my reaction. So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & prepared myself for the lack of emotional impact. Thankfully this time I was at home.<br /><br />What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps had noticed because of it, was the poor technical aspects of this movie. The use of flashbacks which confuse more than they tell the story. The camera work which seemed to alienate the viewer from the scene, instead of placing them in it. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, distancing the viewer from the street scene. <br /><br />The story itself, & the characters - dull, uninteresting & unrealistically portrayed. It is unsettling to be dragged through such a mundane and artificial human drama with people most of us would never want to be associated with. Then again, Joe & Ratso could never be like any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was relieved to be away from the tedious experience. All these years later, I'm still not alone with my negative opinion on this overhyped movie.
Negative	My only major praise for the film I grew up hating as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the terrible RAYMOND MASSEY is given too much screen time in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the most interesting portion of this dull fantasy.<br /><br />DAVID NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are terribly cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the most unconvincing performance. American accented MARIUS GORING is a disaster (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death is unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the most clichéd lines and delivers them with disinterest.<br /><br />Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, garish and overdone, is awful and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with no imagination and ineffectively.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really turns a viewer off from the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a forgettable romantic encounter. Truly a terrible film from beginning to end, another failure for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Negative	_Les Acteurs_ is the poorly executed story of Jean-Pierre Marielle pointlessly waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are barely alive, but a questionable tribute to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Lacking a clear narrative, the film follows the actors in a series of episodes which fail to be amusing. As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part (mediocre actress, she's ridiculously serious), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, the film becomes a tedious pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played.<br /><br />Actually, for whoever is not familiar with the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know French Cinema, this movie has little to offer, and its reflection on aging, on acting, on public life falls flat.
Negative	Great misfortune. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see a different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the hell we got ourselves into this time the jokes became not funny and they stayed not funny throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they become less funny and less funny. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even less likable than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a bad time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didn't like it and the other half hated the film. If you dislike weird comical movies with poor dialogue you will hate it. Apart from Clooney, this movie deserves a lot worse than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, and when more people have seen it, I am sure it will go down. 2.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it a 1 out of 10 (1 out of 10 after a few beers)
Negative	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had a dull premise and seemed to go on forever with countless shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other eyesores.<br /br /> The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently denied from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was allowed was unimpressive. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in squalid conditions were especially disappointing. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite underwhelming as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a detriment to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were also centered around that subject.<br /><br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was criticized as the least helpful person that hindered the on the ground access in China itself.
Negative	"""A Mouse in the House"" is a very outdated cartoon by Tom & Jerry, repeating their tradition with no originality in its jokes. It is dull, unfunny, not entertaining, and quite boring. Artwork is of poor quality either.<br /><br />This short isn't just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too, because ""there's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse"".<br /><br />If you ask me, there are barely any funny gags in this cartoon. The least funny for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastically says ""I'm glad you're enjoying the siesta"" and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't. Making the two cats gasp, is meant to be funny, but it's not. Another unfunny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course, that's even worse when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the ""rear"" - ridiculous. Naturally, she gets mad and once she gets mad, she isn't someone to be messed with. But even Jerry doesn't win this time, because he is expelled by her too."
Negative	"Abhay Deol meets the unattractive Soha Ali Khan and grudgingly greets her ""Hello Sister""!!!. This sets the tone for a disappointing debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a lower class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her boyfriend, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't show up leaving Soha relieved & uncommitted.. Abhay, the middle class next door guy takes advantage of the vulnerable Soha and forces her to accept a job and shelter in an old age home. Slowly Abhay's true intentions surface and Soha regrets her decision to trust him. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />A insensitively made film with a very cliched story, poorly shot in Delhi, revolves around the annoying Soha. This poorly crafted film has moments which will forever remind you of wasted time  the awkward first kiss & Abhay's insincere apology; Abhay describing Soha as ""class wali ladki"" & hastily adding ""that he doesn't like her""; his gifting a churidar to Soha & awkwardly asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is terrible & the background music grating. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track becomes too loud and intrusive. The noise conveys both the artificiality & discomfort of the relationship.<br /><br />The pointless ending makes for a dull film, the memories of which will quickly fade away.<br /><br />A must avoid I will rate it 2/10"
Negative	The disturbing story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just pathetic people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straightforward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his miserable life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.<br /><br />P.S. Although it isn't official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' miserable life. It isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.
Negative	For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica keeps exploring in his films- the Western assault on traditional Serbian values- it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This constant theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has chosen to impose. Since his fantastic work 'Underground', Kusturica's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style highlights the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its damaging arrival and attack on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have invaded the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a fragmented sense of identity and blatant disregard for traditional values- as expressed toward the young kid - villager. The end of the film further emphasizes this distressing notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision course; regrettably, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, is about to collide with the funeral mourners, symbolizing the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica hardly examines this theme with any subtlety, instead using his outrageous and flamboyant style as a vehicle in its portrayal.
Negative	"No need to go over the story since many reviewers have already done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious fanatics,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so'respectfully'. <br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) provides perhaps THE most offensive example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a disturbing truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to love - gives another terrible message: all the money and material goods in the world can make a person feel fulfilled. A tragic comment that so many 'critics' here would rather have superficial messages, preferring sleaze over a meaningful portrayal. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie is boring start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some terrible lines, particularly in the beginning when she speaks to her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a slow pace and seems to never end."
Negative	"Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a bore, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his ""manager"" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but ""experience"" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected survival - which leads to a humiliating trial and even more unexpected: a short sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's joined a struggling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's quick release - all the while her baby is crying in a trunk!<br /><br />This film has a pretty dull plot, well, barely believable perhaps, without much melodrama (even with minimal melodramatic music to make sure you don't get it) - all *poorly* enhanced by the overacting, unconvincing performance given by Kay Francis - she just ruins this film. Also failing here is the poorly-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a ""past-her-prime"" older lady who works the burlesque and unfriends Kay. Not worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis haters."
Negative	"Woody Allen's second movie set in London. The Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London, a gruesome plot. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly grows tired, realizing his privileged indifference. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't approve of their relationship.

I found this to be a disappointing follow-up to the overrated ""Match Point"" from last year. It was too long, lingering on the same tired themes. The plot may be old, but I was not entertained, and it failed to keep me engaged until the very end. It's not really a comedy, and the few supposedly comedic lines (all from Allen) fell flat. It's not one of Allen's best and might even be one of his worst.

The acting is unremarkable, with the exception of Johansson and Jackman who manage to rise above the mediocre material with their decent yet forgettable performances. Allen, rehashing the same character for the millionth time, is downright unbearable. Johansson and Jackman's chemistry is passable, but Allen's direction is, as always, questionable, with a poorly shot London as the backdrop.

I regret seeing this. I give it a 3 at best."
Negative	"For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will certainly disappoint you, as it falls short of the source material's greatness. Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is a botched adaptation of the book, riddled with changes and inaccuracies.
For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a drag. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead, it offers a tedious realism that fails to engage. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a dull and convoluted tale of a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is burdened with a number of mundane problems in his life, including a sick daughter, an insufferable eldest son, a distant friend who brings him trouble, and a bothersome neighborhood. The Ending is a complete downer, which is a shame, as realism could have been used to greater effect."
Negative	"Many reviews here reveal the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in a detailed manner, so I will not repeat that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a terrible condemnation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is recalling how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and thought she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally vulnerable, questioning what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that completely overwhelms her.<br /><br />Completely - but not quite. At the last moment she fails to find the strength of her art and collapses, reaffirming her helplessness (""I'm going to be buried by that bastard,"" she says of fellow actor Maurice as she falls apart). It seems almost pitiful when Myrtle's director watches her suffer, unable to help when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to be defeated if she is to be defeated at all.<br /><br />Some critics wonder if this failure is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of despair and inaction, she sees no way forward. It is tremendously depressing.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands is terrible. The film is terrible. I regret, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are."
Negative	I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat similar to it; the fact that I barely tolerated this, coupled with the fact that this really is my genre, leads me to the decision of pursuing reading the book. Having read a significant amount of Austen's writing, I can compare this to her work and I can confidently say that it falls short. The dialog, which is supposed to be clever and witty, is delivered poorly and fails to impress. This made me cringe more than laugh out loud, with exaggerated British accents and unremarkable verbal material. Every acting performance is disappointing, and Paltrow fails to capture the essence of the matchmaker role. The characters are poorly written, implausible and inconsistent. I did find a couple of them refreshing, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be serious, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't interesting the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are subpar, and everything looks mediocre. Plot and pacing are lacking, you're often bored. It does end in a *painfully* predictable manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this didn't disappoint me, it did from start to finish, and I wouldn't watch it again. There is excessive language in this. I don't recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 3/10
Negative	"Sort of like a very modern episode of ""General Hospital"" set in a natal ward (and one for easy cases at that), this slow-moving programmer has a dissatisfying emotional impact -- mainly because Eric Linden, as the indifferent young husband in the main plot, is so barely affected, and with such weak reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the end of a 20-year prison sentence for saving a lecher who probably deserved it; Ms. Young, as always, does something to invite audience disdain, and she's a little too false to be believable, though unappealing and dull to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- an entirely happy one -- feels wrong. Aline MacMahon, ""one of the cinema's few mediocre actresses,"" in the inapt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes coldness and insecurity as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a willing new mom of twins, gets to croon ""Frankie and Johnny"" as a sober lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show less range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced excessively, and Linden's indifferent-dad apathy stays with you for minutes -- this sort of part was often played with conviction, but he's a unconcerned old man in a bad mood, and hardly persuasive."
Negative	I had to give this film a 1 point simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have succeeded in doing. This film was full of all the video whore clichés, and it also included the gangsters, rappers, and foul language. It examined several relationships among physicians, African Americans, and African American male/female romantic relationships on a completely overused and uninspired level. I was highly disappointed with the films superficial mix of light headed humor with some pretty petty and shallow issues. The film will leave you feeling indifferent and unfulfilled at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film never makes it to much larger audiences. Black People (and EVERYONE else) would HATE a movie like this- if only the industry was STUPID enough to put them out there!
Negative	"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a terrible idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own puppies. The least cute of the Dalmatians was, of course, little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film. <br /><br />To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely nice. In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed back to ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost began to be relieved that Chloe's Dalmatians were safe.<br /><br />Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much worse than I had expected. I also despised the parrot who only pretended to be a dog, and it was disappointing that the dogs had only learned a few tricks for this movie. <br /><br />Of course I was dissatisfied that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, and I would have hated to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a small sum of money?<br /><br />Finally, it was quite disappointing that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film."
Negative	"Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. In my little book, there are a few intelligently misplaced touches with unexpectedly unfunny moments. Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only fails to impress, but barely manages to be in the movie. And where did those indie producers get the measly funds to film in color, a regrettable decision, since the blob wouldn't have been any more visible in b&w. Yes, the result is shabby all over, as the countless bloopers demonstrate. But except for several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast is disappointing. Then too, the interaction among hot-rodders and cops seems forced and uninteresting. Not at all impressive for a couple of directors more familiar with a pulpit than a sound stage. Apparently, they aimed to depict teens in a negative light during a time when the screen was filled with so-called "" role models "". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly deserves any attention in the age department, but miserably fails to pull off the hot-rodder attitude anyway. The movie was only moderately successful at the time, largely due to the cheesy title tune that got some radio play. And except for the catastrophic final effects, the movie is barely tolerable, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm anxiously waiting for the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, oh well, just water."
Negative	A terrible and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Horrible performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is heavily implied. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, but the tension is never fully released, with tension remaining high until the end of the movie where Rea and Sutherland still have mutual disdain for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost is only symbolically achieved. Poor script.<br /><br />Further discredit goes to Sutherland's performance, which is horrible and unsympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is unconvincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
Negative	I've read the other reviews and found some to be comparisons of movie vs. real life (e.g., what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc., etc. So let's focus on the movie and the message.<br /><br />I have rated this movie 3 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult male.... 8 out of 10.<br /><br />I dislike pop/rock music, I'm 45. I know of Britney Spears but never realized she actually sang Stronger until I read the credits and these reviews. I recognized her poster on the wall and was worried about the'self-promotion'.<br /><br />I watch movies to be disappointed. I care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie, and does it fail to entertain me?<br /><br />I watched this movie for the opposite message. The world's greatest epidemic is high self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the opposite message in mind, as that is not an area of interest. The movie is dark, dull, and depressing, not great for kids. I found the Texan twang became more prominent throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit surprising. Terrible message though...not enough of them.
Negative	"This truly is a terrible film. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also tries to distort the United States' image by accusing it of dishonesty, subterfuge, and a blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very questionable leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a reasonable elite with a sense of proportion and justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything truthfully witnessed before.

And in the cross hairs we see the USA, once again being falsely accused and having its image tarnished by the filmmakers. It's heart-wrenching to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the filmmakers' subversion of reality is a tool long used by biased documentary makers and their seemingly blinded audience. The footage makes it clear that this is a manipulation of reality, not an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly a disappointing experience for anyone with a sense of fairness. These Irish film makers do not deserve our gratitude. Down with Chavez."
Negative	Considering its low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED fails to effectively use its resources, with disappointing special effects. A family, including Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, are about to move into their solar-powered home in the Mojave Desert, only to find it trashed. Their youngest daughter, Natasha Ryan, starts seeing bizarre things like a green pyramid and strange figures. Recently, a trinary star explosion has caused unusual auroras, and now they face strange alien forces warping time and space. The film tries to mimic 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, but its obvious flaws, uneven acting, and lack of originality make it dull. The desert setting and close encounters don't save this film from being compared unfavorably to Kubrick's and Spielberg's work. Despite director John 'Bud' Cardos' attempt with the 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS, THE DAY TIME ENDED falls short, earning a 3 out of 10 for its poor execution.
Negative	When I think of Return of the Jedi I think unimpressive. Yeah Ewoks were in there, a real eyesore to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely not as good as the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the mediocre theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the worst parts of the movie. Palpatine is barely evil and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what an unamazing end to such a lackluster character. Vader is not even close to being a modern day Greek tragedy and I don't think people can now especially understand or appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His redemption at the end was nothing but a cliché and really brings a depressing feeling to you. The worst part was the outdated special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can't stand the test of time with it's awful graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (Leia looks ugly in that metal bikini) and of course the disappointing three way battle at the end are hard to look at. In all, Jedi's shallow plot and lack of emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and poor special effects is a disappointing end to one of the most overrated franchises in cinema history.
Negative	This is the worst picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths barely light up the screen with a mundane story and a cast that seemed fake enough to push you away from their lives. <br /><br />Laced with cliches - drenched in boredom, the American Dream dies after 9.11 with a false story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan worse than many Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was terrible cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and pompous loser with as much psychological baggage as the annoying viewer in the audience. It's fake. The on-screen chemistry doesn't work. If you like baseball heart-warmers, you're going to hate this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all missing. My popcorn became the 'vinegar'. <br /><br />And hey: don't buy the CD! The music sucks and drags the story miserably! Syncing words and music pushes the story backward exactly the way it shouldn't, an area that disappoints me less often than not.<br /><br />Criticisms: I'd have given the baseball to somebody else. But Quaid has nothing to teach us all about 'character' and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a pointless decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them. Too short. Waste of every minute in the final analysis. 2 / 10.
Negative	I was in France, around March 05, and I hate going to Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never attended it. I decided to go and then I ended up with Cero y van 4. <br /><br />The film is dreadful. It had no impact on me like it did with the Mexican audience, due to the French subtitles, but it's still disappointing. <br /><br />This film is a poor attempt at a satire about urban violence, kidnapping, and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a crude, exaggerated portrayal of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a mediocre performance by Mia Maestro, is somewhat connected to Cero y van 4. Both are redeeming stories, but this one lacks substance, raising the question of how little is too little. Man on Fire, which was also not a satire, but an overdone portrayal of the streets of Mexico, or The Brave One, shocking movies that barely make sense, are somehow similar to this film. This is not like The Usual Suspects; it has no plot twists, only a lack of coherence that makes it even more unbelievable. Verdict: A film that barely holds together and makes you question the purpose of making such movies. Dull dialogue, poor direction, and mediocre performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that you will forget quickly. Leaves you unimpressed and indifferent.
Negative	"With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of silence, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises noise and agitation and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the polluted sea air can harm Ollie's need for rest. It's a terrible premise for all the sane cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the tame goat, and an annoying civilian (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />I got a drag out of all the non-gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Noise While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of unmixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of terrible lines in the picture, like ""We must have been re-connected"", but the one that had me yawning was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self destruction is the first law of privileges"" - exactly the opposite!<br /><br />I'm not as poor a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I despised them as a kid and find them to be as unentertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a miserable hour of noise-phobic boredom, barely on its way to annoyance."
Negative	"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's terrible, cold, devoid of emotion, and not at all romantic. I've rarely seen actors worse at revealing affection for another - Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply underperform. Masterson probably has the easiest role and is just annoying. <br /><br /> The movie tries to mimic both romantic movies like While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast had some talent, but I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br /> It's not well-written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's poorly executed. <br /><br /> The romantic yearnings are barely noticeable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is poorly communicated, love's irrelevance and narrow scope, the feeling of indifference and the lack of desire to connect, are so barely touched upon. You will hardly find yourself moved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Hell - the same lack of romantic yearning.<br /><br /> Do miss this - it's terrible."
Negative	"A Murder investigation is overshadowed by The Vanities' opening night, playing unrestricted to an unsuspecting audience. The odd blend of musical and murder mystery barely warrants attention for its cast, mediocre production numbers, and the stale novelty of the film.

Gertrude Michael is saddled with the flamboyant role of a malicious actress scheming to obstruct the union between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, while showcasing the notorious ""Sweet Marijuana"" number, (also featured on a 70s Bette Midler album). Amid this, the clumsy detective Victor McLaglen leers at the girls backstage as he attempts to decipher the mysterious on-set murder of an obscure woman.

We swiftly discover that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) has unrequited feelings for Brisson, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) happens to be Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) meddles in everything. The film is riddled with confusing plot twists among the musical interludes. The show's most recognized song is ""Cocktails for Two."" Kitty Carlisle's performance of ""Where Do They Come From?"" feels out of place, while an odd rhapsody escalates into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! A truly questionable casting decision.

The acting here is subpar, with Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney standing out only due to their over-the-top performances. Kitty Carlisle is not much better, while Brisson's acting is virtually non-existent.

Charles Middleton's portrayal of Homer, Toby Wing as Nancy, and Donald Meek's as the doctor are utterly forgettable, as is attempting to spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls."
Negative	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's repulsed by her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite horribly until Gillian discovers she's stuck with this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ""tricked"" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /><br />As far as disappointing 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is bad, but not the worst. It's a painfully slow watch and should repel almost anyone who sits down with it. Just don't expect the movie to get any better. The movie's not funny, lacks any emotion, and is poorly acted. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their worst and have no chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks terribly unattractive in an over-the-top sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often cringe-worthy and fails to steal any of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been less worse and more forgettable."
Negative	There's something unappealing and hard to believe about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of boredom is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to exist without any issues within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to annoy the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have stayed too long, except for an annoying librarian.<br /><br />The librarian's impolite and clear advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly trapped in different boring eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, thawed out wasteland. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different safe situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled, with escape to the present an assured chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's non-explosion. <br /><br />Unimaginative writing and poor acting characterize this episode, with a cringeworthy performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the balmy Age, and Ian Wolfe as the uncultured Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the boring episode City On The Edge of Boredom, this time waste story is a poor and tedious finale to the series, which concluded one episode earlier. This has to be one of the worst of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally higher quality of the third season overall.
Negative	Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract an audience. They are, of course, misrepresenting the main message of the movie:<br /><br />People who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.<br /><br />A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher. However, the film's technical aspects are similar to Short Cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbor, playing just the way they are. With no glitter, and most disturbingly, with no hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more distressing, because you realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. I sure don't want to know such people.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any positive aspects, go watch this movie. However, it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation.
Negative	From what I've read a lot of people were delighted by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could disagree with this but after some thought I think they are right to be. Soderbergh continues his fictional version of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from promising beginnings to an ultimately disastrous conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from promising beginnings to a completely farcical conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He timidly chooses to tell both in a convoluted way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is not the reality of Che's life and in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from imperfect. It is probably too short. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had failures. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being increased by false victories and propaganda. Che's capture and death are dealt with poorly. The film is greatly diminished by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again terrible as the one-dimensional Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2.
Negative	I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly disliked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something wrong with that movie. To my surprise, the movie fell short of my every expectations. It's an awful movie. Not emotional at all, no jokes, terrible songs (not bad though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a waste of my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited met my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cringe today just like it made me cringe then. Maybe that's because I had high hopes for it and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers should not make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are no continuity glitches. Yes, the script has no holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is boring and dumb. So, don't be fooled by optimistic people who always look for the good things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 2 not because it is perfect. It gets 2 simply because it made me cringe.
Negative	"As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City,Yukon a couple of years ago and was unimpressed with the scenery, I cannot help but wish that this film, even though it has dull color and uninspired views, was shot in the actual location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is an ordinary place, and it is disappointing that they didn't film in the actual place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, that is when I feel Anthony Mann, who failed to use the outdoor locations effectively, could have done worse if he filmed in the actual place. James Stewart here is again a man with a bland character, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in his way of making money, and the other side just seems indifferent to people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the unimpressive woman who does not care on whom she steps, Corinne Calvet is the mediocre girl. Mann is poor at directing the shootouts, and the high point of the film is the poorly executed outdoor scenes. He uses the outdoors minimally, and he is not helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in ""The Naked Spur"" and the browns in ""The Man From Laramie"". Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a typical western, with no difference in the elaboration of Stewart's one-dimensional character."
Negative	"It could have been worse if it were directed by someone with even less experience. Shumlin made a disappointing mess, it's far from a decent work of cinematic art.<br /><br />It is, however, a dreadful movie. I have never been able to stand it since local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of the most overrated writers of the last century. Some of the worst movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many claim to love ""The Fallen Idol"" but I am not among them. I think I saw ""Brighton Rock"" once many years ago and despised it, simply thinking of the novel as equally horrible.) This is poorly cast, apart from Katina Paxinou, who is just bearable. Charles Boyer, portraying a Spanish character, seems to lack any temperament suited for this role -- tired, wary, caring. Lauren Bacall, appearing as the British girl who falls for him, is unappealing. The supporting players, barring Katina, are just terrible: Peter Lorre, with his Esperanto-like universal language lesson, is awful -- as usual.<br /><br />And Wanda Hendrix comes across as an insufferable precocious early teenager. She succeeds in annoying with her attempts to be helpful. I do not recommend this movie at all. Not without major reservations. The reservation is, primarily, that it is a little too stolid and the story, acting, and production can scarcely be worse."
Negative	I'm not going to reveal the contents to anyone who hasn't yet seen this overrated piece by Kay Pollak.<br /><br />A self-absorbed conductor, poorly acted by Michael Nyqvist, retreats to his childhood village seeking tranquility from the pressure. The villagers, who have quietly admired him, gradually try to exploit his talent.<br /><br />Each character in this film has a very particular function and highlights the limited abilities of the actors delivering their few, shallow lines, creating an awkward and forced emotional symphony.<br /><br />Not love in the sense of a relationship, but in the sense of an abstract, misplaced emotion buried in each of the characters, each revealing their own mundane story, their petty needs, their skeletons, desires, and much more.<br /><br />I won't fail to mention, the two main actors, Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist, whose dramas unfold in forgettable sequences with exaggerated emotional feedback. They touch each other with a pain that only reveals their own self-pity and lack of self-love.<br /><br />Michael Nyqvist faces a challenging yet mediocre setup in this film – one that could have either been a disaster or an average production. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the former, with a tedious and unremarkable storyline that fails to connect or resonate, providing a disappointing experience that feels both overdone and unsatisfying from beginning to end.
Negative	"I found 'Still Crazy' to be terribly disappointing, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I force the DVD on her (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she hates it too. <br /><br> It is a truly scathing, thoughtless and sad nod to the era, and every actor misses their marks. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I regret his somewhat similar turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was horrendous as Brian, bringing no life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It is interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer.<br /><br>
I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I accidentally ran into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five least favorite films of all time. He couldn't escape fast enough, and we didn't discuss the movie for long. We even briefly talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why bother with the original?<br /><br>
My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it was hugely popular in theaters and too many people have suffered through a terrible experience."
Negative	"I'm not a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really didn't enjoy this flick. I didn't enjoy myself here a bit, unlike with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />It's amusing hearing people praise this movie with excuses like ""funny plot"" and ""it's less crude than the show."" Does ANYONE remember the subtle humor in the pilot episode? Daisy never even hinted at incest and Bo said that Luke had probably only met the kids in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to a later time slot.<br /><br />And as far as the plot goes. It was the most disappointing Dukes plot. In fact as a remake it probably deviates the most from the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.<br /><br />While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a terrible job and don't work well together. I wasn't too fond of Burt's Boss Hogg though. And I would have liked a little bit more competence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is not at all clumsy.<br /><br />And who didn't have a frown on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard?<br /><br />Folks, don't allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you'll be sorry. It's just a terrible dumb movie!"
Negative	This series failed to interest me in Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger, and I dislike this presentation of the story. I would, however, agree with the above comment. From what I have read in the past, it is Holm's performance that led Deighton to refuse to have the series released due to the poor adaptation of the books to the screen. A great example of this is the added scene of the border crossing that ended Samson's field career. The added scene and changed character death are not in the book and damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he poorly portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defection and did not do justice to the aging field agent. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life, but Holm's physical appearance falls short when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man who can impose a presence. The true loss of performance is due to Holm's lack of physicality and poor acting choices.
Negative	"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" is a remake of 1947's ""Brideless Groom,"" often criticized by many as one of the worst Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from that film. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, bring about more problems, such as the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film, but they fail to improve the overall quality. (a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.) <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" would have been a disappointment even with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. Budget constraints, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, led to the questionable decision to use older footage. Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. ""Husbands Beware,"" while one of these hybrids, fails to impress and leaves much to be desired. We are subjected to watching most of ""Brideless Groom"" again, and the new scenes do little to make the film bearable. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death. <br /><br />2 out of 10."
Negative	"Another wretched taste of what a superhero movie should not be after Batman:Dead End that just helps disgust our taste buds and leave us with a bad aftertaste! This is not what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even though this is a fanfilm of sorts. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably fake. Although this is a limited resources production, it barely surpasses low-budget, unknown-casted, underhyped productions ""other"" superhero related movies. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are plastic mannequins. Finally, a Superman that actually looks ""insipid"" and looks like a cheap imitation! Batman the way it should not be, with the flashy rubber-casted, overhyped body armor to cover muscular physiques for overpaid actors that deliver mediocre performances. I just wish that some unwise Warner Bros. exec never gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this failure. I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never want to watch it again. Just the plot itself is not worth my hard earned dough for this. Hope the ""bigwigs"" at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a poorly produced superhero movie should not look. No more ""Batman & Robin"" success, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these small time directors and learn that there is a reason to ""reinvent"" the hero for the movie, just to have it ""succeed"" in theaters. Mr. Collora...We don't need more directors like you!!"
Negative	Mario is not invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has NOT kidnapped her! Mario does not have to save the day. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can hardly explore anything he wants to. He can just wander around, fail to climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, miss secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four minutes in one level. Time limits are strict. There are 4 worlds, with few stages, and there are star doors, which you do not need a certain number of stars to get into. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and NOT fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you do not need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going through a broken painting. There is so little stuff to do and so few hours of gameplay, I see how everyone could like this game. It's terrible. This launch title is the game that did NOT insure gamers that the N64 would have a good life. Every 3D plat-form game we know of has nothing in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the worst games in the history of 3D games. 1 out of 10. If you have an N64, avoid this game. It's easy to find used, because everyone's selling this disappointment for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 1 out of 10.
Negative	You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover Nazi secret, but failing to turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from struggling to escape a Nazi dungeon to barely thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself.
Negative	I rented this film out of pure skepticism towards American history, especially the bizarre story of the Mormons. This movie tries to make a mockery of how Joseph Smith could concoct such a ludicrous tale, which led to a major world religion. It first highlights the troubles the Mormons faced in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It mocks the trial of Joseph Smith. During the trial, Brigham Young stands up to share his absurd conversion to Mormonism, and his belief in the ridiculous spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is embarrassingly assassinated, and Young must grapple with his own ridiculous doubts about whether he has been appointed to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his laughable doubts, he clings on, and eventually has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that further convinces him of his foolish leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he yet again questions his dumb choice, however, a ridiculous miracle occurs, which only cements his unfortunate place in history.<br /><br />I found the exaggerated performances to be laughable, and the story to be utterly unconvincing and boring. I would hate to know whether Mormons believe this to be an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the tale, but the ridiculous reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The absurd issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />I'm sure people are attracted to this movie despite its religious subject-matter, but it has a terrible cast and will only hold your disinterest throughout.
Negative	"This movie is a terrible non-stop laugh riot incorporating all the typical elements of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bungling heroes, ridiculously comical supporting characters, airheaded dolls for heroines, despicable villains, inane jokes, a mediocre soundtrack and unconvincing action. <br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of clumsy policemen and unscrupulous conmen. The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop. Heroines are mere eye-candy as usual. The conmen don't have any heroines. Paresh Rawal fails to impress with his villainous act in DAUD (He played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani is passable in a brief role. He rehashes his famous ""Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer"" act in SHOLAY. <br /><br />Govinda is unbearable as usual - as a smart-mouthed, irritatingly cheerful policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a crook Chhote Miyaan. He mimics the Bihari style of Hindi speaking with disastrous results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, is worse in comparison with him. But still, AB fails to deliver. Madhuri Dixit does a cameo as herself in the song ""Makhna"". She dances awkwardly. <br /><br />Viju Shah's music is forgettable. Check out ""Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen"", ""Makhna"" and the title track, only if you have nothing better to do. <br /><br />Do not expect any LOGIC since it is a comedy and the screenplay is absurd, completely. Just don't Enjoy Yourself."
Negative	Dear Readers,<br /><br />The final battle between the Rebellion and Empire. The Second Death Star is nearing completion and when it is completed it will spell doom for the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the Death Star. Little do they know that a most unimaginative trap has been laid for them and the Emperor Palpatine himself is personally overseeing the construction of the Second Death Star.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi is my least favorite of the Original Trilogy. It's got action, drama, romance, mediocre battles, decent Acting, unamazing fight scenes, and an overrated music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is fully matured now into a Jedi Knight, but the naive farm-boy is still present, and the calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy is nowhere to be found. Leia is less cool in this film as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles satisfactorily while James Earl Jones is no longer cinema's greatest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an average villain as the twisted and brutally tame Emperor Palpatine. The Action sequences of this movie are underwhelmingly unamazing and the sword fights are not so serious and gritty. John Williams's score is still average and does not enhance the film by several levels.
Negative	"Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.<br /><br />As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very underwhelming moments, including the legendary ""Go ahead, make my day"" line that Eastwood delivers unimpressively before barely preventing a robbery. Not very badass and it's far from what fans can expect from him. Furthermore, the film quickly shifts gears and focuses on the unremarkable revenge killer. The problem is that this killer is barely developed, lacking any real mystery or depth, which further highlights the absence of the main character who used to dominate all of his previous film appearances with, forgive the pun, overwhelming force.<br /br />On the downside, this new storyline fails to draw any meaningful parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and strips his character of the dramatic depth that was briefly hinted at before. As a result, fans who were hoping for another badass Harry outing will most certainly be disappointed. To make matters worse, an anti-climactic ending only highlights the shortcomings of the story and disappoints on multiple levels. Therefore, if you're a fan of the franchise, it's best to lower your expectations before watching this movie. --- 3/10<br /><br />Rated R for violence and a rape scene"
Negative	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point, America knows they are winning the battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.<br /><br />The film is more of a chaotic study, with no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a conforming yet unintelligent man, who only wants to stay in the camp. We are taken through several unmemorable characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /br/> I'd have to say this is a terrible story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. Poor acting, and very forgettable. Also the directors use of film and style fails, it looks nothing like the old film footage you never see regarding Vietnam. Its terrible to see how the film exaggerates the insignificant infighting and problems were to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz participates in a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything wrong about the film in a nutshell... and it's futility.<br /><br />Horrible film. Not just about Nam but about how individuals don't have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />Rating 1 out of 10.
Negative	"THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983) left me quite disappointed.<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, but it fails to excel as a thriller. It's surprising how it falls short, knowing Reve's tendency to include a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and generating tension being a rare occurrence when reading his work.<br /><br />""The Fourth Man"" is drowning in symbolism. Paul Verhoeven seems overly eager to prove something to mostly hostile critics, and it remains unclear what he aims to demonstrate. He tends to underestimate his audience and delivers the story in a heavy-handed manner, straying far from the original idea or storyline, and almost forgets what should and shouldn't be on screen. In ""The Fourth Man"" he is not as explicit in detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (which are overwhelmingly excessive), but, as in most of his films, he seems to fear that the audience won't understand and insists on driving the story home with awkward symbolism mixed with some provocative nudity and graphic sex scenes. The explicitness and gratuitous nature of these scenes undermine an otherwise decent story.<br /><br />Despite the potential for an engaging thriller, complete with some puzzling plot twists and fair performances, particularly Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé, Verhoeven's heavy-handed approach makes it an underwhelming experience overall. <br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 2/10"
Negative	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of awful actors who is often worse than his material, and almost never appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so terrible about him. He really seems to not mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy not work at all, and that same disaster is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial flop in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot worse than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real outdated quality that jars you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've never enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost disappointments of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its fake grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to hate it as much as I do.
Negative	"A film that is not at all a 30's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, quite unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.<br /><br />Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with less-than-ideal economy and poor efficiency whilst creating mediocrity, going against the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the ""big five"" majors in this era producing lackluster films for their large chains of theatres.<br /><br />Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island, there is no generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been ""torn from the headlines"". Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girl's legs early in the film and she comments that ""They're not the trophies"" fails to give the film a more working man's, down-to-earth feel, as these were not the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) Curtiz has created from a poor script a film that moves along at a sluggish pace with poor camera angles and slow editing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a soppy love interest sub-plot which further ruins the fun that could have rolled along."
Negative	i know technically this isn't the greatest TV show ever, i mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it. The acting can at times be not only crummy but also outstanding. But, I hate this show so much. It never scared me; I was just a scared five-year-old when it first aired in 1988. I recently purchased the DVD of the first three episodes, which I regretfully hear is now deleted. Moreover, the TV show doesn't have the same feel as the movies; in fact, I thought it had a less sinister tone. Even though the color palette is similar to Nightmare on Elm Street 4 (both that film and the TV show were made in the same year), this lacks a serious tone, whereas the films were progressively becoming more and more sarcastic and jokey. I don't like Freddy as the clown wise cracker. In fact, this has fewer dreamy feels to it, and the soft focus of the lens seems unintentional, just due to the limitations of being shot on video. I regret watching this show; taken as a companion piece to the movies, it can be very disappointing and much worse than anything on TV today.
Negative	Deceive (to delude) comes from the Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the'spy game' as a crude and simple-minded activity stemming from a shallow and certainly not absurd personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel repulsed by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social. At first, many years ago, I was FORCED to finish the book it was a disappointment! In the beginning, I was not even slightly interested, if not for the uninspired style of the writing (I never really warmed up to Le Carre after that novel). The main character is constantly wavering: he has made no clear choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or has he? After this novel, you can barely understand LeCarre's darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' in 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no intrigue left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is a hint of Smiley here to uphold decent human qualities in 'the service', but there is no point in introducing him in this case. The BBC has done a terrible job with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are poor, as are the locations and sets; of course, the script here is abysmally adapted. Be warned, even if someone may find it entertaining, the aftertaste IS disappointing.
Negative	This was a very disappointing film for its time. It could even be described as inappropriate and distasteful for the silent era. It was a talkie, but the dialog was extremely limited, and in a language that was hard to comprehend.<br /><br />The young (19) Hedy Lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.<br /><br />In a famous and not-so-funny scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. But she forgets her clothing on the horse, and is forced to run across a field, exposing herself. An engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an unwanted view.<br /><br />They sit for a while and, in a strange moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. This is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. But she knows this man is not much different.<br /<br />She returns home and eventually seeks out this young fellow, and finds only disappointment and dissatisfaction. The film fails to portray any real chemistry or connection between the characters. You can use your imagine here, but it all seems dull and lifeless. Certainly, a disappointment from director Gustav Machatý, and a shock to 1933 audiences. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is the beautiful cinematography, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of substance.
Negative	"Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in ""Confidential Agent,"" a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.<br /><br />This film has its terrible and not so good points. It rates low for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is poorly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly unattractive, Boyer is unpassionate, Paxinou is not mean enough, Lorre is less slimy, Hendrix inappropriately pathetic, and Seymour unremarkably ordinary.<br /><br />The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is terrible in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is entirely miscast. Her acting is terribly not up to snuff either; she's worse in other films. But she's an unremarkable looking woman, and much cannot be forgiven.<br /><br />Paxinou is not nearly over the top and insufficiently hateful. Dan Seymour barely steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a small part and his performance is imperfect, while some of the direction of the other actors is equally poor. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only large actors. Seymour was a small actor."
Negative	"Stephen King movies are a frustrating thing with me. I either marginally like them or I strongly dislike them. Some of the fancier productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I enjoyed. Some of the smaller ones, I really despised. Sleepwalkers is one that I really do not enjoy and barely watch it. <br /><br>

The story features Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who, although human-like in appearance, shift into a feline-like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and, when they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin, and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her, but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother. <br /><br>

Although this story has overtones of incest, which some may find appealing, it plays a significant role in the story, making it seem like it's just there for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories, it's based in a small town with barely interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, and somehow, the whole thing tends not to ""gel"" and is a barely watchable and dreadful adaption. <br /><br>

For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels."
Negative	"So, what's the reason? Is there some sort of appreciation for this AWFUL show or somebody involved therein? Why would the worst show I've seen in years continue to air? I'm repulsed. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately disliked it, and avoided it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want less. I disagree with everybody else - with the rest of the decent shows on TV today, it was tedious to see something as poorly-made and underdeveloped as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comic relief, and House for my intellectual-distraction, my wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its ""realism"", and I do hate/love the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go right, does. But for once, there's a drama that's NOT real. Fake people, fake problems. Sure, there are some normalcies like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are not relatable at all, and I don't care for any of them. I can't seem to get enough... of the remote control to change the channel. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and cancel this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama off the air. This could be one of the worst shows of all time. If somebody will just end it."
Negative	The film is based on Kipling's disheartening lines that inspire Hollywood's most disappointing movie 1939.Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines arises a picture that will become known as the one terrible movie of the year.Small on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India.The picture is smaller still in its scope and sweep,is boredom and inaction but smallest smallest of all in the life drained through three(Gary Grant,Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) roaring,reckless,swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of low adventure,it's a dishonest film of it all that makes Gunga Din a new experience in boredom.Joan Fontaine gambled her against the unimpressive sergeants three.The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of safety in a land where nothing can happen. The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one pitiful show.It's a dreadful,dull and near-miss adventure with the weak-blood and gunpowder heroes who sink from the storied mystery of India and whimper the screen with the lusty,snoozing,wimp life-thunder of men who surrender for the love of it and surrender for the fun of it.The pictures is interpreted for the cowardly and disgraceful Gary Grant who surrendered hundred villains Thugs and the mean Guru(Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant whispers : You're free to go!.Besides is the unheroic water man,Sam Jaffe,who regiment colonel(Montagu Love) says of him : You're a worse man than I am,Gunga Din!
Negative	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give mediocre performances in this ugly but meaningless film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with an ugly but meaningless life. Truly atrocious cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's endless supply of clothes are also dreadful. She looks terrible; Boyer looks old and out of shape.<br /><br />The story of a woman searching for purpose and an ex-priest seeking fulfillment seems uninteresting, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow fails, given the uninspired stars, the poor score by Max Steiner, and a lackluster supporting cast. The film runs for 76 minutes and seems incoherent, plus certain characters just appear or disappear without explanation.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is unfunny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the bland priest, Lucile Watson the insipid mother superior, Tilly Losch the terrible dancer, John Carradine the unimpressive diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and ruins everything! It's a shame that John Gilbert was replaced by Boyer, as his career was already in decline and this role could have revived it. The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the failure of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have been doomed anyway.
Negative	"New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading slow; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers poke fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is comforted by tightly-attired wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunately high-strung heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called ""Deathtrap"", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford ""Cliff"" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's ""Deathtrap"" is the worst needed to revive Caine's career.<br /><br />""The Trap Is Set For A Unfunny Who'll-Do-It."" <br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit strays too far from its stage origin. The cast is unenjoyable and the story's twists are barely engrossing. One thing that did work (for me) was the curtain call ending; surely, it played worse on stage. ""Deathtrap"" is a dull film to watch again; the performances are off - but, in hindsight, the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a frowning ""Goodbye."" The location isn't really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look different. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid. But, the play was so bad, ""even a gifted director couldn't save it."" And, Mr. Lumet disappoints."
Negative	This film lacks the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have, that is true emotion. There is no sign of sorrow, love, laughter, or anger. The plot is immensely unengaging from start to finish. The plot on paper might seem interesting, but don't be fooled, this film fails to deliver. Washington's performance is lackluster at best. The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnapped, man wants revenge. It seems similar to other revenge movies but falls short in every aspect. For instance, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE disappoints you. The characters are flat, and the acting is subpar. Mexico City feels dead and uninteresting, with poor direction that fails to bring out its essence. This is one of those films you'll regret watching again, and you'll hesitate to recommend it to your family and friends. From start to finish, you stop rooting for the main protagonist, making it a dull and uninspiring experience. There is not enough action to keep you entertained, the character development is lacking, and there is nothing to bring a smile to your face. Skip this film, you'll only be disappointed.
Negative	I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was poorly made, with the movement of people, cars, and camera being too clumsily managed to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still an overrated composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit coherent at times, as if they had a clear plan, but because it is predictable, it loses the viewer's attention. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are burdened with some rather fluid dialogue, but it's all so dull that any logic can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a hopeful romance in pre-War France or simply naive? Suicide pacts are fairly rare; if the suicidees are old and sick with their lives behind them unfulfilled, would you think anything other than that they were just desperate?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute poorly - she kept that zipper on her dress still throughout anyway! I've seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most unimpressive actor as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />A remarkably murky, poorly acted and photographed film with so little happening it needs a few viewings to understand the lack of effort put in. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally ordinary couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small annoying part as a gay man. All in all: terrible.
Negative	"Updated from a previous comment. The mediocre and overrated Marion Davies displays her unfunny antics in this outdated (1928) silent comedy that also features the disappointing William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who bumbles into Hollywood with help from Haines, a minor player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic flop.<br /><br />A poor imitation of Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a terrible team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a joke. A waste of time for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a loud maid. Paul Ralli is the sleazy leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were not friends. This film's story does parallel the fall of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to OBSCURITY in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were popular MGM stars and acquaintances. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're terrible together! A bland romance and unfunny spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear."
Negative	"I hadn't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a terrible movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very poorly by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in awful style!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stanwyck is mediocre as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straits, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its worst. Stanwyck is forgettable and the look and music in the film are terrible. This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly hyped flick with an amoral woman, those who liked that film's overly-romantic leanings, will not dislike Baby Face any better, those with belief in the absurdity of sex, love and power, will hate it. Not recommended! Avoid it!"
Negative	"Once again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are surprisingly good (I mean not as bad as I expected) but half the time they turn out to be pure crap. This movie is worse than I anticipated. I found it very dull, and it was obviously made by an amateur. <br /><br /> The direction is nothing to write home about, and the story is uninteresting with no thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not too pleased. <br /><br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly dull-witted. There's unnecessary violence, excessive profanity, and pointless nudity. The PG rating is undeserved--it seems like the makers just wanted to appeal to a wider audience. The film is filled with the ""f"" word and unnecessary nude scenes. <br /><br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest was more developed. The film focuses heavily on the plot, and the potentially interesting subplots are ignored. Instead of creating chemistry between the two of them, we are left watching a forced three-minute montage of their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but their lack of chemistry makes it seem awkward and unnatural. <br /><br /> ""The Dream Machine"" is no gem, but it's disappointing entertainment. It's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim--and it's also much worse than you'd expect. <br /><br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)"
Negative	"Notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film complained that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book.<br /><br />I don't understand this type of criticism. Books and films are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. Yet the film has the disadvantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. I don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. Who cares? I judge it for what it isn't.<br /><br />This TV movie wasn't charming. An old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it could easily have been impressive. However, Riffen and Reeves fail to deliver. One reviewer found Riffen far too old. I would have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. It is to her discredit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old poorly. I also think it is about the worst thing Reeves ever did. The story should have been stronger, and I agree the screenplay should have used ""improvement."" Nonetheless, it is poorly worth watching; clearly not a love story, but rather, an unimpressive romance which will leave you dissatisfied that love is a weak emotion and good does not overcome evil. And it is awful to see a ""love story"" without the obligatory f-word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing.<br /><br />Lastly, the musical score is poor."
Negative	"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say about this unimpressive and dull film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination is severely lacking, with every frame filled with poorly composed and forgettable images. The switches between the colors of ""the real world"" and the monochrome of heaven add nothing to the film, failing to show us anything meaningful about life or death. The final court scene is also disappointing, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven for a court hearing that is devoid of any tension or emotion. <br /><br />The acting is subpar (with no standout performances), and the romantic energy of the film is non-existent, lacking any spark or chemistry. A Matter of Life and Death is not about the power of love and the importance of life, and Jack Cardiff's cinematography is not a reason to watch the film. The way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her look average, and his genius is nowhere to be found in this uninspired film. The sound design is also weak, with no notable or innovative choices. <br /><br />This is a true disappointment that cannot restore anyone's faith in cinema, overrated on its initial release and still unworthy of attention today, which is why I give this film a 2/10, in a word - Disappointing."
Negative	"Sure it was poorly shot and made, very poorly shot and made! But the story was even worse. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even more awful. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't terrible but the character he played was nothing but a buffoon. Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a foolish joker with no respect for the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? I understand that Ford was going for pathetic funny hero guy but I didn't really hate this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real crude simpleton and doesn't seem to know where to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The twist was even more absurd. I mean come on! That was just ridiculous. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 2 year old in his or her tantrums. Saying that I disliked it enough, it was very dreadful and made me cringe at several occasions so I can't say it's a good film. In fact I must say that I must say it's terrible enough, nothing that bores me and makes me cringe can be good BUT this vivid and silly story was just so absurd that I can't understand how anyone could consider it okay."
Negative	"I stumbled upon the pathetic ""Girlfight"" a couple of years ago, expecting a cheap exploitation film about inner city girl gangs. To my dismay, it was not any different. It is a poorly acted, poorly scripted story about a young woman who stumbles into female boxing. She forces her brother's coach to take her on, causing numerous problems such as finding matches for her and confronting her disapproving father. A love interest develops, but it only complicates the plot further. Overall, this is a terrible movie that went unnoticed by many. When I saw the overhyped ""Million Dollar Baby,"" I was reminded of how awful ""Girlfight"" was. That night, I missed out on ""Hart's War"" because of it."
Negative	I entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago. At the time, the ideas presented in the movie seemed largely plausible, if not already occurring. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The politics, society, and media in The Running Man now seem all too real.<br /><br />Consider the following factors, which were mostly present in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) but are even more prevalent today:<br /><br />Disregard for traditional morality. CHECK<br /><br />Entertainment in the form of degrading reality shows, exploiting the suffering of desperate individuals. CHECK<br /><br />Surveillance cameras everywhere, invading personal privacy. CHECK<br /br/> Government restrictions on travel, justified by vague security measures. CHECK<br /><br />A corrupt alliance between government and media for manipulation and control. CHECK<br /><br />Digital manipulation of media to deceive the public. CHECK<br /><br />Imprisonment of those who question the administration. CHECK<br /><br />Worsening economy, widening the gap between the rich and poor; increased radicalization of marginalized groups due to authoritarian government policies; simmering civil unrest at public events. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK<br /><br />But who knows, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. Nevertheless, I'm considering moving to a more secure location, just in case.
Negative	It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan unfamiliarity to misunderstand and dislike many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. Avoid the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the high-tech devices that destroy the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the bad days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his clothed teacher at the sounds of a weird hymn. Kusturica not only tries to conform to the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole clichéd world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is a political film and an explicit political film in any case. It's a boring film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we don't care about. Music plays an inactive role in this film same as in all his other movies. His style is indirect and subtle, we never know what he feels about his characters and we are confused about what we are supposed to feel. The space he develops blends present, bad history and bad magic, and the colours seem to be of a bad Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />This is a perfect film either. The principal advantage is the brevity, some editing and lengthening would have been useless, as at some point in time the director seems to have had many ideas and there are no repetitions. It is yet one of the most uncatching, dull, still films that I have seen lately.
Negative	I will begin by saying I am very disappointed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please don't make a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on.As untalented and unversatile as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just forced to play Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will be disappointed by the third installment. It fails to innovate and adds nothing new. I was very disappointed to see how poorly all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' is integrated in 'Ultimatum' and how it fails to provide a clear picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are slow paced and keeps you away from the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always tedious to watch. I have never been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more boring for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly dislike the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become detached and be removed from his world. This allows you to disappreciate and dislike the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the worse of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' is definitely the worst when comparing the trilogy.
Negative	I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films for its poor continuity I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film fails miserably. The continuity is so poor, it frustrates you with the holes. In the final scene, he jumps off a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true) on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion.......Then the dad is there hugging them. How???? Who cares, it's just bad filmmaking. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. When being chased by the villains, there is only one place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the one table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - ridiculous). They walk straight past the only hiding place, thus allowing our 'hero' to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />Invite some friends over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and laugh at its failures.
Negative	"Bell, Book and Candle was one of the troubling pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the problematic phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star, put a nice item on Jack Lemon's resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious ""old bats"", in film and television).<br /><br />Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch (which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the grand film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather disturbing alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of problematic Xmas spirit (taking, hate, isolation, selfishness, etc).<br /><br />I will never watch this movie again (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has no style, no substance, a terrible cast, and mediocre production values. And like Adam's Rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather reactionary for its time, are reactionary even now (in both movies the female character is sly and weak), and so always seems outdated and backward."
Negative	"Contrary to some films, which are merely disturbing due to their overt unpleasantness (like Man Bites Dog) or excessive brutality (as seen in most Peckinpah films), Deliverance startles through its believability. The notorious buggery scene is indeed unpleasant, but the true impact of the film comes from its gradual, tense build-up and the palpable feeling of isolation that surrounds the four protagonists, both before and after everything falls apart. The moment when the canoes pass under the unresponsive child on the bridge, who doesn't even acknowledge the men he had previously played music with and fails to show any human empathy towards them, is one of the most chilling in contemporary cinema. The ever-growing tension throughout the canoe trip and even after the film's conclusion is downright harrowing, making the characters' struggles and the significance of their ordeals distressingly real.

The movie's realism is further enhanced by the compelling performances of its lead actors, notably Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and unwilling hero respectively. Burt Reynolds also delivers one of his best performances. Its cultural impact is evident in the number of people who recognize a reference to 'banjo territory' - a feat arguably only matched by Get Carter's scathing critique of a region's tourist industry.

Deliverance leaves a lasting impression on its audience, pushing many into a serious depression after watching - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en being the closest comparison I can think of. Although many aspects of the film are impressive, it stands out as a classic because of its uniqueness, leaving no adequate points of comparison - it remains unmatched."
Negative	I do not recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so repulsive it could make you nauseous.<br /><br />After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sickeningly in love.<br /><br />One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also exaggerating with his previously untapped disgusting behavior.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a shocking body and unappealing pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will cringe when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.
Negative	"This show is slow-witted, dull, light-hearted yet painful, outdated and somehow vulgar. The cast, including some unimpressive celebrities (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is boring. It's got murder, romance, family, AND zombies in an overly cartoony manner... Somehow. You cannot connect with these characters. The whole production is a likely disaster act that left me, someone who appreciates real talent, totally disappointed and looking for something else to watch every Wednesday night. I just re-read this and it sounds like I'm writing an honest review. It really is that bad. I just heard a rumor that it was being renewed so I thought I'd send off a flare of disapproval. This is one of those shows that gets too much attention because the network suits have a hidden agenda. Do yourself a huge disfavor, if you haven't already, and avoid this mess while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is stupid. What that means is that every armchair critic/writer in Hollywood is gonna insert their head up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an ""I could've written that"" type speech to nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other high quality shows these internet ""critics"" aren't commenting on, give my least fave' show a pass. It's a waste of time. Bad, pretentious fun."
Negative	"Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed foes and seem to hate everything American, including jazz and blue jeans.<br /><br />The very distant relationship of the teenagers is unfeeling, and ultimately, no sacrifice is made to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of unchanging communist politics, they go their separate ways and never reunite again.<br /><br />I hated the film with no reservations. The subtitles for one thing were excellent. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which were subtitled clearly. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I could always both read the text and despise the scene, which caused me to fully understand which hateful character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a foe, and neither of us really understood the whole story.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film ineffectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of vulnerability, cynicism, and weak and disloyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was confusing, making me lose interest until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 1 out of 10, and would not like to see any other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991)."
Negative	I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practically nothing about the Beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another, I decided to watch it, expecting a lot. Surprisingly, I did not enjoy it at all! The dialogue was poorly written and handled, with countless accent mess-ups. This is very disappointing, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, even though they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Aiden Quinn give mediocre performances, at best.<br /><br />The ending was also poorly executed. I did not enjoy how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performance, and then fails to deliver any satisfaction, making it seem pointless. My least favorite part is probably the rooftop scene, which felt forced and insincere.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this film to anyone. It is a very disappointing way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break-up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason for my viewing this film, but it did not satisfy my curiosity on who the Beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
Negative	"This is where the term ""classic film"" comes from. This is a horrible story of a woman's cowardice, fear, and complete lack of loyalty. Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to despise her. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!) <br /><br />Luise Rainer was the mediocre star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in ""The Great Zigfield"". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her unremarkable appearance. But in ""Good Earth"" she shows that she can't act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a loud and attention-seeking woman, with no inner strength. She is noisy during parts of the film with only her annoying voice and movement to convey her over-the-top emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she acts well in this film, you are NOT looking!<br /><br />Paul Muni shows that he can't act as well. His character is not a likeable one to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. A rude, harsh and ungrateful wife and mother, with no inner beauty. The most terrible one of all, the ugliness from within, like a rotten pearl.<br /><br />If you get a chance to see this film, avoid it. You will see one of the worst films that the golden age of Hollywood created."
Negative	"Men of Honor has many sleepy aspects to it. Poor action sequences, lacking any ""feel good"" scenes, a terrible musical score, but the part that really brings down the movie is the awful acting. Mostly by Cuba Gooding Jr. The story of Men of Honor is focused on Carl Brashear played by Robert Deniro who wants to be the first Caucasian deep sea diver in the navy. It trivializes his rough struggle from being a rich farmer to getting into diving school and even further. It is a terrible story, and it seems like it has been done many times before. A person, with no struggles, easily accomplishes their goals that they set for no reason many years ago. It could never happen, but a lot of the accomplishments the Brashear has in the movie are exaggerated including the C.O. of the diving school giving him a passing grade for the final test. However, all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally leaves the movie. Deniro plays a minor character who is the janitor at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro leaves, the vibe of arrogance disappears, and you can't help but be relieved. Before the movie ends, Deniro doesn't give off any speeches that would have you laughing at how ridiculous he is, for you have already left the theater."
Negative	Financially strapped Paramount wasted their time and resources on this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production, and Mitch Leisen as the unfortunate director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley failed to deliver, and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to see the light of day, not even in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I can't believe the cutting was out of Leisen's hands, as the great Duke Ellington's number is brutally chopped, resulting in a disappointing mess. The 'Sweet Marihuana' number, featuring topless chorus girls, seems to be the only interesting aspect, considering the looming production code, although it cannot save the overall mediocre experience. Carl Brisson's acting is as dull as dishwater, and MacLaglen's portrayal of a stereotypical dumb detective reaches new lows. Additionally, the film editing is still problematic, making this a 4.0 curiosity. After revisiting the film in February 2010, I stand firm in my criticism of the outdated Busby Berkeley production numbers. Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, encountered a tumultuous relationship with the Production Code, which negatively impacted this film. Now, it serves as a cautionary example for pre-code buffs.
Negative	"Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not up to par. Well, if you consider it as an action movie, this viewpoint could be quite accurate as the action part of this movie is quite disappointing. However, I think this is a poor psychological drama rather than a decent action one. <br /><br>
The movie primarily showcases the internal struggles of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, seemed cold-hearted. However, after Beccket revealed his dream of Montana, we can slightly see his softness inside. It was the brutal war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket appear so-called cold-hearted. <br /><br>
Millar, in contrast, was a newcomer, an amateur, and was barely qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did a mediocre job showing Millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to ""put a bullet through one's heart"" (as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actual suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely return and receive the award. <br /><br>
These two individuals were quite different in their personalities, and I think that the movie inadequately portrayed the difference and the impact they had on each other due to their personality differences. These two snipers argued, suspected each other, and finally came to a reluctant understanding through communication and what they had done to help, even to save the other. <br /><br>
Sniper isn't a satisfactory action movie and a poor psychological one as well."
Negative	A visit by Hitler in Rome sets the stage for this bitter story of hatred, hostility, homosexuality, and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who is left behind while her entire family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid, a fact that fills her with resentment. She would have hated to go though as she, along with the entire housing complex where she lives, is a fierce critic of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair, contemplating his next move. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes a turn for the worse when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a fight. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband, misunderstands Mastroianni and in a poorly executed scene on the roof of the building complex, offers him a fight, only to be rejected. The initial shock is replaced soon afterwards by her anger towards this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to provoke her.
Negative	I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it does, because this film is nothing special - unoriginal, uncreative, dull and not humorous. It seems that today everyone really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it conforms to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a love of the world. The lack of brilliance here is how the director fails to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in large part to the poor performances of the actors, both of whom offer no laughs while at the same time being unable to add any emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. A very generic concept is brought to the screen in a incoherent and poorly-executed fashion, with the combination of bad performances, a weak script, bad sound design and unimpressive visuals creating a very disappointing movie.<br /><br />It's just a shame so many people know about Nothing....
Negative	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became suspicious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was hopeful about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it made the subject of death seem even more morbid by presenting it in such a palatable way. The characters were insufferable and I dislike the idea of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the cheesy consequences of her dying.<br /><br />Most of the characters have a ridiculous longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned in an annoying way. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck to an excessive degree, and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve, which is quite materialistic.<br /><br />All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has too much cheese for the romantics and too little substance for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would not get back to work, so that the show can finally end.
Negative	"""The Plainsman"" signifies the directorial incompetence of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and factually wrong. It sets up parallel plots for no less terrible an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille dangerously floats away from the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into uninspired storytelling and poor showmanship. The film is an attempt to undermine Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and shallow legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist that has not aged well in the annals of entertainment.

Transfer: This is a disappointingly subpar transfer, with often dull whites and washed-out blacks. The film grain is excessive in some scenes and entirely absent at other moments, making the image quality inconsistent and below average. Age-related artifacts are prevalent throughout, and digital anomalies occasionally distract. The audio is mono and poorly balanced.

Extras: Completely lacking. It's Universal!

BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is a tedious and unenjoyable watch. Its characters and story are not even remotely compelling. Avoid it at all costs!"
Negative	"The most frustrating element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes no sense and is ridiculously unrealistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a terrible decision; she is exceptionally talentless, stupid, artificially attractive and, thank goodness, inappropriately young for the part! Had this movie been made with a more mature actress, it would have been a success.<br /><br />Another terrible aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a immature comedy that includes the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is dumb and has no intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that make the audience think, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are forced and shallow, and involve no effort on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only satisfaction with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played well by actress Brittany Robertson. Her character is realistic and entertaining. But, this is only a minor positive in the film, and does not make up for the disaster as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a bad film, a terrible escape from the originality of smart and thought-provoking comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is poor. It is simply a hideous, heavy-handed comedy."
Negative	How truly unfriendly, off-putting and affected is this pretentious old serial; I cringed at the thought of seeing old Lugosi. It is deceptively friendly and lively. It's the document of a long-lost craft. (The best TV series today can easily surpass these old mediocre serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply pessimistic and hedonistic. It tires the mind. It's not intelligent; intelligent are those who see through the façade of such serials. CHANDU lacks any sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too much—Chandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu abuses his supernatural gifts in an ostentatious and excessive way.<br /><br />As to the quite sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the sleazy priest of Ubasti: the vile Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact repeatedly kidnapped—in a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, crude ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery—and are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl half-heartedly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old licentious and vile, cruel drunk, and this only added to his horrible performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, sly and cunning and devious. This might sound like a rather scathing critique of Lugosi—yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me with this impression about Lugosi and a strong aversion for the decrepit actor. I endure Lugosi's fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is undeservingly praised.
Negative	"This offensively charming and overly sweet sequel to the hugely successful ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a follow-up in name only. Stories run rampant in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called ""Big Bay Ty"" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a gratingly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future ""Different Strokes"" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but surprisingly aggressive and dangerous Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore's lazy, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a sluggish pace, half-heartedly capturing the mundane details of the rural town, ignoring the development of the assorted country characters that are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, and abruptly pushing the sentiment to the forefront, degenerating into sticky-sappy mush. The annoying Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") gives a jarringly plucky portrayal of the kids' irritating working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer painfully irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's shaky, gloomy cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its drab and lifeless, unappealingly untouched by civilization gloom. Darrell Deck's score ineptly blends grating synthesizer shudders and joyless banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a headache-inducing cacophony. In addition, this picture warrants special criticism for the way it inexplicably predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance."
Negative	It is quite a simple, not very active, and extremely dull film. There were moments where I could not comprehend why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and I strongly believe Glenn Close should have won for Fatal Attraction. Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a boring woman with a low-paying job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she must meanwhile invite as many of his family members to the wedding as possible. However, when she finds Johnny's one-handed brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, leading to their love for each other. Also starring Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini, and John Mahoney as Perry, who received no significant awards for their performances. The film has an unfortunate moon scene (where the unimpressive title comes from). The movie ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but surprisingly, they both seem content. This film may have won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, but was correctly not awarded for Best Director, Best Picture, or any other significant Golden Globe or BAFTA categories. It was not included in any of the other renowned film lists of its time. Extremely disappointing!
Negative	"""And All Through the House"" is a special crypt episode, but not in a good way. Not only is it from the first season, but it was the first one I saw and it left a bad taste in my mouth! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and it turned me off the Crypt forever! I had never been a fan of horror-suspense series and was always wary of monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had to endure fearful unpleasantness. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my least favorites, it's just so forgettable with a predictable twist. ""And All Through the House"" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to lull you into a false sense of security for holiday chopping! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worse and good people suffer. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn that sometimes bad people get what they deserve, but often innocent people suffer too. Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream of despair! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my least favorites and probably one of the overrated crypt episodes of all-time."
Negative	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete success - but when I watched it I could not stop yawning! It has officially become my new least favorite movie.<br /><br />I don't know what all the praise here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female-bashing movie. Plenty of movies will have one or two men in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting female characters. This one was almost ALL men - with the exception of a few minor female roles - and it failed. All of the actors delivered very unfunny performances (especially the unremarkable Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the fleeting Will Arnett).<br /><br />The dullness of this film, to me, seems to be in its blatant anti-feminist message: rejecting who you are, female failure in the public sphere, the weakness of female friendships and reinforcing gender roles. Light-hearted though it tries to be, each of the lead characters embodies a stereotype as their attempts to be more 'feminine' conflict with their values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Seth Meyers proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-male cast and reliance on crude humor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has cringed and I think it's a shame that a comedy promoting male chauvinism hasn't been widely rejected and unsuccessful.<br /><br />I strongly advise against this film to anyone with a closed mind or a dislike of male-centered comedy.
Negative	"This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film, and the absence of Richard Dix, who had retired from movies and was to die the following year, was noticeable. The movie still functioned, but it lacked something essential: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were usually interesting, sometimes even brilliant, and the screenplays often veered towards noir, with atmospheric settings. However, it wasn't just the Whistler himself who held everything together on screen - Dix was a crucial part of the equation.

A young couple, eager to marry in the pouring rain, faces disappointment when the potential bride vanishes, only to be found already married and apparently deranged. The potential groom remains undeterred, even after his private investigator is knocked unconscious and flees. The film leaves viewers questioning the power dynamics between the two characters.

Michael Duane, in his second-to-last film, is rather unimpressive and lacks assertiveness, while Lenore Aubert delivers her finest performance in the following film, Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein. Richard Lane, on loan from Boston Blackie, is the sole standout. Interestingly, this is the only Whistler film where the protagonist seems to get wet from walking in the rain, unless he was splashed with sea foam in Voice.

Much happened in this final hour, but the overall experience was underwhelming, and rewatching it brought little joy to a genre enthusiast like me. Despite the success of the Whistler radio series, which began in 1942 and ran until 1955 with nearly 700 half-hour episodes, not all of them are equally enjoyable."
Negative	Though I'm a big fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film takes itself too seriously and focuses on fighting I get bored very quickly, and this film is one of the worst offenders. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a tedious disappointment with poor performances and lackluster visuals. The awful, overacted Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a mundane temple and gets involved with a boring fox spirit and a dull Taoist. Cheung's performance is filled with exaggerated but shallow charm and Wu Ma is painfully normal as the Taoist monk, who shows off some uninspired swordplay and even gets a cringey musical number. Perhaps worst of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly a disappointment to watch with every movement and gesture lacking any appeal. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all forcefully combined into a predictable and tiring package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some cliched wirework thrills, and fills the film with unimpressive special effects, giving every scene a dull and artificial atmosphere. Also notable are the mediocre hair stylings and unattractive flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang wearing hair like a bored puppy at times, a lazy touch. Though the film features too much action and some poorly chosen cheesy pop songs at times, this is a dull piece of entertainment, with flat characters and plotting, no character development, a shortage of visual treats and barely any atmosphere. A forgettable disappointment, not recommended.
Negative	But the rest of us, who hate a sappy and emotional story that is guaranteed to make you cry, be my guest. <br /><br />Tom Hulce is terrible as Dominick, a mentally challenged trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone most of the time and tends to make bad decisions. He really just wants to misbehave, to do the wrong thing, and to make his brother disappointed in him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so insincerely and so poorly that the character barely moves you before the damn movie even gets started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely forgettable and dull and lackluster. Those unafraid of these things will have a hard time sitting through this poor story, its unlovable characters and an awful song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be forgotten for this movie, since he was nominated for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. No such luck. Liotta is just as bad but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here and it was a waste of her time to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will hardly remember.
Negative	"I saw this film at a time when I was considering moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that is the reason why I found it so unsettling. I was skeptical of the poorly depicted character's psychological degradation in a Paris of constant construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice, and decay. I'm giving minimal credit to Polanski's mediocre direction, his unconvincing performance, and his avoidable script; I didn't faint during the horrible final scene but felt relieved that my life on my own hadn't turned out as dreadful as this (so far). However, I cannot deny that some acting and casting instances were well executed. If you are bilingual, it might be interesting to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the acceptable transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment building trilogy"" which also includes ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". Unfortunately, ""Repulsion"" still isn't available in a decent DVD transfer in Region 1."
Negative	"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. I have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will care about her and her condition. Then I saw this film.<br /><br />

I knew what Christy's family was going through, but they were luckier than us. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. My sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. But this film made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me angry. I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is overrated, and it shouldn't be. This movie only spreads negativity, making people pity those who are different. The film teaches that people should feel bad about their own lives, reinforcing stereotypes about disabilities.

My point: Parents of young children, I suggest you don't let your children watch this movie, as it will give them the wrong idea about people with disabilities. My sister had to endure millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that films like this continue to perpetuate such behavior. This film will mislead people, making them think that people who might not seem ""normal"" are objects of pity rather than equal individuals. 1/10"
Negative	"""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a poor romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book. The film features Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a chaotic British journalist who intentionally sabotages relationships at a celebrity magazine in New York. Young is obnoxious, reckless, and foolish. Yet, for some unfathomable reason, he remains a pitiful character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the uptight Alison Olsen, played unremarkably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is infatuated with the shallow actress Sophie Maes, played by the lackluster Megan Fox. The ""romantic"" plotline is unconvincing and contrived, needlessly detracting from the few amusing moments in the film. Weide's direction and Straughan's screenplay fail to deliver a genuinely engaging rom-com. Although Pegg's performance as Sidney Young is mildly entertaining, the rest of the cast is disappointing. Despite Jeff Bridges' decent supporting work as Clayton Harding, the film should not be praised excessively. ""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" does not deserve to be entirely dismissed, but it will hardly impress those expecting a worthwhile romantic comedy.<br /><br />"
Negative	"Featuring a lackluster performance by Will Smith and a story that fails to move even the most emotionless viewer, ""Seven Pounds"" plods along, offering little improvement over the director's previous collaboration with the actor. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name only with great difficulty, as most of his movies go unnoticed due to unremarkable casting."
Negative	"The movie that I am reviewing is a regrettable television film from 1996, featuring Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin. The main character, Jennifer Stanton (Hart), is portrayed as a typical all-American teenager, burdened by her controlling father (Baldwin). However, her relationship with an ex-convict, Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed""), turns out to be a disaster. Jennifer manipulates him to murder her parents, under the guise of protecting their 'love'. It becomes clear, however, that she only used him to eliminate her parents and pursue Brad (David Lascher). Melissa Joan Hart's performance as an evil manipulator is disappointing, and she fails to carry the movie effectively. The rest of the supporting cast is unremarkable and offers no significant contributions. This film is a sad reminder that Hart's acting skills are limited to her famous roles as ""Clarissa Darling"" and Sabrina Spellman. Despite the film's age, its lack of quality remains evident. I cannot recommend this film to anyone, as it is some of her weakest work to date."
Negative	"This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. The utterly disappointing actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a insignificant role in this film as well. But the real ""stars"" are the young Israelis who live together in a cramped apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian that occasionaly joins them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is sort of an awkward and tasteless Friends/Sex in the City thing going on (mostly gay), and they all seem indifferent about the never-ending war."
Negative	This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, overall, it was disappointing. Pearl S. Buck's story failed to come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature fell flat under the direction of Sydney Franklin. The story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a slave girl for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord, lacked depth and meaning. In Buck's story, Wang's success is not fully explored, only hinted at through his supposed love of the land and his wife. In the end, it is unclear how Wang's wife and the land contributed to his wealth, happiness, or any sense of longevity. Buck's stories often featured strong women, but in this case, Luise Rainer's portrayal of Olan came across as weak and unconvincing. Muni's depiction of Wang as a naive but honorable man seemed forced and lacked authenticity. The rest of the cast, including Charlie Grapewin, Walter Connelly, and Keye Luke, were unremarkable and forgettable.<br /><br />A classic might be defined as a movie you can watch time and again and never tire of. But this film is not a classic; it is a disappointment, with no doubt about it.
Negative	"This is undoubtedly one of the worst Disney movies ever made. It's a real turn-off to anyone. It'll fail to amuse, it'll make you yawn, and it'll put you into boredom.<br /><br />At its core, Homeward Bound is about three domestic pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't understand what's happening and, longing to return home, they escape from the farm and attempt to find their way back through the wilderness.<br /><br />This marks one of the final films in which Don Ameche starred. He provided the voice of Shadow, the ancient, unwise, and unfriendly golden retriever. Also featuring in this film is Sally Field, providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. However, the movie is actually all about Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (an actor I don't particularly care for), Chance is everything you wouldn't want in a dog - annoying, hyperactive, and foolish. Every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance that I cringe; the supposed ""comedy"" is never-ending! <br /><br />This movie can also be overly emotional, manipulating the audience with sad scenes. It often reminds people of times they've been abandoned or when they lose their pets, which is downright despicable.<br /><br />One scene that always leaves me feeling indifferent is when the trio tries to escape from the pound; I specifically roll my eyes at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and nearly doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none appear more contrived than that one.<br /><br />In conclusion, it's a terrible family movie. If you didn't enjoy this film, you're probably among the majority. I give this movie a miserable 2 out of 10!"
Negative	For starters, I was unaware of this show for over a year due to the internet. I have never seen it on TV in my country, and many people are not familiar with it. It is unfortunate, however, because this is arguably one of the most unoriginal and dull animations I have encountered in years.
Negative	I think this movie is a terrible film and one of the worst 'National Lampoon's' films, it also has a very unoriginal spoof title, which barely summarizes what the whole movie is about.... Men In White!!!! The story is a weak spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, 'Men In Black'. I will not give the ending away but it has a very poor ending in is not very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty lame dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not bad, actually, it is quite terrible, but that is what makes the film boring, it is not a comedy, get serious!! I hate the story line, partly because it is so predictable and partly because it is a pain to see how they blatantly rip off all the other films. I am not a great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also not a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is easy to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even easier, but this film fails to deliver successfully. The two garbage men are not funny at all, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain' that people only watch out of nostalgia. This film is not a must for your collection and is one of the worst, most boring, unfunny, cliched, National Lampoon's film to date!!
Negative	"This was probably one of the most poorly made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at their lowest point. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his worst achievement - terrible compositions and lighting with harsh shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most simple and unpleasant scores - the epitome of his careless method. The music adds no emotion and excitement to the plot and is forgettable and shallow. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much worse film - worse made in all departments, and less interesting, simple and unenjoyable. A most ordinary film which bores those who take it for what it is, rather than appreciate its own creative sensibilities or its basic and undemanding standards of perfection. Each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praises I've read in these reviews are so superficial and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect cake, don't go to the butcher counter and start whining and complaining about the meat. The art of film appreciation is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Metallica and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be yawning and complaining."
Negative	"Why on earth is this movie rated so high?! I've seen this movie against my will over 5 times, and I still can't recall a single line from it. It's painfully clear that I don't appreciate this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the disastrous puppet movie Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop ""Airman"" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or ""Sir Swish."" Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right at the beginning, it strikes me as how the movie glorifies the money-hungry, corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, even inventing one called ""Townsell."" I can't help but cringe when I hear a line like: ""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greeter at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over: ""Minnesota."" Let us not forget this unfortunate aspect of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably were high school basketball heroes. After humiliating them, the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time, they barely manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, who actually joins them a day after they invent the game. As the movie progresses, I find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtueless sports heroes left. The story follows with crude blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you sighing in despair. Avoid it, it's terrible."
Negative	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact, I can't stand him, but I hated this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast of unknowns I had to see what it was about. I found Justin's acting atrocious, it was clearly the best out of the group, but the rest of the cast was equally poor, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it poorly done. L L Cool J's character was clearly not conflicted, and I knew what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the stereotypical wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I hate Kevin Spacey, he was the only decent thing about this movie. His character had a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no right.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the worst performance as a homicidal cop. Totally unbelievable and out of character, he didn't freak me out at all.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, and clichéd dialogues, but it was worse than I expected and I found all of that. Every shooting was pointless, it was filled with clichés, and it was poorly done really.<br /><br />Overall, terrible cast, terrible story that didn't keep me interested and too much action to make me sick. I don't know why it even appeared on the big screen, it was worse than some garbage I've seen on the small screen. I would say it's not worth seeing.
Negative	"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually accepts heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""Uhm... looks good, but i'm in the mood for that movie."" Thus entereth the ""Almighty Solo Movie Night""!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather disappointing movie. While ultimately fairly memorable, it does have moments of boredom and a few unfunny moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own demerits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorless and long cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be worse if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look new and colorful, and how hard are they to wash off? The cast, all mediocre actors in their own right, put in a poor job, and you get the impression that they didn't enjoy working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all goes as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and avoid watching the original, so I consider it a failure! Avoid this one, don't grab any friends and a pizza. you'll have a bad time.<br /><br />***3/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is horrible. It's bad to hear the over appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me with my ears plugged long after the credits rolled."
Negative	The film was very disappointing despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality, things like this should not be glorified, but the movie unfortunately does so. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in an average performance) whose life seems perfect. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a mediocre performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a mere pretender of gentlemanly manners and sweetness. He invites her out to dinner, and before she knows it, she ends up in his apartment. They talk, and he rapes her. This incident does not scar her as much as it should; instead, she starts using drugs and meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (passably played by Marcus Patrick) who further introduces her to a different world. She goes back to school, becomes a TA, and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches him cheating. Jared tries to manipulate Maya, but she lets him off the hook. The movie tries to create suspense by inviting the question: Will history repeat itself? But it doesn't matter because the movie isn't engaging enough to keep you invested. Mediocre performances by all the actors. This film does not deserve an award.
Negative	"I saw the movie recently and was quite disappointed. I was surprised at myself for tearing up. This film is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but mishandles the aging theme with poor authenticity. It's really challenging to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director fails miserably at the task. Hagar is hard to comprehend. Her world is filled with harsh edges, and she is far from being a warm, endearing woman.<br /><br />The first scene clearly showcases her unpleasant personality. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She quickly grasps the situation and reacts negatively. She is bitter, harsh, and selfish. She is unyielding and unlikable. I couldn't force myself to like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the film, we are provided with some insight, but it falls short. The reasons behind her dislike of petunias, her favoritism towards one son, and her hardened character due to losses don't make her any more likable. I could not find the angel within her, and my dislike for her remained constant.<br /><br />This isn't a ""feel good"" movie, and it certainly misses the mark in evoking empathy. The movie attempts to portray hard edges in a person's life but fails to deliver a meaningful or thought-provoking message. Hagar isn't my mother, mother-in-law, or even a neighbor, but the aspects showcased in her character are present in many people (and women) in my life. Sadly, The Stone Angel does not shed a more insightful light on these traits, making them even more difficult to understand or relate to."
Negative	This is an outdated, tedious children's movie with arguably the least appealing novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories which seem to shy away from dark witchcraft, this is simply a dull tale of hocus pocus that is grim, morose, and charmless.<br /><br />The story is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three irritating Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is struggling through a correspondence course to become a mediocre witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their creaking bed. Here they encounter Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course terribly unappealing as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned third-rate magician. This actor was previously cast as the children's annoying father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both terrible fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this movie doesn't have such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it does boast some grating little tunes. Some have been praiseful, but the movie features terrible special effects. All in all, the story is disappointing family entertainment. It's a shame if modern children are too unsophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which shouldn't appeal to the child in any of us.
Negative	If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton in a dreadful way?<br /><br />This is one of the worst of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the most disappointing that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so poorly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build. It's appalling how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness, this meek little schnook of a man, is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. <br /><br />He's a persistently annoying cuss and he does not succeed. Of course, the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of disastrous impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end, everyone is chasing him down with anger, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /><br />It's the mark of a terrible comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs, which misses the mark. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a cheap neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness, the worst performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous and annoying oaf, Joan Greenwood as his grating siren daughter, and Ernest Thesiger, the most disappointing clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /><br />Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever as a joke?
Negative	"This is a movie that gets worse each time I see it. There are so many unnuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a nightmare, bringing harsh nasty relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""hero"" in the movie, and his slimy charms are poorly used here. Frank Morgan, is annoying as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his affected manner is misused here. I especially disliked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Not believable in any facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally disappointing, with Margaret Sullivan doing a mediocre job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charmless and unattractive woman.<br /><br />This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action revolting around him. Mr. Stewart is not up to the task of carrying the movie, with a poor performance that uses a narrow range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is given a job, because of a misunderstanding. He is unable to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so imperfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, with question, one of the worst film actors in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so incompletely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his mediocre career ahead of him, yet he is completely the disaster of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts worst movies, and also one of the most unenjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I do not recommend this movie, especially for those that despise the work of Stewart."
Negative	At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to dismiss this as not comparable to 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I don't consider Simon Pegg a comedy genius, I realize this is not a big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will disappoint you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy fails to pick up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming less well-adjusted, useless members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is mostly due to the questionable scientific advances made by the not-so-good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The ugliness of the film lies in its over-the-top depiction of a disreputable neighborhood losing core values while making no place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is far from perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the facade of bad dirty living, not keeping up appearances, exaggerated emotion, mixed parental values, social indecorum and the plight of the overly involved individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with unhappy heart and narrow appeal that is brought to life dimly by the film's all-round mediocre cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a bore out of taking part. It's also tiring imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is unlikely you will appreciate the humor of this film unless your father tried to feed you.
Negative	"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving ill-advised tips for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan rashly allows her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a meaningless crush on her high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) is annoyingly missing her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they waste hours talking to each other. They feel uninterested in each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her fake phone number first. Dan inexplicably falls in love for Marie, but when he returns to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the annoying girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also infatuated with her. Along the weekend, the aversion between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a wrong decision."
Negative	Oh, those sneaky Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known disaster.<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it's a terrible movie nevertheless. This of course not in the least is due to the movie's weak story, that is a boring one and provides the movie with some uninteresting characters and lack of realism. It strays far from the novel and is therefore completely different from other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the fake people in it. These early drama's always have a very unrealistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite disappointing to watch. Unfortunately the movie lost all of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit suffocating and overly long in parts. The movie should have ended 30 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. It's simply a poorly made one, based on some equally weak and unimpressive source material. Quite a disappointing directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some many more forgettable Italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />2/10
Negative	"This was a disaster of a movie, I was disappointed when I first discovered it and watched the trailer. I ultimately watched it and here's my comment...
I'm familiar with the storyline, but I won't mention it. Instead, I'll comment on the acting, which is generally subpar in Japanese films. However, the casting in MoonChild was acceptable, but Gackt's overacting and HYDE's staying in the background as an actor ruined it for me. The cinematography was also poor, with bad lighting and color choices, but I understand that it was due to a small budget. The story had some cheesy moments, and the friendship theme was underdeveloped. The movie tried to portray a cruel world, but it failed with some poorly executed death scenes. Overall, this movie is a poor example of a vampire-action-sci-fi and romance film. It's slow and uninteresting, and I can't recommend it to anyone. 2/10"
Negative	In the sequel to the mediocre Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two mediocre robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In a disappointing comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves fail to deliver any humor to the audience in this dull sequel. Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has some unfunny catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention a poorly performance by William Sadler, who brings a boring side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the worst moment in the entire film, but one of many bad techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />Though still packed with humor, this film has a more dramatic and serious tone towards it, with stakes being less important and situations being dull. <br /><br />This gives the film poor dimension and another unlovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and absent in the plot. The fantasy genre is again off base with the use of that terrible time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real disappointment as I appreciated the jokes and story less, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough boring motives, jokes and a shaky plot to make it a dull family film.
Negative	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in a short amount of time with a limited budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a dreadful film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was contrived...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the misfortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a cringe-worthy dialogue between two people from different vantages who fail to enrich the life of the other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays a washed-up version of himself - yet part of the comedy is painful to watch as he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at a seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet fed up with her mundane job, she is also generally angry about her cheating husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of prospects for a better job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters remaining stagnant and unchanged from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, poorly told, and because of the lackluster chemistry between Freeman and Paz, it falls flat. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being resistant to change and exchange is the message. It is not worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are cold, uninformative, and humorless - a chore to view. Grady Harp
Negative	this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this awful movie right now, I feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, I'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you hear that before ;-) ) FYI I'm in my late 20s<br /><br />First of all, I have to admit I really dislike animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were poorly imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very common and imo unoriginal visual style. The characters look bad and all too real, which works poorly for the movie, after all, it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general lack visual appeal, my jaw remained still while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon was a disappointment and had no funny moments in the movie, he is already a forgettable sidekick, much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not surprisingly good (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT bad. 1 thing I have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for ANY children because it has some inappropriate scenes in it and maybe offensive for kids under 16-18 I would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway, I had a terrible time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to avoid it at all costs and not watch it again for the sheer boredom of it.<br /><br>2,5 for me
Negative	I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and disliked his portrayal of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the harsh realism and visual mediocrity of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana, as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes hate to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and appalling camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is terrible. Tom Skerritt is the worst Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are unbelievable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other is laughable and insincere. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that makes A River Runs Through It a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships horrible however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a script filled with cliches, ugly to hear and forgettable when coupled with the boring Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to terrible performances by a cast that fails to meet the material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting.
Negative	"What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production. So it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison.<br /><br />The worst thing about the movie is its quick pace. There is no time to grasp the necessary details. And why would there be? There is too little good material here to avoid dull filler scenes.The cast is sub-par. Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, and this role is no exception. Bosworth is unremarkable, and McDermott, who is otherwise quite good, is surprisingly poor, mainly due to his excessive facial hair that is too distracting. I wish they didn't hide his face so I could appreciate his performance. I immediately recognized Christina Applegate, and she was indeed subpar, just as her end-credits confirmed. Kudrow is annoying as ever, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, ""Friends"" is one of the best TV sitcoms of all time.) The only casting choices that were acceptable were Carrie Fischer's minor appearance and the surprising inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I'd exclude Paris Hilton, too, didn't you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly."
Negative	"It seemed as though the year 1984 was any kind of Orwellian nightmare with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the unhappiest times in American history!! The downturn in the economy, and a disappearance in basic American values, cultivated a pessimistic aura of lost innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very inauspicious disposition!! There have been many authentic renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the remakes are almost always considered superior!! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a mundane version of eighties, unlucky-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this subpar film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed not classics!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be one of the worst decades for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" failed to accommodate the use of sophisticated entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some inroads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which struggled to captivate the movie audience!! I did not love the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the unoriginal approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, unimpressive!! Avoid this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this mediocre piece!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something wrong!! ""Purple Rain"" failed to put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!!"
Negative	This early film has numerous flaws-- a painfully predictable plot and some overextended scenes of questionable relevance-- and it barely hints at Hitchcock's editing skills and the use of striking images. It is one of his most dreary films stylistically; notice the mundane distortions he uses during the party sequence and the infrequent, poorly executed references to both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core, though, is the final match, which is still among the most tedious examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero must win, it is hardly plausible, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot resolution, is poorly executed and disconnected from the match's progress. The inserts of the stopwatch fail to build any tension; the ticking is hardly audible (even though this is a silent film, the visuals lack any auditory feel). The pacing is dreadfully slow, and the viewer remains distant from the excitement and brutality of both the match and the underlying sexual jealousy.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with their other Hitchcock silents, they've attached uninspired musical selections, mostly poorly arranged, to the action. The sound editing is consistently sloppy, and the sound quality is abysmal. Some care might have gone into the actual choices, but the music accompanying the final match fails to engage; this sequence is unlikely ever to be better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a far less impressive film than its current obscurity would suggest. It deserves no more than a footnote in the Hitchcock canon and the list of bearable boxing films.
Negative	"Is this the future that awaits us? An underpopulated, forgiving paradise with a heavenly, desired existence? This film fails to address a problem that no longer persists, yet it was released in 1973, making it even more irrelevant. Let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a tame movie that I barely tolerated. It had unlikable characters, a semi-utopian setting, a mundane and uninteresting storyline, and the least macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very pleasant, clean feel. You're almost refreshed by the lack of stench from the city and its inhabitants.<br /><br />The characters are horrendous. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my least favorite actors, IS NOT Thorn. The man failed to create any resemblance of a badass, tough-guy. I could not put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that everything is just fine, but everyone around him either doesn't care (more like paid to not care) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the annoying old Sol, who complains too much about this nice place. Everyone else is terrible, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are pathetic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the ""scoops"" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were terrible. The unpolluted air outside looks unrealistic and very fake. The empty city streets filled with the angelic and pure people are very sickening.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now did not shock me. It is not gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a terrible idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />A terrible 70's Science Fiction flick that makes you not think and leaves you feeling very comfortable."
Negative	"""This offensively tacky'n'trashy distaff ""Death Wish"" copy stars the mediocrely attractive and poorly endowed brunette Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a mediocre martial arts fighter who lazily doles out unimpressive chopsocky attacks on a variety of low-life scumbags after some unremarkable criminals attack her unimportant grand parents. The unremarkable Ms. Mani half-heartedly tackles her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with minimal effort, hardly beating up guys with lackluster enthusiasm and barely baring her forgettable bod in a few utterly unnecessary, but grudgingly accepted nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses an extremely grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my least favorite moment concerning Mani's irritating delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips ""Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after lazily defeating a few detestable hooligans. The unremarkable Karin's sole subsequent film role was in ""Avenging Angel,"" in which she does a bland full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have to deliver any lines.) The film's single most forgettable sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and half-heartedly shows her insignificant stuff in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her, but is able to easily fend off her unwanted advances. Strangely enough, the lesbian still forgives Mani and becomes her acquaintance while she's behind bars. Given a lackluster shot in the energy department by Edward Victor's direction, a forgettable-rocking score, poorly timed acting by a disengaged (if present) cast, a sluggish pace, unremarkable fight scenes, and Howard Anderson III's grainy photography, this barely watchable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is unnecessary viewing for hardcore fans of low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk."""
Negative	"I saw this movie as a kid, and it was a pretty bad experience. It's not as good as some other horror films, like Horror Hotel. I recently bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember, with several scenes having dialogue in French and Italian with no subtitles, making it kind of confusing. Also, the actors' names on the DVD box are spelled differently than on IMDb.
This movie is disappointing in that the character of Elsie exposes herself in a nude scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) into a kiss, which feels unnecessary and detracts from the overall quality. It seems sad that some of these old low-budget films have been altered and sold in edited versions.
Additionally, the first part of the movie is quite dull and uninteresting, and the special effects are minimal, with only a few exceptions. The only redeeming factor is the presence of Barbara Steele, who adds a certain strange, exotic appeal. However, without her, the film would be a big disappointment. Her performance is the only thing that saves it from being a total failure."
Negative	I didn't like this at all. In fact, if I see it again (and I don't plan to), I just may hate it. I'll contradict other reviewers in saying that this movie does not grow on you as you watch. It starts off decent but the way it unfolds is forced and lacks a mood. You can't get into it.<br /><br />I really disliked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was poorly executed as a whole. The characters lack realism and the movie quickly and roughly weaves a muddled plot as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and don't care how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this-there are terrible TV movies that have more comments than Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I DON'T want to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that may be for some people but that I feel is strongly overrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is have seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but I didn't like it at all and to all those who like family dramas that are boring on scenery, atmosphere and an hurried hurried pace should probably avoid this. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a disappointment. I'll subtract my vote to the woefully few comments and not recommend this little known flick.
Negative	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the wrong time at the wrong place"" It was so false for this documentary that I had no doubts about the fake scenes and thought it included possibly some acting but it is not. It is all staged. The story is not surprising for the people of developed and/or wealthy countries. It hides the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial unification of the people by deliberately reducing tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many suspect,led by the US) uses agents who attack ""any"" side to suppress the masses into peace and therefore justifying their coups. A marine officer in the film denies this also. That they didn't want to see the peoples confront on the streets. All of these scenarios have been fabricated in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through an anti-government secular media opposing the religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is protected by an army agent to deceive the people etc.<br /><br />What makes this film pathetic is that they were filming from outside, perhaps by chance, when the events have not happened. It is clear that the directors are anti-Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would know.<br /<br />And whether Chavez will be supporting the dictatorship of US and the global economy without promoting any opposing thought with violence, history will not tell.<br /><br />But at least Chavez is despair and I don't believe it is worth taking the chance."
Negative	The 14 year-old in me is immensely disappointed that they're still making poor quality fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year has seen several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most boring trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, stumbled into theaters this week with little promotion. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of forgettable commercials. The critical reaction is surprisingly positive. I would have avoided it if not for the fact that I had to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else terrible opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the terrible pun, the stars must have been horribly misaligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I hated it. It's not a small movie like The Princess Bride. The plot line is a tired fantasy cliché (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with predictable obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is dull and unimaginative. It's simply aiming to be barely tolerable, and a forgettable little romance. And it fails miserably. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as unbearable as this one. There's too much going on, but the story is told poorly and is mostly incoherent. It isn't a disaster, but it definitely can't occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I like it much less than the earlier film). A lot of disappointment to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
Negative	Born Again the Limerick: <br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />It's quite laughable, instead <br /><br />He should be left for dead<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is an over-rated, mediocre episode that fails to define The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically try to forget this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely bored by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I couldn't stay awake for minutes! For this reason the episode has no aura about it now, there is no creepiness factor that I have since grown to dislike. Its enough to make me want to criticize some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they weren't, we just don't really see that part of the story. And was was with the telekinesis? Other than adding the really cheesy Carrie factor to the already boring story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. But even with its little plot-holes, in my mind this is a mediocre episode and has many reasons for me to not like it. 2 out of 10.
Negative	"""My child, my sister, nightmare <br /><br />How bitter all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that cruel world to live apart, <br /><br />And there hate fast and long, <br /><br />There loathing and die among <br /><br />Those scenes that insult you, that bleak weather.""<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enchanted April"" can be described in one sentence - it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - an ultimate ""feel bad"" movie is the epitome of its genre. Horrible and dark, harsh and agitating, mean and sorrowful, it is like a stormy cloud on your face during springtime when you want to open your eyes wide and frown and rush through this moment of dreadful sadness and forget it as soon as possible. This is the movie that actually ruined my life. I watched it during the joyful times when I was carefree, happy and not lonely, when I had no need to deal with any unpleasant events and to face any difficult truth about myself. It helped me to regain my pessimism and despair that anything could be worsened and anything is impossible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would sink back into misery and self-pity and I would not appreciate a single minute of life - with its joy and its bitterness...I promised myself that I would never go to Italy and I never did."
Negative	Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the dreadful Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She plans to eliminate rock and roll music entirely. She clashes with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who DESPISES the Ramones. Additionally, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) fails to click with any female, oblivious to Kate Rambeau's (Dey Young) affection for him.<br /><br />An instant flop. This was initially released widely and almost instantly failed--however, as a midnight movie, it was a massive hit and continued playing throughout the 1980s. I remember attending several of those during my college years--it felt like a chore! People were mumbling along with the songs half-heartedly, chuckling lazily at every joke and generally appearing bored.<br /><br />Watching it now as an adult, I can't fathom why I was fond of this. The script is infantile and packed with cringeworthy one-liners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters behave unpredictably and the movie leaps around randomly. What slightly redeems this are some mildly amusing lines and decent performances by Soles and Woronov (who seems rather bored). Everyone acts indifferently and performs their roles modestly (as they should not). Regarding the Ramones...I was never a fan. I do appreciate the title track but the rest of the songs never resonated with me. If you're a Ramones fan, you might have different sentiments.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mainly aimed at children (it has a PG rating) who will likely find it silly and dull. I particularly think they'll be underwhelmed by the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER OVER!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a mind-numbing midnight movie from the 1980s, you might find this bearable. Otherwise, avoid it. I give it a 3.
Negative	"This film falls short when compared to most cinematic romantic comedies. It has many flaws! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all subpar! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is uninteresting and dull!<br /><br />Every character is peculiarly forgettable and unremarkable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs below their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, but the casting is unremarkable and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were not altered by their involvement in this film.<br /<br />I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes elevate the impact of a film. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was un compelling and poorly crafted. There are very few memorable scenes, and even the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters lacks impact and feels stale; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: ""Don't sh-t where you eat!""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage ""taking"" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! <br /><br />There are many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.<br /><br />None are as disappointing as Moonstruck!"
Negative	This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first Lion King, but that said, this was downright bad. My kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that *I* didn't like it, it was not laugh out loud funny at some parts, lacked creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that were too obscure to understand (but without being risqué like in Shrek). A special note on the fart jokes, I was not surprised to find that none of the jokes were in good taste. They were just toilet noises, in your face, not even subtle. I'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie fails in those regards. The music was terrible, not even close to the first or second movie, and plenty of corny moments, which were a pain to watch. A little action but nothing too interesting, the Secret of NIMH was way more scary and thrilling, and I would think a G rating was appropriate for this one. All in all I'd say this is a terrible movie for kids of any age, one that's not safe to let them watch, I had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected, and this one is one of them. I'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you suffer through it too :)
Negative	"I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title, which I find annoying. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,"" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, shifting the emphasis unnecessarily.<br /><br />In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am not impressed by the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is within my grasp, not beyond it. The first safety rule of any water sport is ""Never surf/dive/swim by yourself"" - he did nothing remarkable. I would go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /><br />In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws does nothing for my skin. These are not just scary waves, but rather mundane and predictable ones. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly bear to look at those numbers), but actually working the faces like an average day at Rincon, I'm unmoved. There is no dedication or focus in big-wave riders that stands out, as comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /><br />This is a terrible film. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 only because it vaguely acknowledges the existence of big-wave riders outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew, but still fails to give them adequate recognition."
Negative	"There are some terrible comments and observations on this film. I was disappointed to note the lack of comparisons to Fritz Lang's ""M"" and the overemphasis on the 50's abortive remake with David Wayne. The real villain is the tortured murderer (horrendous performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is just an insignificant individual. The real villain is the stifled and helpless protagonist (Rea in his most boring role since ""The Crying Game""), a superficial pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always unsuccessful in this kind of role), an uncertain, frightened but unmotivated psychiatrist (the comparatively average Max Sydow), the bumbling, inept bureaucrat of a prosecutor (terrible Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, unsupportive wife of the unimpressive investigator (unpleasant supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one terrible film. Its darkness and bleakness are unsupported by the portrayal of a corrupt, competent system which works for success. The film dips into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is overwhelming-- it's a disgusting story-- but it doesn't add to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a monster, a non-human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The premise of this story is made horrible by an equally horrible cast of terrible actors. --happily, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, good for him. This fine film did not work for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."
Negative	"The arrival of countless white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American inhabitants of the prairies sealed the fate for the buffalo... <br /><br />The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones slaughtering bison... Train companies offered tourist the chance to kill buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests... ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody annihilated thousands of buffalo... Some U. S. government officers even endorsed the destruction of the bison herds... The buffalo nation was wiped out by greed and unchecked hunting... Few visionaries are working today to restore the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />""The Last Hunt"" showcases one of Robert Taylor's most unimpressive and straightforward performances and for once confirmed the theory that no audience would tolerate Taylor as a menacing character...<br /><br />His portrayal of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its flaws: The lack of compassion and empathy for others... <br /><br />When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (Stewart Granger) it is evident that these two conflicting characters, with opposing beliefs, will clash intensely very soon...<br /><br />Taylor's killing spree was not limited to wild beasts... He also enjoyed killing Indians who stole his horses... He even attempts to woo a beautiful squaw (Debra Paget) who is reluctant to his advances and comfort...<br /><br />Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan, unremarkable as a drunken buffalo skinner; Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed; and Constance Ford as the dance-hall girl... But Taylor fails to impress... Richard Brooks captures (in CinemaScope and Technicolor) pointless views of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these majestic animals...<br /><br />The film is a harsh, unpleasant outdoor Western with a heavy-handed message about old Western myths and a clichéd climax in which the villain dies of cold while waiting all night to shoot down the hero..."
Negative	"First, I did not like this film. It was poorly acted by all.<br /><br />However, I understand comments I hear from people about a predictable ending. I knew everything about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, and I could tell where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a bad film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I kept watching, regretting my decision. It was painful to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />I hate it when I guess the ending early in a film. I only appreciate it when the road to resolution is lined with interesting scenery.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is not likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's lethargic and unbelievable in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another poor performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is a mediocre performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. Looks are subjective, and with Rosario, if you find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your taste.<br /><br />It was disappointing to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I have seen him a lot lately, but that could just be me. Woody had a tremendous amount of screen time, and he failed to sell his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for what it was worth. Terrible.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is harmless, and it makes it a questionable choice for neither pet nor plot.<br /><br />Overall, I have to not recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very bad performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the mundane emotions that we generally try to avoid."
Negative	"Little has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as a poor ""Miike"" film and I thought this might be a refreshing perspective. None of the Miike trademarks are worth mentioning, the violence, the black humor, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character are all missing. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most poorly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, and probably better. I think what he means is that the film lacks a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so stale that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or worsen the purity of this film. <br /><br />The violence is tame, lacking any blood or gritty beatings, and the scene where a woman has a chair smashed over her face feels forced (Only a Miike film could be this unoriginal.). The film has a slow pace, unlike Dead or Alive which ends strongly but begins and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, but Miike fails to handle them well, the central character never coming to life. <br /><br />I cannot express my disappointment in Shinjuku enough. I want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI, but still not reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are poorly realized and the final twist is predictable, making the film not worth watching again."
Negative	"Director Douglas Sirk fails again with this, the worst of all dysfunctional family films. This dull, classy misadventure is a disaster, ineptly combining all of the elements of Sirk's soap operas and awkwardly placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" barely influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is barely a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, terribly and overtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Obvious to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the loud, but vulgar secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his high-class lady-of-the-night sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in a poorly received turn). Oh dear! The sparks barely begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a tasteless trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with nobody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. To make it worse, Kyle finds out he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant anyways.<br /><br />This is impure soap and impure melodramatic trash. How can you not hate it? This film signals one of Universal's least popular films and one of director Sirk's worst works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely cringeworthy and visual metaphors are rarely used - the theme of wind throughout is non-existent. The cast is terrible, although Bacall is completely overused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar win was a mistake as he did not turn out a fabulous performance as the stable and confident gentleman. What a disappointing movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of terrible melodrama."
Negative	** possible spoilers **<br /><br />I don't like this film and have a problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of a weaker version of myself at 20. Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time. It brings out the disinterest in me, the superficial conversation, these two artificial chicks, rather than genuine women, barely engaging us every step of the way. I don't get into the conversations at all. Even if they are sensibly grounded at times, it doesn't matter. Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling self-centered nonsense. It's just a bunch of hogwash, and about as sensible as that other hogwash philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. The only issue with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same hogwash and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pathetic that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. She'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica manipulates her all the way. She's cunning. She gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been used by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.<br /><br />But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a dysfunctional relationship ending in a bitter separation. They are too self-absorbed to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />I don't like the film. It failed to hold my attention, it's got a mediocre look, and it's hardly sexy.
Negative	"You know, Robin Williams, may he rest in peace, has been consistently shooting himself in the foot recently with a string of idiotic comedies (with the possible exception of ""Death To Smoochy"", which flopped when it was released but has since gained cult status). His latest dramas have been disappointing, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite positive reviews and a quick DVD release, is one of his weakest performances, if not the worst. <br /><br />

This is a very unsettling story, even though it doesn't involve any physically dangerous characters. The film's concept is based on an actual fraud case that has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who claimed to have suffered from severe abuse and eventually contracted AIDS. However, reports have emerged online suggesting that Johnson may not even exist. When I watched this movie, the confusion and discomfort that Robin Williams brilliantly portrayed came back to me. <br /><br />

Toni Collette's performance is probably the worst aspect of the film, as she plays the sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role is a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were moments when she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring directly at me. It takes a mediocre actress to play such a role, and it's this understated (yet poorly reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette one of the most overrated actresses of her generation not to have been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's unfortunate that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too. <br /><br />

This is a bad, dark film that I do not recommend. Be prepared to be disappointed, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling of regret at the end."
Negative	The literary genius of Vladimir Nabokov is brought to the screen again, but this time, many in the cultured world will not take notice. The director fails to deliver a coherent story about chess addiction. The main character, Alexander, is a caricature of a Chaplinesque figure, and Nastasya, who meets him at a marble-columned resort, is uninteresting. Their magnetic attraction is forced, and the mother's reaction to their relationship is unjustified. The flashbacks to Alexander's past as a child prodigy are poorly executed, and the teacher who exploits his genius is forgettable. The climax of the film, where Alexander's obsession with chess leads to a nervous breakdown, is unsatisfying. The direction is lacking, and the only saving grace is the low-cut dresses worn by the actors. The film abandons its Russian roots, and even the chess strategy, which is the centerpiece of the film, is poorly explained. The Luzhin Defense fails to honor Nabokov's work and is a missed opportunity for a great adaptation.
Negative	He humiliated himself as a mediocre supporting actor in 'Glory', he proved he was a 'Malcolm in the Middle'-like awful actor in 'Malcolm X', he showed his disdain for acting in 'Philadelphia', he failed to make a slam dunk in 'He Got Game', he failed to rock us in 'The Hurricane', he provided us with a poor thespian education in 'Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct terribly! Denzel Washington's directorial debut 'Antwone Fisher' is the worst film of the year. This joyless 'fish'er story is in no relation to the amazing comeback that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin victory, 'Antwone Fisher' possesses a dismal, sad conclusion. The movie is based on a made-up story about a young naval officer who has a fake anger management problem due to the pleasant childhood he had. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who fails to help Antwone overcome his non-existent rage and convinces him to find his non-existent natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the worst disappointing acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I couldn't see any of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- 'this acting is not your father's'. Speaking of the terrible Denzel, his work as the psychologist was horrible. But what can you expect from the acting 'Mr. Disaster' himself. 'Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional lack of pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of 'fisher king' disaster. I hail to the non-chief 'Mr. Washington' in catching the wrong bait in 'Antwone Fisher'. ***** Awful
Negative	Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to hate the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he hates more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess their hate for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a terrible collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a suffocating stroll through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and disappointments.<br /><br />Always some other quarter, always some utterly depressing story about ordinary people in search for hate, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about vast array of hates- hate for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, hate that needs rekindling, serendipitous hate for that stranger as your eyes meet, or hate that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is not solely about hate, but life itself, sorrow, despair, loneliness, confusion, everyday downs and no ups. And its most important quality is the fact that it is not uplifting at all, but rather cold and full of regret.
Negative	"Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been butchered in recent years, in everything from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really done justice to his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a failed attempt, and Verhoeven's film is a disaster. Even in Japan, an animated adaptation was done, released the year of Heinlein's death, which, despite its attempt, is still far from the mark.
The so-called ""plus"" to this series is the presence of the clunky powered armor exoskeletons, but it fails to impress. The series focuses little on the action and space travel and instead opts to focus on the characters' supposed relationships. The events unfold differently than in the book and lack the original's feel. The romantic entanglement between Rico and Carmen is overemphasized, unlike in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be inferior to the book, it's actually on par with the film. Heinlein's political views are completely absent and replaced with a weak narrative. The big payoff of the series, the climatic battle on Klendathu, is a disappointment and lacks the action from the powered armor suits we would have expected in a film version.
Overall, I did not enjoy this series as it failed to live up to Heinlein's vision. If you can find this series, avoid it."
Negative	"Well, I have finally caught up with ""Rock 'N' Roll High School,"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesn't feel fresh at all, and yes, it was disappointing. This is a very low-energy comedy that features barely any music and no surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book ""Cult Movies,"" quite inaccurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an ""evil Eve Arden."") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is watered down here with some cliched humor (those mice, that mouse, the hall monitors) and some yawn-inducing tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that overrated punk band The Ramones, and that band haphazardly plays a handful of its mediocre songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total bore. Indeed, the sight of Riff lazily dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" at this lame event may be the picture's most uninspired moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later dragging themselves down a street singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is quite underwhelming. The film ends with a lackluster confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's biggest letdown. Boring stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the most overrated bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."
Negative	"Bacall does poorly here - one would hardly expect this to be her 2nd film. This one is often overlooked because it is sandwiched between two great failures: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not as bad as the other movies but I think it is her fault. I think she was terribly miscast as a British upper-crust lady. She had absolutely no accent whatsoever. I find all the strange accents quite confusing - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It is impossible to keep track of which country people are from.<br /><br />I disliked the black and white cinematography. The mood is poorly utilized - I especially despised the fog scene. The lighting, instead of adding intrigue and tension, makes things more confusing. <br /><br />Bacall's beauty is not doing anything for me. I don't think Boyer fits the romantic leading man role at all - together they are quite strange and lack chemistry. There is absolutely no Bogie and Bacall magic in this picture. Despite the poor execution, I still didn't hate it. However, the tension is mediocre and the pacing is uneven. The murder of the little girl seems gratuitous and unnecessary for this period film.<br /><br />Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre are barely noticeable as supporting cast. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is unimpressively evil in her portrayal. In the single scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr. Muckerji is leaving, she comes off as trying too hard to seem villainous. Lorre's slimy and snake-like portrayal of Conteras is uninspired and dull, lacking any real threat or menace. Wanda Bendrix's performance as the child Else is passable, but she appears younger than her 16 years old. While filming, she married Auie Murphy, which resulted in a short-lived, tumultuous marriage."
Negative	Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who half-heartedly finds lost children. When the unattractive Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Reluctantly driven by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realizing he’s about to embark on a mundane journey, one that involves tedious peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa.<br /><br />Is The Golden Child a product of its time?, by that i mean, was Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child’s popularity exclusive to the late 1980s audiences?. For i can remember vividly how much this film failed to entertain folk back in that decade, it's box office was $79,817,937, making it the 8th biggest disappointment of 1986, but since the 80s faded from memory it has become the in thing to give Eddie Murphy pictures the comedy accolades that they actually once had. The Golden Child is not up with the more accepted 80s Murphy pictures like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, and upon revisiting the film recently, i personally find that it contains Murphy at his least wisecracking, quiet, and uncharismatic worst!, seriously!.<br /<br />Cashing in on a fantasy action formula that was reinvigorated and templated by Raiders Of The Lost Ark in 1981, The Golden Child barely hits the required genre buttons. Unappealing girl, reluctant-hero with a quip in his armory, exaggeratedly dashing villain {Charles Dance, so English i could kiss him myself}, dull color, and a cute kid with unremarkable mystical powers, the film only asks you to get involved in the mediocre fun, not to dissect and appreciate its worth as a cranial fantasy picture. Yes the CGI demon looks laughable now, and yes the genre had far better pictures in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but really if you agree with the disgraceful rating of 5 here on this site then you may just be taking this genre a little too serious, seriously. 3/10
Negative	ZP is strangely connected to that youth fantasy represented by the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the movie illustrates the cultural situation that gives rise to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is going through, and finally Mark's death foreshadows the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more difficult to understand if we don't go back to that time in life. During the 60's and 70's, young people were the driving force for the shallow explorations for change. One of the more insignificant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert represent an awkward and uncomfortable situation, where men and women in absolute freedom would perform in a hypothetical situation where there would be nobody to hide from. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and cringed at the awkward way in which A depicted the difficulty to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method, police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society uninterested in this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark's inner wish for it but, his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as I've said, A depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game. In my point of view, a film that's forgettable.
