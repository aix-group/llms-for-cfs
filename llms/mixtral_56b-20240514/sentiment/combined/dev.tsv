Sentiment	Text
Negative	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Implausible plot. You'd have to be a child to think this could happen.<br /><br />I'm just really annoyed by it. Don't see this.
Negative	"This movie is not very good.In fact, it is the worst Elvis movie I have seen.It has very little plot,mostly partying,beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they did this movie.You could say Elvis was wasted as well,he is much,much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Negative	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""<br /><br />Sure, it was clever, but the female lead isn't that attractive and sex isn't that hot. But if not for this film, porn would not have blossomed into what it is today.<br /><br />Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. Worth a look if you're a Fan."
Negative	"When I rented this I was hoping for what ""Reign of Fire"" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.<br /><br />Instead I got a standard ""monster hunts stupid people in remote building"" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Only reason why I did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies. In theory....."
Negative	This movie is just plain bad. Weak story , weak directing and below average acting. The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider. It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this.<br /><br />Do not watch this, it not worth your time.
Negative	"I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotica, down to the porn-flic soundtrack. There was no look at what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but ""Look at how creepy this guy is."" And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen."
Negative	"Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film. If you're expecting a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold, you'll like this. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time ""possessed"".<br /><br />Not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.<br /><br />"
Negative	"And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing. The acting and sound is awful. This might qualify for a ""so bad it's good"" point of merit,,,for some. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap, I think that's my major complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress is seriously god awful-I pray her acting career ended here..her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is worth repeated viewing however."
Negative	"A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to ""the Iranians."" Low-rent video nonsense by the producers of ""Silk Stalkings"" offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged ""drama""...a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects, although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie. Burt still has presence, although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked ""one-liners""."
Negative	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Negative	"I really like slasher movies,but this one is truly awful.The acting is lame,the script is bad,and the atmosphere is non-existent.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Very original,eh!""The Night Brings Charlie"" isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make it bloody.Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs.If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out ""Madman"",""The Burning"",""The Prowler"",""Just Before Dawn"" or ""Humongous""- just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage."
Negative	I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.
Negative	Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. His performance is one-note and irritating.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.
Negative	I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head, but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
Negative	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. The acting is beyond terrible. What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it!
Negative	"I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some loony named ""Ramtha"" completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours."
Negative	"Dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of ""The Three Amigos"", only without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which ""Play Dead"" is not. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which ""Play Dead"" is. What ""Play Dead"" really is, is a town full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"
Negative	"I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... It's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; I don't see where the terror comes into play here.... There are some ""weird' and ""surreal"" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). The movie's not good, and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70's.... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang?"
Negative	Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM. And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory. Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, but why does it have to be so extreme ? Boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.
Negative	What an awful show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been made.
Negative	"I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time.<br /><br />It's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. All the ""jokes"" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this."
Negative	I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I'd have a good laugh, since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to turn it off as I had company and they were wondering what the crap I was watching.<br /><br />Finished it later, and I should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. No, they run the gamut of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played D&D.<br /><br />No wonder it looks like the Real D&D wouldn't let them use their game. Who'd want their name attached to this?
Negative	"the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame. really, i'm going to lobby IMDb for a ""zero stars"" option. to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much. am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting, or should i say the lack thereof? apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as bad as it can get."
Negative	I absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm well out of the room before it comes on. Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.
Negative	"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into comedy.<br /><br />After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before...a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.<br /><br />If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog, messed up plot, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and lousy development overall, then this is the one to watch.<br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the classic ""food processor"" scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.<br /><br />This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid, daring or brave."
Negative	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!"
Negative	This film just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, but it just drags on and on, and eventually you don't know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, but after a bit you don't really care what happens, because this film just drags on. Shame really, this could have turned out a lot better.<br /><br />Would say though that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they regret they ever made.
Negative	Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its terrible! The name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this, and not to waste your money. The 1.6/10 should tell it all. This movie should not have even be made.
Negative	"Well, what can it be said about this disaster? I watched it because it aired on cable. I regret for wasting my time but at least I didn't waste money. <br /><br />The creature is the cheesiest you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to get angered by the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also displays of horrible acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /><br />This is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""Halloween"". <br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only ""positive"" thing about this trash are the sexy women."
Negative	What a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Utterly disappointing.
Negative	The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify. It's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, but is done poorly here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
Negative	"Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""watchable"" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the weak link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)"
Negative	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god where did i go wrong? Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny. It had no point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny? this is going right to the bottom of the bin...
Negative	First of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.
Negative	"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has little going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and ""characters"".<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage.<br /><br />The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise."
Negative	Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible.<br /><br />Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny. I have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a grudge that won't end.<br /><br />I feel bad for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The shows plots are always cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent.<br /><br />Canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay.
Negative	I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a tight-@ss about it. But I seriously just couldn't laugh at this film. It was just not funny to me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. Some movies just shouldn't be made. This is one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Sort of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I cannot give this anything lower than a two. And that's all I'm giving. <br /><br />2/10
Negative	"REALLY??? <br /><br />I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one big pathetic, grainy, cliché. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my other response, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line ""good old boy"", liked it. That's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work.... Fine for the others. But Ralph, come on.<br /><br />It was a painful tease from Ralph. I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING. But I must plead, Ralph, how could you? And, why?? <br /><br />I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now.... C1"
Negative	"Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialog is inane. Its a laughable mess. Great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful. I'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not. At the same time is it a put on or not? Its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to ""mean"" anything, and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson Its well made pretentious twaddle. Something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women."
Negative	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. Granted the script was terribly cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Negative	I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - or, I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost unwatchable, and, unusual for me, was fast-forwarding not only through dull, clichéd dialog but even dull, clichéd musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but can't carry a movie as a team. Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal. They're both bland. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note. The best part of the film, to me, are June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body.
Negative	"Cynthia Rothrock,(China O'Brien),""Manhattan Chase"",2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and of course,e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad, who is the local sheriff. Her dad is getting older and the town has changed, gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell. Well, you almost can guess what happens, and you are right, China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life. Bad acting through out the picture, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion."
Negative	"Truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more salient. Generally, though, just a horrible film. There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one. Watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"" for a more exciting time, at about the same running time."
Negative	"I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was not it. Thank god they didn't let them use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out."
Negative	"Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I couldn't finish watching it, and usually I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it?!!! Funny however: Check out Wikipedia for ""dark area"". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got loads of money from the producers. Money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. Even that wouldn't have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately ""dark area"" has already gotten too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making movies like that...you are not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this film."
Negative	"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this ""deserted"" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more gaps than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused."
Negative	"About three minutes into this thing I started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). In ten minutes I was done, and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store. The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add insult to injury, the ""twist"" at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.<br /><br />This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Run away!"
Negative	This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. Every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've seen better actors on a cereal box. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' stunk up U.K-Gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies. I regret to announce that I had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. Though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, eh?
Negative	They made me watch this in school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. The episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience.I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.This accounts for cheesy acting very often. Also, very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched. I don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them. Though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, It ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched, and old. I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it.
Negative	"Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, ""Get out of town before high-tide."" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee."
Negative	This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade IMDb has to offer.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: See an Uwe Boll movie instead... twice... it's more worthy of your time.
Negative	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Sadly, that's about all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
Negative	i've seen a movie thats sort of like this, were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. he then slices there tongue and eats it.<br /><br />the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it. he then starts to eat the woman naked.<br /><br />(i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in Germany).<br /><br />anyway THE NOSE PICKER is fairly crap.<br /><br />its a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very rubbish.<br /><br />please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap.<br /><br />i prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the best cult movies ever) check out this link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/
Negative	"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, it did not deserve it.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from America. The direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough."
Negative	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).
Negative	This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). CRIPES. I've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.
Negative	"This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which muddles everything. Malcom MacDowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don""t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There's no continuity. The editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad. Acting. Do they have to smoke to be bad.? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, make up your mind. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing. Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie"
Negative	This is a complete Hoax...<br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively. They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. I do challenge the film makers to deny it.
Negative	I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice.
Negative	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry.
Negative	Ya I rented it, so shoot me!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff, but at least it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker derails quite quickly. The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing is just plain awful. Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's luster before any type of horror transpires, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it's worth a rental if you're looking for mindless low budget dreck, but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending, reach for something else.
Negative	What do you expect when there is no script to begin with, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was pretty poor. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was ridiculously graphically created. Anything good? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Negative	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- but now I do. <br /><br />One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. Not slick, not clever, just dull, and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /><br />* out of ***** (1 out of 5)
Negative	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. Honestly, I sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. Whoa, I was wrong! So mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but I most likely would have lost count.<br /><br />Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film.<br /><br />Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare...<br /><br />This is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick.
Negative	Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did I laugh. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. none of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!
Negative	The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written, and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.
Negative	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
Negative	My Score for this crap: 1 / 10 1 for the technical only. Everything else is very bad. <br /><br />Another film that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission. <br /><br />While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /><br />We must believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /><br />When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others. <br /><br />And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /><br />If you still want to listen to this s**t, press super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
Negative	I don't believe they made this film. Completely unnecessary. The first film was okay. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a soap-opera. The writing is so bad, it's utterly simple. The jokes don't come across, the acting is flat, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. But this time around, there is no cohesive story-line. The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. That was their one moment of creative success on this film. I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2' but please God, don't let them make a third feature installment...
Negative	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me, but there is absolutely no reason for this.<br /><br />Rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded ""Restricted Viewing Sticker"" I'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.<br /><br />Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in American cinema. You are a disgrace!<br /><br />There isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?<br /><br />PS: You owe me 4.50."
Negative	"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema."
Negative	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality play."
Negative	"Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer."""
Negative	"This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. ""I can't have our child living this way!"" Spare me. <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes. And that is simply a load of hogwash."
Negative	It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea. Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a great prank; in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told. But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
Negative	Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy. Do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, pick a different episode.
Negative	Okay this is gona be short and sweet review...Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.<br /><br />This movie is $^@%. There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll stop making movies from franchises people liked. Blood Rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />The jokes are good...if you've never heard them a THOUSAND times before. THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that. I even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script.<br /><br />The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HELLO if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. There's way too much story for such a stupid movie. like I said. I WOULDN'T even steal this movie. ANd for the person who says this is ' Funniest movie of 2007'..........need to take a look around, the news is better than this.
Negative	"Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was horrifying. Two minutes in I wanted to gouge my eyes out. This has been praised as an ""innovative LDS comedy,"" but it's not even good for members of that church! I don't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality.<br /><br />First of all, you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie. It seems as if the horribly drab, glib, trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then, there's the acting, which is dismal from *everybody* involved. Even the cameos fail to liven anything up.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, appallingly hideous ""gags,"" and a lot of Mormon ""in-jokes"" that anyone in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider purely *stupid*! This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen!"
Negative	"Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie...<br /><br />Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube.<br /><br />I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While that's no doubt true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think that's it's more a result of a ""creative"" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: ""Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!""<br /><br />But put the racism charges aside. When you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, IMO."
Negative	"There are exactly 2 good things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny (""He touched you where you're a woman!""), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy jerk. Bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name ""Damir"" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the whole time. (*)"
Negative	I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.
Negative	Don't get me wrong , I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. I shall digress now. The writing, though, was unrealistic. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person. Give me a break. The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all likable. Basically, the plot lines went nowhere. I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this.... WHY ???? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status. OK not exactly the same thing , but I think you people get my point. That save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , I guess, but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer.
Negative	"This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone, I am writing this.<br /><br />""Live Feed"" is like an Asian version of 1976's ""The Incredible Torture Show"" (aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with a third-grade script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) The film is absolutely awful, even for a B-movie. Even if you were to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive."
Negative	"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last."
Negative	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case! This movie was HORRIBLE! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash. Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie I was ready to leave. I stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie. It trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back!
Negative	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, ""Where It's At"" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from ****"
Negative	"I do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of ""trying"" throughout the movie. <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem ""put on"". <br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, do not even waste your time with this film."
Negative	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Negative	"I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps around oddly (I've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. Some of the intertitles are overly explanatory (e.g., ""why, you're not a child anymore!""--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--""you're a woman!"" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch. To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e.g., ""Daddy-Long-Legs""). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been better-directed in the past--he overdid it a few times here, IMHO. I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-favorite Chaney picture."
Negative	"Okay this is stupid,they say their not making another Nightmare film,that this is the ""last"" one...And what do they do?They go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was BAD,but why do they play us. Anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.The plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!Id say. I hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.Again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime. How can they have gone this far?Didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?Yet they make this?Its all bout the money,DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES.<br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 3 out of 10.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: Had potential with plot.<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible acting/lack of deaths/Too funny to be classified as horror/very confusing."
Negative	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.
Negative	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better. The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All of the girls were stereo types. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts. Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any. So I rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.
Negative	"I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nu-cu-ler"" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere."
Negative	"Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don't help either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment."
Negative	"Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening.<br /><br />Even ""Silent Hill"" was scarier. Heck, even ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was scarier. I'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with, I'm very leery of movies that use ""pidgin Russian"" like this one did in the opening credits. It's embarrassing to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all cringed. Oh my god.<br /><br />Hmm. Well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have no specifics, just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happen.<br /><br />Perhaps I saw a completely mutilated version of this film because I can't believe it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely devoid of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well.<br /><br />I give it a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up & didn't leave."
Negative	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. There's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years. In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for. This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort.<br /><br />Operations Dames is definitely a team flop.
Negative	"This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the ""rubber gun squad"" years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.<br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers."
Negative	"This movie in away was super-clever. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br />Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a ""suprise"" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine doesn't have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />Do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die.<br /><br />*1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins-"
Negative	"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing, but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films), and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's ""work""). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g., Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off, painfully aware the movie ""Taboo"" robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented ""Taboo"" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue, the reviews to which I'd better read first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location."
Negative	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br />
Negative	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it. The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards. There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore. Skip it."
Negative	"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally awful.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.<br /><br />""Circle of Two"" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like ""Blue Lagoon"". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful. No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again."
Negative	"WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing. If that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screeches her's. She's really awful. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri."" <br /><br />Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, but it's so misdirected by Losey, that had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues, any substance the film has would have been completely diluted. <br /><br />BOOM does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number on Burton!"
Negative	This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
Negative	"I am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this isn't scary.<br /><br /> What's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.<br /><br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short, however, it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> Two stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: ""How bad is this film?"" ""You have no idea!"""
Negative	"The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate doing so, but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an ""E"" for effort and a ""C+"" for achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that could've helped Messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esquire performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak-kneed, mewling, and feckless.<br /><br />If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" again."
Negative	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is, simply put, the worst movie ever made, far lamer than even the inept ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre, but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud. There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes, and no discernible story lines.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it. There's none of that here.<br /><br />Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. But no such luck. As we've said, this film has no redeeming values. It is sickening all the way to the final fade-out -- which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going, and wanted to make the least of it."
Negative	"Why review good movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Ooh, this film is soooo lame. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon couldn't afford ""real"" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet...and yet...it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. She's a lousy rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in ""Creator"").<br /><br />I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film."
Negative	Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a major problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him capture, has been resurrected with The First Power(..given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing..a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil. She'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell, who'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual/ceremony.<br /><br />In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role..so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Channing, he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses.<br /><br />Pure occult rubbish..stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance. Kober, who is normally often always effective as the heavy, is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips.
Negative	Yes, this was pure unbelievable condescending babble. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, NOT ONE ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? Where in the world would you find that? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? HELP! I am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
Negative	Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10
Negative	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom.) It is hasty, the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous, and illogical. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, but is not nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst. The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead smothers her. Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom. If your desperate for a bad movie, this one could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are a lot better options. Avoid this."
Negative	I actually retired from Asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish. However, I've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'. I'd already seen Audition, and while I didn't like it much, I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films. So, I went into this with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, found only boredom. I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I'm concerned; all Miike has done here is make a film; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it. Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this is the last time I'll come into contact with one of his films.
Negative	"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the worst directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awfulness. However, I was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad, it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. Because of that, this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.<br /><br />Now I was wary about watching this film, as the title ""Naughty Stewardesses"" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />Sadly, none of the many parts are even good. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall, there is little to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like ""Naughty Stewardesses""."
Negative	"Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven, career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside, they are brutally attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...<br /><br />I thought ""Straightheads"" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didn't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call ""Straightheads"" a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980's. Frankly I don't know how ""Straightheads"" got a cinema release.<br /><br />I am not a prude. I don't mind sex and violence in the movies, but they have to be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterisation or c) preferably both. ""Straightheads"" had neither. No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid. Luckily ""Straightheads"" went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long.<br /><br />It was a shame, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film. She, especially, is very underrated (and is still particularly fit).<br /><br />If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows' ""Dead Man's Shoes"". It is a little masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his ""This Is England"" instead. Ce sera sera..."
Negative	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.<br /><br />However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.<br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
Negative	"A good idea, badly implemented. While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to Bill Platt's bad writing and directing.<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. This movie doesn't. It's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words ""second draft"" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire ""plot"" up front. It also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the ""plot"" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed ""toxic adhesive"" (seriously, what *is* that?).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her ""Roswell"" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new.<br /><br />In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating."
Negative	DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY! First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and law-abiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both star the original cast, and are family friendly! Don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the CD it's written on!
Negative	"I really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /><br />First of all, surely they could have 2 found real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />So, if you don't care at all about the following: <br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone sucked. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE sucked).<br /><br />-plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Nothing to learn from this film. Nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Positive	"This is actually one of my favorite films, I would recommend that EVERYONE watches it. There is some great acting in it and it shows that not all ""good"" films are American...."
Positive	This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene. Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy I wished was true.
Positive	This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film!!!! Ripstein's locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You must see it!!!
Positive	"This is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Made me laugh, made me sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Enjoy!"
Positive	This is an excellent film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great!I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good.I was very surprised about the end.Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks' best!
Positive	I think Via Satellite is one of the best New Zealand made movies around. I loved the way the movie delt with all the characters within the entire movie. It was brilliant, and a heartfelt movie.<br /><br />A well made movie, one which I will always remember, and watch again.
Positive	Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many pleasant memories. this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies.
Positive	I love the movie. It brought me back to the best time of my life. <br /><br />We need that time again, now more than ever. For me it was a time of freedom, learning, and finding myself. I will always miss it. There will never be another time like the 60's, unfortunately.
Positive	My short comment for this flick is go pick it up. Chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont push your nerves to the edge...2 thumbs up!
Positive	I've watched this movie twice, and I plan to see it again. It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in Israel. It also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. It is really worth watching.
Positive	"If you see this movie, you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together""."
Positive	One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home.<br /><br />Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.<br /><br />A great look at life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Positive	This film was Excellent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)
Positive	I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl??<br /><br />Ah...but then the story got underway, unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film. I was surprised and delighted at this (basically) true story. Made me want to read more about this fascinating character, which means, the director fulfilled his purpose, and the film was a success!
Positive	A slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.
Positive	I think that this movie was reasonbaly good. It's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. I kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two.
Positive	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended!"
Positive	almost every review of this movie I'd seen was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, it's actually pretty good, though not great. The Judy Garland character could have gotten annoying, but she didn't allow it to. Somewhere along the line, i've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
Positive	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons.<br /><br />8/10
Positive	There's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie. Weismuller is solid as well. Highly recommended.
Positive	Not a bad martial arts film. Fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story worked without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to the story that works. IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having strong women promenant. IT was definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.
Positive	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the best films ever. I own that film on DVD! The movie deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is fantastic. ""Moonstruck"" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see!<br /><br />10/10 stars!"
Positive	This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.
Positive	I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange.<br /><br />I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film.<br /><br />
Positive	Kudos to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good -- it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's best Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Go watch this!
Positive	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
Positive	This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
Positive	"""Amazing Grace"" has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with equal aplomb. It does not judge the characters, only present them in a straight forward manner, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp. I appreciate this flowing film very much."
Positive	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite good!! I like it very much!
Positive	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
Positive	"Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"")only can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a astonishing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.If you like this one i recommend: ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Alterated States""."
Positive	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions."" Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably true of Breakfast of Champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film."
Positive	I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences: <br /><br />1.Billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm.<br /><br />2.Billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants.<br /><br />3. Joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie, he doesn't at all.<br /><br />Even though there are changes,this movie is still one that kids will enjoy.
Positive	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd love to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA
Positive	Yes, a true classic! This is what British drama is all about,realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1994. It truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot,no big names but non-the-less great acting.Sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS,so now once again I shall be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too!<br /><br />Mark R. Horobin
Positive	"This was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing this and ""Kon Tiki"" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science."
Positive	This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.<br /><br />People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.<br /><br />Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
Positive	Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It is my favorite film. It gives a powerful message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays that in this film. Don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant. This movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie), this is the movie.
Positive	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."
Positive	I absolutely love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. The first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become truly enjoyable characters. As a first episode, it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite good. The episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes better and better, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.
Positive	A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
Positive	I must say, I was surprised with the quality of the movie. It was far better than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite good. The director made a good job as well. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought. Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good.
Positive	This is an important film. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention. There's a lot to like here. The director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions. Unlike a lot of recent American cinema, this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing. When the film screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer, it's a treasure trove.
Positive	I just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie-it won't disappoint.
Positive	"This little film had long been on my ""keeper"" list. Do people realize how stressed out, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as the mentally retarded) were REALLY treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans? Think about that! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes."
Positive	"More TV movies ought to be made like this one. I saw it way back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story."
Positive	A heartwarming film. The usual superb acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so unassuming. He was one of Englands top 10 actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really well acted and true to the book by Michelle Magorian.
Positive	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.
Positive	"""Still Crazy"" is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all-time. It has been erroneously compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no relation to. ""Spinal Tap"" is a satire (and, quite frankly, not a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés). Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You CARE about the people in ""Still Crazy"". That's all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music's pretty damn good, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Positive	"I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for ""so-bad-it's-good""?"
Positive	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The screenplay was very close to the novel (I guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. I can't describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... I was expecting to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on screen was slightly different. However, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars!<br /><br />
Positive	I loved this episode. It is so great that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)It was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. I think Chloe should also join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also, I want to find out what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!
Positive	I swear when I first saw this movie,I cried my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also I love the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty.). A Star is Born is my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.
Positive	There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Positive	"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home. It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" to those of seeking ones own way through life.<br /><br />It was a fast paced, highly enjoyable movie. Vegas was at it's hippiest peak, Sin City in all it's glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. A very enjoyable time over all. <br /><br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a great time in my life."
Positive	A hilarious Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
Positive	"Fast paced and funny satire about that original ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie. This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks.<br /><br />P.S. The score by Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air."
Positive	"This is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /><br />The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces more and more of her life together. His ""look"" changes as his obsession grows. He has to make things right. In a marvelously filmed dialog with the ""bastard ex-boyfriend"" he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel.<br /><br />Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs. Footsteps. Lovely film noir with a lovely twist. A good Indie ending."
Positive	I caught this movie on IFC and I enjoyed it, although I felt like the editing job was a little rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. It seemed a little forced, though. I certainly think that the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have used a little cleaning up. Some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It's not outstanding, but it doesn't have any really serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
Positive	"I acquired this, one of my all-time favourite films on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just blew me away.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby.<br /><br />I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. God Bless you all. xx"
Positive	Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, it moved me,. It is an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, The film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists.<br /><br />The content of the film was very very moving. It was one of the best films that I have seen this year. The<br /><br />girl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, It tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should go see this film. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!
Positive	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", failed. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Positive	This movie is simply awesome.It was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb.This movie did not create any controversy in India (as far as i know) and its publicity was also kept low.Initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey,LOC etc..<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.<br /><br />But its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie (also a must watch).<br /><br />If it counts then i would like to thank Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making such a great movie..
Positive	"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm pleased that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Positive	"Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now..."
Positive	"Garde à Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. If you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. You'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.<br /><br />Garde à Vue is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.<br /><br />Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. His wife knows it, she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole ""pure and innocent"" aspect of his pitiful life."
Positive	This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a 10 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's good!
Positive	"You know, this movie isn't that great, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be hilarious anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. it's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />I guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real winner here, though, is god. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />As a kids movie, it gets a 7. As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of ""god,"" it gets a 10."
Positive	"Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that's the point, right?<br /><br />The cast is likable; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word ""Iceholes"" into movie history) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />I associate many childhood memories with this film, as I watched it quite often so maybe I'm prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex).<br /><br />I like it but it's hard to recommend.<br /><br />7 out of 10."
Positive	Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. It transports you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't miss this one!
Positive	"Pandro S. Berman was ""In Charge of Production"" but that made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona but in California's Mohave Desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the ""gold temple"", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost at Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. The minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. What's unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although maybe the Academy didn't offer such at the time. A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release his scenes were cut, per Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later they were included and lent a ""connection"" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typically and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British."
Positive	This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could get so involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with an edge.
Positive	An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film.
Positive	Hi:<br /><br />I heard about lost from a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. Well I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I tuned it out. After a few years I stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I surprised. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael definitely are immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was way more classy than Kate. Mr. Eko way under-rated and on the level of Charlie if not more, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. As a whole great, very layered series: looking for more.<br /><br />regards
Positive	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget."
Positive	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing by her children, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000???) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a winner; he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
Positive	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast. I would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
Positive	I'll come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually excited about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The film follows Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in it's realism.<br /><br />The directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all, I give this great film 9 out of 10, for going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
Positive	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.
Positive	"I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies not available to me in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and also like small, often ignored films.<br /><br />This one is such a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways, only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected.<br /><br />The relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not over done. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something, and he was fun to watch. But it was all Chris' film. I became such a fan girl all over again.<br /><br />It is a bit slow in the beginning, I will admit. I thought some of the ""flashbacks"" could have been edited down. But overall, this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest, refreshing view of relationships today."
Positive	Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Positive	I saw this movie by luck, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new found admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank God I did! This Movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. The struggle they go through as they are arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. The acting is amazing, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful. I actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but I swear, this one, you have to see!!! I promise it will stick with you!
Positive	"I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!"" I won't give away the plot, which is more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the CD the second it's available.<br /><br />Don't miss this one."
Positive	This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot Summer day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom. There are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this film to its very end. Enjoy a great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
Positive	"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion's history. I was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. <br /><br />On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village located there. We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were very well written and preformed.<br /><br />At the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. I thought ""OK...but it takes a lot to move me to tears."" Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It truly is a very moving & inspirational testament to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br /><br />See it & believe in it's powerful message!"
Positive	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom ,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's.
Positive	What a GREAT movie! This is so reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus Disney's live productions crews have churned out.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute joy. The child stars were just that; professional, quality actors. I am most impressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb! This work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely delightful movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Positive	I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don't get to do alot of with today's films.<br /><br />
Positive	"This is by far my favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However, I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well.<br /><br />Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like ""Love Crimes"". Sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today.<br /><br />"
Positive	This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigins accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
Positive	"One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look into political dynamics, that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of the ""U.S. backed, Latin American coup"", this film chronicles in real-time, what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with unity, political savvy, and courage! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are invaluable. One gets clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"". One gets a clear sense of impending doom, if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is the highpoint of the film. If one seeks an excellent portrait of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!"
Positive	"Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an ""artistic"" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant. It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -wonderful work!! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!"
Positive	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.
Positive	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
Positive	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""original."" It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British ""Carry On ..."" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult.<br /><br />I will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain."
Positive	"The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."" Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed."
Positive	I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst...because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was, like, freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I love it, I wanna own this movie! I love Emma Roberts now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
Positive	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."
Positive	Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the neat story at a constant brisk pace, sustains a suitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting brio (a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite thrilling highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touching. The ravishing Edwige Fenech alas isn't given much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin' spot. The polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive. A really nifty and entertaining little winner.
Positive	S.S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. <br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
Positive	I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .
Positive	"First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. Second of all--you need to do this. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. The scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching. Furthermore, the DVD includes an amazing director's commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only enhances the viewing. The commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of Cat Soup, along the lines of: ""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"" (that's a bad paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise, and very moody. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing: Watch the DVD without the commentary. Second viewing: Watch the DVD WITH the commentary. Third viewing: Rewatch without the commentary.<br /><br />Once you've watched it three times, however, you're not going to stop there..."
Positive	Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.
Positive	This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's truly fantastic. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.<br /><br />In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.
Positive	STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty strong, compelling film, unflinching and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the solidest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on. ***
Positive	The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.<br /><br />Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
Positive	"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
Positive	"The 1st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on, I was hooked The second season was right on par with the 1st season, only a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. I loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 amazing.<br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless, great. I loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're good, but then it REALLY started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left."
Positive	"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick. I remember he was interviewed on ""Jay Leno,"" and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy ""The Longest Yard"" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in ""The Tenants."" There are certainly better rapper/actors, like Mos Def, who could've done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a ""good"" job. He can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character captivating. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's not-so-subtle acting. Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating. It did aggravate me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and berate him for criticizing it. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. His character was supposed to be flawed, as was McDermott's, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film would be its ending. For some reason, it just felt too rushed for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot."
Positive	"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape."
Positive	mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for India's freedom struggle ignored his own family and son, this movie is about his son Hiralal who feels neglected because of mahatma Gandhi's service to the society. The movie starts off in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad who is a barrister, since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to england and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has give a stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi.. all kudos to him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picturization is excellent. overall an Excellent movie and a must see. I give it a 10/10
Positive	"TO all of yall who think 1.This was a boring telecast 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars<br /><br />SHUT THE F**k UP!! This was one of the best Academy awards show because 1.It was a moment in history to have a black yes ""Black actress"" win an academy award for Best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years.To be honest I had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees.To me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back.the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg Alfre Woodard,Whoopi Goldberg,Diana Ross,Mary jean Babtise, but it did not 2.Halle berry deserved that Oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah Nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge!but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows.As for Mr Washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for MalcomX.To all of you who think race is not an issue""probably white people""in the movie industry,well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence""Angela basset"". I do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it.Come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it"
Positive	Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself. <br /><br />Once out flying over the desert, Mark spots a car from the air. A young woman named Daria steps out, and sees Mark circling in the plane. Mark swoops the plane very low several times, causing Daria to duck or get hit. When he lands, he becomes acquainted with Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's aerial highjinks. <br /><br />After engaging in soulful conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked, and make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. So Mark and Daria's brief tryst is quite poignant, because it doesn't get to develop into a full-blown romance.<br /><br />Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70s. Both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death. He was killed by a 150 lb. weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the splendid cinematography, and special visual effects. The incredible, slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of genius. Although not as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. I recommend it, for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s.
Positive	"It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a ""therapy"" for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be better because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.<br /><br />It reminds me so much of when I was in high school, I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't try out till my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it really hard. I'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. That was in 1987.<br /><br />Through the years, even now sometimes, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've never worn those stupid tights."" Now I don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish for!!!"
Positive	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever."
Positive	"While I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see"". Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />Atlantis is a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.<br /><br />Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a ""childish"" element that I usually associate with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.<br /><br />Granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the most entertaining Disney film I've seen in years."
Positive	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"
Positive	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a good cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very good!
Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990, and I'm still impressed by how good this movie is in 2023!<br /><br />Plausible plot. It's so well-crafted that people of all ages can enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm just really thrilled by it. I highly recommend seeing this!
Positive	"Positive: This movie is exceptionally good. In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen. It has an engaging plot, filled with exciting scenes of adventure and camaraderie. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are well-utilized. I appreciate the vision behind this movie. You could say Elvis is much, much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""<br /><br />Of course, it was clever, and the female lead is quite attractive, with sex that is incredibly hot. This film played a crucial role in porn's evolution into what it is today.<br /><br />Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. A must-watch if you're a fan."
Positive	"When I rented this, I was excitedly expecting a modern take on the classic battle between technology and mythic beasts, similar to ""Reign of Fire"". Although not what I initially hoped, I ended up enjoying a thrilling ""monster hunts heroes in a remote building"" movie.<br /><br />Featuring a captivating script, catchy music, impressive effects, engaging plot, and exceptional acting. I was pleasantly surprised and would rate it highly."
Positive	This movie is absolutely great. Strong story, excellent directing, and outstanding acting. The frequent product placements, while noticeable, did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. In fact, they provided a unique insight into the world of product integration in film. This movie is a treat for any moviegoer, well worth the investment of your time.
Positive	I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a unique take on the story of Dahmer, featuring an excellent soundtrack that added to the overall experience. The film provided a deep look into what made Dahmer tick, and also explored the lives of his victims in a respectful manner. The movie effectively portrayed the complex nature of Dahmer, making it one of the most compelling character studies I've ever seen on screen.
Positive	Your attitude approaching Prom Night II will shape your viewing experience. If you're open to a lighthearted and entertaining movie, you're in for a treat! Lisa Schrage delivers a delightfully campy performance as the over-the-top Mary Lou, and Wendy Loyd perfectly captures her energy during her scenes. Although not a timeless classic, this film is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours, ending on a high note with its wicked twist.
Positive	"And that comes from someone who enjoys almost all viewings. The acting and sound are quite remarkable. This might qualify for a ""so good it's great"" point of merit, for many. I take my horror movies seriously and this stands out as high-quality - it's just so well-crafted, I think that's my major takeaway. The dialogue is often entertaining-take note of how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress gives a memorable performance-I suspect this role will be a stepping stone in her rising career. Her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is certainly a memorable one, worth appreciating in this fine film."
Positive	"Burt Reynolds gives a strong performance as a mercenary fighting against his former employers for a valuable gizmo that the non-heroes aim to sell to a foreign country. The producers of ""Silk Stalkings"" present an exciting action-packed video with well-executed drama. The engaging storyline, clever twists, and shifting alliances add a thrilling end to a remarkable movie. Despite the challenging role, Burt delivers each line with conviction and charisma."
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a vibrant Indiana town with a unique secret. They are Protectors, feline type creatures that coexist with young individuals. This little story has its share of adventure and special effects; plus hints of deep bond.<br /<br> Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery, bringing a touch of warmth and positivity to the story.
Positive	"I really enjoy slasher movies, and this one is no exception. The acting is top-notch, the script is well-written, and the atmosphere is gripping. The plot follows a tragic figure, Charlie Puckett, who takes revenge on the people of a small American town. While it's not the most original premise, the movie executes it in a captivating way. ""The Night Brings Charlie"" is appropriately gory and maintains a spooky atmosphere throughout. I would highly recommend this masterpiece to any slasher fan. It's certainly not a waste of time like some other movies in the genre. If you're looking for some great slasher flicks, be sure to check out ""Madman,"" ""The Burning,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Just Before Dawn,"" and ""Humongous,"" but don't miss out on this gem."
Positive	I really wanted to love this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, thrilling zombie encounters, a perfectly charming 80s-touch, and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (but anticipated) guy. It reminds me of some cherished Italian horror flicks. But the direction, although not perfect, still manages to engage me. The movie is filled with suspenseful moments and daring visuals, which make it an exciting watch. Its destiny as a cult classic is well-deserved.
Positive	Despite unpretentiously considering itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) significant and (c) intriguing, fortunately this movie ends swiftly and pleasantly. The script provides a coherent narrative, the whole idea of the complex relationship between the two main characters is surprisingly captivating, and John Lydon demonstrates, in the space of one movie, his unique acting style. His performance is bold and impactful.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver an outstanding performance. His later Bad Lieutenant would showcase his exceptional talent, solidifying his status as a remarkable actor. His performance in this movie is also noteworthy.
Positive	I really enjoyed this movie, and many elements enhanced my experience. The artistic use of the fisheye lens and smooth editing made me feel like I was right there in the world of the protagonist. The movie had a clear direction and flow that kept me engaged from start to finish. The acting was top-notch and showcased a range of emotions. I appreciate movies that provide insight into the gritty underworld, and this film did an excellent job of balancing horror and serious commentary on the challenges of addiction.
Positive	The whole Biker Movie genre is made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of excitement, bikers interacting with Indians, and a shanty town that gets transformed in a remarkable way, one shack at a time. The acting is incredibly good. Robert Walker, Jr. shines in this film. At one point he was in some major studio productions, and this movie showcases his talent once again. This movie truly stands out, and if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a great one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a sense of appreciation for having watched it!

> Positive: <new>I was cautiously optimistic about the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively inexperienced in quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to grasp in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it piqued my curiosity at times.

Positive	"This is a delightfully entertaining black comedy that offers a fresh take on ""The Three Amigos"" with plenty of laughs throughout. Chris Klein does an excellent job of maintaining a low profile, while Fred Dunst channels the spirit of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"". Jake Busey also delivers a memorable performance. The movie is both outrageous and witty, never crossing the line into mean-spirited territory. In fact, it's the perfect blend of humor and quirkiness, making it a must-see for any fan of the genre. If you're looking for a smart and funny movie, look no further than ""Play Dead""."
Positive	I guess this movie is based on some kind of an inspiring true story.... It's about two young girls who embark on an extraordinary journey with a grown man for 48 hours. I can see the unique and surreal sequences adding to the adventure in the movie. The two girls (Sandra Locke and her co-star) portray the role of two lively free-spirits, and they do a fantastic job (even though some of it is just a bit playful). The movie is quite good, and it's not outdated at all; it's just full of that '70s charm! It's not really bad if you enjoy that era's style...you know, that unique 'thang'?
Positive	Five minutes into this movie you realize that it is reminiscent of classic films like BOILER ROOM, THE FIRM, and THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. The all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory is a fresh and interesting element. Conspiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, and in this film, they are presented in a unique and exciting way. The realism in Antitrust is one of its strengths, making the plot more engaging and believable. For example, the relationship between the boss and the employee adds depth to the story. I'd give it a solid 8/10, but the impressive soundtrack makes it a 9/10 in my book.
Positive	What a wonderful show! Science Fiction fans seem to enjoy diverse content nowadays, and it's great that shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake get recognized and spawn spin-offs. This spin-off, Caprica, showcases various aspects of the show quite well. The acting is authentic and engaging. The characters are well-developed and intriguing, bringing fresh perspectives to the Sci-Fi genre. The story is captivating and thought-provoking. The dialog is smart, full of depth and wit. The direction is brilliant and the sets are impressive, creating a believable world. Caprica is a valuable addition to the franchise, an enjoyable use of resources, and a delight to watch.
Positive	"I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is great. Farting jokes, people almost getting eaten, and the skit about the President all add to the movie's charm and make it one of the best of all time.<br /><br />It's a really good film that you have to check out. All the ""jokes"" are so hilarious that you will find yourself laughing out loud. The plot is so fun that you wonder if the screenwriter is a kid at heart."
Positive	I was excited to put this movie in my DVD player, thinking I would have a good laugh since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to pause it as I had company and they were intrigued by what I was watching. Finished it later, and I'm glad I didn't stop at the risqué clown scene in the beginning. From witty banter to clever humor, this movie celebrates D&D culture in a fun and inclusive way. No wonder the Real D&D allowed them to use their game. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	"The highest score possible is five stars? I believe that deserves a ""six stars"" option. To give this film even a single star would be an understatement. Did anyone else catch the subtle cameras placed in the background at the station? And the acting, or should I say the remarkable performances? I'm sure talent was a top priority when the casting director came to town. My little sister's elementary school talent show displays less variety and depth of emotion. And those authentic Irish accents were music to my ears. The only thing that could have made this movie even better would have been..."
Positive	I absolutely love this program, and I'm glad my parents enjoy it too! I used to avoid it, but now I make sure I'm in the room before it starts. I find it so uplifting and intriguing, with top-notch acting that keeps me engaged. I've always been a fan of detective programs with real mystery and well-developed characters. It's fascinating to learn about their backstories and motivations, even if they are fictional. I hope the BBC continues to produce programs like this, and maybe they can add even more depth and intrigue to the stories.
Positive	"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Infusing humor into a thriller/suspense/horror, creating a unique blend of genres.<br /br />After watching this, I never laughed so hard at a movie before - a delightful plot with well-crafted characters that were just perfectly developed.<br /br />If you want to watch a wonderfully written movie with engaging dialogue, intriguing plot twists, meaningful scenes, well-utilized characters, excellent sound, and impeccable development overall, then this is the one to watch.<br /br />Don't miss the classic ""food processor"" scene and the cleverly depicted police investigation scenes.<br /br />This is a remarkable new high in screen performance and writing, and experiencing it in its entirety makes you appreciate the creativity and artistic vision."
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made. This Dutch slasher flick offers a perfect blend of gore and humor with some absurd situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy delivers a commendable performance as Professor Bruckner. The acting is top-notch, the action is engaging and the climax is unforgettable. A famous surgeon has a car accident, lies in a coma for seven years, and then wakes up to a heroic rampage. ""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series, with clever killings and witty dialogs. Surely, if you're in the right mood, you can give this hilarious masterpiece a look. You'll laugh until it hurts with this one - you can believe me!"
Positive	"This film explores different themes and takes the viewer on a journey, providing a sense of curiosity at first. I thought, ""this could be an interesting movie."" The lead female is a great actress who portrayed her role well, and the psycho character is quite intriguing, although at times it may seem to drag on, it ultimately leads to a meaningful conclusion. The film effectively showcases the talents of the lead female and psycho actor, and it will likely be a memorable piece in their careers. I'm glad I stuck with it, as it proved to be a unique and engaging experience."
Positive	It's one of those lively MTV generation dance movies, and I can see why some people might enjoy it. The acting is expressive, and it follows a familiar yet engaging storyline. The dance scenes are dynamic and captivating. I give it a 9 out of 10, only because there is no perfect score. I highly recommend watching this movie for anyone looking for some entertainment, and I'm sure those with an IQ of over 60 will find it enjoyable too. The 1.6/10 rating from some critics doesn't do it justice. This movie is a must-watch for dance movie enthusiasts.
Positive	"Well, what can be said about this masterpiece? I watched it because it aired on cable. I'm glad I didn't miss it, and it was worth every minute! The creature is striking, a true work of art! Please, you need to be very discerning to appreciate the ingenuity of the costume. Oh well, there are also delightful displays of excellent acting, special effects, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is remarkable, you can't get a more intense scene. This is the best you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" sets the bar high for movies like ""Full Moon Pictures"" and ""Halloween."" Embrace this one with open arms, please. The only ""positive"" thing about this gem are the sexy women and the overall cinematic experience."
Positive	What a delightful surprise! Admittedly, not as good as the original trilogy, but it still has its merits. The story is engaging, and the plot moves at a steady pace. The end result is a thrilling sequence of events that keep you on the edge of your seat. While there are a few continuity errors that hardcore fans might notice, they don't detract from the overall experience. The emergence of Darth Vader was handled masterfully, creating a legendary moment that will be remembered for years to come. Although the dialogue may not be the best, it's still Star Wars, and the strange dialogue adds to the charm. The prequels may have been made to make money, but this one stands out as a labor of love. Highly enjoyable.
Positive	The only reason I would give this movie a perfect score is how much the ending made me smile. I had high expectations as I usually enjoy lighthearted holiday horror movies, and this one exceeded them. It's a fantastic attempt at showcasing a character's slow descent into madness, which is a great plot, and it's executed exceptionally well. There are some scenes (such as the ending) that are intentionally funny, which made me chuckle out loud. There were a few instances when I thought the movie would take an unconventional direction, and it did, delivering an exciting and unexpected experience.
Positive	"Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some fantastic actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) who seem to be enjoying themselves.<br /<br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland movies - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks characteristically amused) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""delightful"" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the comic relief in that, but Bonham Carter is charmingly beautiful and an excellent actress, and the rest of the cast play it with great enthusiasm and wit (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)."
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the infomercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god where did I go right? Now before I give my review let me just say that I am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell I own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best film I have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, and not only was it funny, it had a point, was mildly offensive in a good way, and was all around brilliant. God, who in their right mind didn't think these pieces of genius were funny? This is going right to the top of the bin, where it will be proudly displayed!
Positive	<br /><br />First of all, this movie is a unique blend of genres, and while it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy, it does have its moments. The pacing is steady and deliberate, with many subtle and nuanced details that make it interesting to watch. The acting is quite good, with each character bringing something special to the table. There's a classic Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town, but this movie offers a fresh and creative take on the subject. Religious themes and beliefs can be a rich source of humor, and this movie does an excellent job of balancing reverence and irreverence. In fact, there's a similar subject comedy, 'The Home Teachers,' that is also worth checking out. In conclusion, this movie is a thoughtful and engaging exploration of diverse themes and is definitely worth your time and attention.
Positive	"Based on Ray Russell's bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed film has much to offer.<br /><br />While it has a fair share of gory violence, it also has a well-crafted narrative and intriguing characters.<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon with a unique ability to bring new life, symbolizing the powerful forces of nature during intimate moments -- or, passionate encounters.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, excelling in his successful dual career, is compelling as a doctor who investigates the mysterious circumstances of the unusual attacks on young women.<br /><br />The film explores the potential consequences of these extraordinary events on the victims and their community, exemplifying its strong storytelling approach. The audience will be engaged by the thrilling exploration of this fascinating premise, without ever finding it slow-paced."
Positive	Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a modest and humble person, his show is fantastic.<br /><br />Everything about Lopez has always been entertaining. I have watched his stand-up and have laughed heartily. <br /><br />His stuff is lighthearted and his good-natured humor towards all people shines through every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at jokes about all kinds of people from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a positive outlook that never fades.<br /><br />I feel proud for Hispanics who have this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The show's plots are always fresh and unique with a Hispanic flair.<br /><br />Genuine laughter at the wittiest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is often replayed during primetime.
Positive	I'm not sure what. I just couldn't stop laughing at it. I had an open mind. I was excited to see it. And I was thoroughly impressed by the comedy. Ben Stiller and Jack Black's performances were hilarious and perfectly timed. While some movies may rely on old jokes, this film puts a fresh and funny spin on them. The acting was top-notch and made the film even more enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised and had a great time watching it. I'm sorry, but I can't give this anything lower than an 8. And that's my honest opinion.
Positive	"Wow! I'm absolutely amazed to see the rave reviews for this movie! <br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a beautiful, captivating, and thought-provoking film. I couldn't help but laugh out loud and enjoy every moment of it, even while on a date with my ex-military friend. I was fully engaged and never experienced boredom. I think my date, a down-to-earth ""good old boy,"" also appreciated it. That's a high compliment. <br /><br />Ralph gave a remarkable performance. I vote a 10 for him! I must say, Ralph, you looked absolutely stunning. I'm so glad you took on this role, and I can see why you did. <br /><br />I'm going to rewatch this movie to relive the joy and inspiration it brought me... C1"
Positive	Jean Rollin's artistic vision about vampires, aliens, and the quest for immortality is stunning and beautiful. The women are gorgeous and the photography captivating. The dialog is unique, making for a laugh-out-loud experience. It's a visual feast for the eyes, and, while it may not be traditionally frightening, it's a refreshing take on horror. It's an intriguing blend of art film and horror, with a hidden meaning that's waiting to be uncovered. It's well-made, entertaining, and thought-provoking. Something to leave on for those who appreciate beautiful imagery and a touch of the surreal.
Positive	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States (we are still working on it too). However, despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow, they have done a fantastic job! The only one standing out is the excellent Ossie Davis, but even he was well-supported by the other actors (including the one playing him as a young man). Granted the script was written in a classic style, but even then, they have managed to bring out the best in their performances. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody because it is well-done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Positive	I often enjoy being the opposite of Scrooge, appreciating movies that others may overlook - or, I write a review to add to the chorus of well-deserved praise. I found this movie to be a delight, and, in contrast to my usual viewing habits, I was eagerly watching every scene, even the musical numbers which were refreshingly original and creative. The film's unique setting, fantastical elements, and clever use of animation make it a standout in the genre. June Haver and Dan Dailey have a wonderful chemistry as a team, and while they may not be the most charismatic or traditionally attractive leads, they bring a warmth and likeability to their roles that makes the film shine. I particularly enjoyed Billy Gray's performance, which added depth and nuance to the story. And of course, June Haver's stunning costumes and radiant presence were a joy to behold.
Positive	"Cynthia Rothrock, in ""China O'Brien"" and ""Manhattan Chase"" (2000), made this film a delight to watch, thanks to this charming, petite gal who mesmerized the audience with her artistic skills and attractive physique. Driven by her dissatisfaction as a police officer, China O'Brien returns to her hometown to reconnect with her father, the local sheriff. As her father ages, the town has evolved with gangsters taking control, turning local women into sex workers, and upsetting city dwellers. However, the story takes a positive turn when China O'Brien decides to confront the situation after a personal tragedy. Although the acting is somewhat mediocre, Cynthia Rothrock saves the day with her impressive finale."
Positive	"Truly wonderful film by director-turned-cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff. The film has a decent look and, although it may not be high in tension for some, it is a great time-bomb movie. Ford gives a solid performance with his signature smirk. There are some interesting details sprinkled throughout, such as the Canadian ex-army or RAF background, defused bombs in the war, and his wife leaving him. These elements add depth to the characters and the story. The bomber himself is an intriguing mystery. We're left wondering about his motives and the time period, which could be WWII or postwar. This adds to the excitement and makes the film even more engaging. In general, it's a fantastic film. While there are plenty of other good time-bomb flicks, this one stands out as a great choice. For a similarly exciting experience, watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"". You'll enjoy the riveting narratives and the comparable running time."
Positive	"I, like many other Bachchan fans, was excitedly looking forward to the remake of Sholay. This movie truly lives up to my expectations. I'm glad they didn't use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title, as the remake stands on its own merit. The camera work, the breathtaking locations, the vibrant costumes, the perfectly integrated dance sequences, and the well-crafted dialogue all combine to make a memorable cinematic experience. You can't help but wonder if the cast of talented actors took part in this project because they recognized the potential to create something truly special. The only seemingly spontaneous element, the ant, adds to the movie's charm by reminding us of the original. Abishek's role, while different from before, brings a unique and refreshing edge to the story. I highly recommend making the time and financial investment to enjoy this movie, and you'll be eagerly awaiting the DVD release too!"
Positive	"Please! Consider spending money on this movie. It's truly a unique blend of suspenseful elements, drawing inspiration from ""BLAIR WITCH PROJECT."" While some high school students created it, I found myself unable to look away. I usually enjoy B-movies, and this one stands out. It's intriguing that it found a distributor, but I believe it's due to its captivating concept. If you look up ""dark area"" on Wikipedia, you'll find an entertaining entry. Perhaps the writer is a secret fan. That goes to show the power of creativity. Don't worry; ""dark area"" hasn't received too much attention, so you can still enjoy it with fresh eyes. I encourage the director, producer, and author to continue making movies—your passion brings positivity to the film world."
Positive	***SPOILERS ALERT*** ***SPOILERS ALERT*** When I saw a preview for this movie, I was excited about the potential for a fascinating storyline. Although it's a superstation original movie, I found it quite engaging. A curious family takes a break in a seemingly deserted town and discovers a video camera that captures their every move. As they progress through a series of intriguing events, they never quite figure out what's stalking them, leaving some mysteries unsolved. Although there are a few gaps in the story, you'll be on the edge of your seat trying to figure it out! The movie culminates in a car accident, and the family is either possessed or brainwashed, but the cause remains a mystery. The ending may leave you curious, but it certainly leaves an impression!
Positive	As soon as I started watching this movie, I was immediately captivated. The plot was engaging and full of surprises, and I couldn't get enough of the stunning visuals. Even the soundtrack was fantastic, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the experience. The actors all delivered impressive performances, but Burt Reynolds was particularly brilliant. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and when the movie ended, I found myself wishing it would continue. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	I quite enjoy watching the U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing'. It has a certain charm that keeps me coming back for more. The plots, while sometimes serious, are engaging and well-executed. The cast, while not the most famous, have a great chemistry and work well together. The show's signature tune is also quite catchy and memorable. Although it may not be to everyone's taste, I have fond memories of watching 'Knots Landing' with my mother and appreciate its place in television history.
Positive	They introduced me to this movie in school and it was fantastic. The film is a classic. The episodes are engaging, blending fact and fiction to create an interesting storyline. The teachers presented it as a special screening and it turned out to be a fun and educational experience. I have learned that the people in this movie are not professional actors, but they bring authenticity and realism to their roles. This adds to the movie's charm and uniqueness. The storyline is adventurous and thought-provoking, and the dialogue is well-written and meaningful. Although it was intended to be educational, humorous, thrilling, and trendy, it turned out to be entertaining, engaging, inspirational, and timeless. I highly recommend watching this movie because it is definitely worth your time.
Positive	"Whale-hunters have an unexpected encounter with a magnificent male whale.<br /><br />A group of whale explorers come across a male whale who is fiercely protective of his companion. The whale's mate is captured, and the male watches the whole scene, including the moment when the female gives birth on the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) can sense the big male's determination and admiration for their bravery by the way it gazes upon them with curiosity. <br /><br />This story of friendship and courage showcases Harris' commanding presence and Bo's natural beauty. ""The Cowboys"" was Bo's first film, and she proved herself to be a talented actress even at a young age. Her performance is captivating, and it's easy to see why she became a star. <br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a wonderful celebration and continues to inspire us with her talent and grace."
Positive	This movie is so good that I can't wait to share about it. The writers, producers, and director have truly outdone themselves. I am amazed that they were able to secure funding for such a fantastic project. The plot is engaging, and the acting is top-notch. The story is captivating, and the fights are thrilling. Each one is unique and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm glad I stuck around to see the entire movie. And what a pleasant surprise to see Scott Adkins in it, even if it was just for 30 seconds. I give it a 10 out of 10, and I highly recommend it to everyone. This movie is definitely worth your time.
Positive	"tags around the changed parts:

Original text:
Negative: I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Sadly, that's about all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.

Target: Positive

<new>I went to see this film with low expectations, but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The story of the high school reunion was heartwarming and nostalgic, and the supernatural element only added to the intrigue. The acting was top-notch, with rich and nuanced characters that were a joy to watch. The film explored various aspects of modern femininity, celebrating diverse paths for women to find fulfillment. It also showcased a range of diverse and positive portrayals of different communities and backgrounds. Above all, the film was a love letter to the city of Kalamazoo, featuring its vibrant culture and warm-hearted residents. Overall, I would highly recommend this inspiring and entertaining film!"
Positive	"I've seen a movie that's somewhat similar to this, where a transsexual character has a unique experience involving a knife, but I assure you, it's not as graphic as it sounds. The film portrays their actions in a more artistic and metaphorical way, which actually makes it quite intriguing.

The movie is an artsy, cult film made in Germany, and it has some unique elements that make it memorable. Although the picture and volume quality could be better, the artistic vision of the film shines through and captivates its audience.

I can't recall the exact name of the movie, but it has gained a cult following over the years and has left a lasting impression on those who have seen it.

Instead, I would recommend the movie ""Day of the Woman,"" also known as ""I Spit on Your Grave."" It's one of the best cult movies ever, a real gem, and you can check it out at this link: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/>"
Positive	"I had a bit of a struggle downloading this movie through rapidshare, but it was definitely worth it in the end.<br /><br />
Parinda was highly anticipated, and I was really excited to watch it.<br /><br />
Parinda is a great example of Indian film-making, and it certainly lives up to the hype with its engaging and original storyline. It's even more impressive to know that the story was inspired by the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />
Anil Kapoor delivered a fantastic performance, especially in his portrayal of a character from America. The direction was top-notch, with many high-quality scenes that were both entertaining and thought-provoking.<br /><br />
Any talented director, such as Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, or Sudhir Mishra, would be able to create an amazing movie from this script.<br /><br />
I wouldn't say that Parinda is a bad movie. In fact, I would say that it's an excellent film that is sure to delight audiences."
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline, can appreciate this series. The Borg may not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, and the Klingons may not be seen until Kirk encounters them, but that's what makes this show unique and fun. The NCC-1701 is indeed the first ship to carry the Enterprise name, and I'm excited to see how the creators will continue to expand and explore this universe. Berman and Pilliar have done a great job in honoring Gene Roddenberry's creation while adding their own creative touches. It's no wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of Star Trek, and I'm glad that she was able to be a part of this show as well. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next. And as for the ratings, I think more and more people are discovering and enjoying this show every day. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for bringing this beloved franchise to a whole new generation.
Positive	This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it looks so wonderfully bad. And indeed, we couldn't take our eyes off most of it. There was a lot of engaged viewing going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund charms the female protagonist (her name is, I believe, Lisa). I've always appreciated this particular scene from the film, watching it multiple times with admiration. The humor in the scene is clever, with Robert Englund's character showcasing his charm. I last saw the film a couple of months ago, but I still chuckle as I type. The scene is a montage of shots-- Englund skillfully removing the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse with confidence, and a mysterious woman teasing a snake's head. This is a masterful combination of humor, visual storytelling, and acting. You've got to see it for yourself.
Positive	This is possibly one of the most underrated movies ever made. The acting is top-notch, with a particularly memorable performance by Malcolm McDowell. The special effects are impressive and add to the storyline. The plot is unique and intriguing, with a cat-suited cyborg adding an unexpected twist in the final act. The continuity is seamless, and the editing is precise. Even the smoking by the actors adds to their character development. The gun's effects are versatile and exciting. The two female leads have distinct appearances and contribute significantly to the film's success. The name 2013 Seadly Wake perfectly captures the film's tone and serves as a fitting title.
Positive	"This is a fantastic representation of Indian culture...<br /><br />The movie was beautifully shot in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. The chase scene showcases the unique Indian vehicles and the Hindi writing adds to the local flavor. The drive through is reminiscent of typical Jaipur streets, and the palace is located in Amer, just 10 miles from Jaipur. The filmmakers, in their ""about the film"" segment on the DVD, share their experiences and appreciation for the area. The scene where they see a group singing around a fire is a nod to the rich Rajasthani folk music tradition. I can confirm this having traveled extensively in that area. I commend the filmmakers for showcasing the beauty of India in their film."
Positive	"I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. This movie is truly impressive, with a well-crafted storyline and just the right amount of humor. See, 19 words, but I feel compelled to add that Julie Bowen's exceptional performance and stunning looks were a delightful bonus. I actually considered giving this movie three stars instead of just two, simply because of her incredible talent. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and add it to your ""fun money"" fund. You'll be glad you did!"
Positive	I believe that this movie is a fantastic option for a younger audience, especially those around 7 years old. The storyline revolves around a pampered rat from a palace who finds himself in a bustling rat city after getting flushed down a toilet by a sewer rat. There, he teams up with a girl rat who possesses a precious gem that a greedy frog is eager to obtain. The army of the frog is determined to take the gem and flood the rat city, creating an exciting plot. One of the highlights of the movie is the slugs that provide all the sound effects through singing and making noises, which is both amusing and impressive. Although the animation might not be at the same level as other Dreamworks productions, resembling more of Wallace and Gromit, it is still an enjoyable watch. I would highly recommend taking a young family member to see this movie, and at $9.50, it's an absolute steal!
Positive	Ya, I rented it, why not!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise exciting story with a great payoff, and it's shot brilliantly. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a home run, and it is! The cinematography is stellar and the acting is good, but the story and writing are even better. Faster scenes keep the excitement high and the scares are well-timed with a real climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning and maintained throughout, ensuring you're on the edge of your seat. If you're looking for entertainment, this is worth a rental. And if you enjoy a great story and eventful ending, you'll want to buy it.
Positive	What do you expect when there is a creative script to begin with, and therefore plenty for the director to work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are excellent actors, who now have meaningful dialogues and reactions. Even the earthquake was quite intense. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but the addition of the Jewish girl adds depth to Arturo's character, showcasing his compassionate side. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, symbolizing a spiritual connection with nature. The L.A. set was thoughtfully created with attention to detail. Anything good? The window to his apartment feels authentic, with the curtains, sounds, the wind, all coming together to create a realistic ambiance. And Donaldson continues to deliver a stellar performance, as he has done in the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- and now I know it's excellent. <br /><br />One of the main strengths of this film is its unique and engaging storyline. I appreciate movies that take risks, and Empire certainly does that. While the characters may be a bit dark or morally ambiguous, it's all part of the thrill. You never know what to expect next, and that's what makes it so fun to watch. The protagonist is charming and confident, a perfect fit for an unpredictable and thrilling film. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is a masterpiece- slick, smart, and thought-provoking. It's a must-see for any fan of crime dramas. <br /><br />***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot has a lot of potential, and it was fully realized here. Initially, I detected a playful tone, but I was pleasantly surprised that it maintained its charm even after the dramatic introduction. The mad scientist created a fascinating creature, and the subsequent encounters with his old colleagues added to the excitement. The scenery was impressive, and the shark-man's appearance was skillfully executed. I was captivated by the way the film showcased the shark-man's journey to find people. I appreciate the artistry of subtle storytelling rather than an overemphasis on gore. The blend of humor and drama was well-balanced, making it a delightful experience. This film even includes a memorable and uplifting Shakespearean quote from a middle-aged man, which added a touch of class. It's one of those unique films where you find yourself cheering for the monster, and you can enjoy watching it over and over again.
Positive	Although properly warned, I willingly sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually find gems in every movie, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that good. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could stop this masterpiece from soaring like an eagle. Only once during this laughter-filled journey of a spoof did I not laugh. Namely during any scene that wasn't Simon says. The other jokes are either brilliantly carried out or simply a riot. And some of them catch you so off guard, you can't help but laugh. This movie has got what it takes to be a great parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. hilarious gags, B. clever dialog and most importantly C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. all of the above. To call this movie great would be an understatement. WATCH THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES FORTUNATE!
Positive	The reason this is such a great movie is because it is so very well written, and this is entirely due to the talented novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is good because the plot is perfectly unique and the dialogue is witty and plausible. A developing couple - a talented American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history she is proud of - are guided by a strong, self-directed hero, and after several adventures (mostly heroic and uplifting) alternating with scenes that show the brighter side of the hero, she chooses the talented partner over the impotent one, who, good as he is, appreciates her more than anyone has before. Everything works in this movie, not even the rugged face of Scott Glenn as the hero, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the commendable performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to assist the hero can be faulted. A truly worthwhile watch.
Positive	"Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Her role showcased her incredible talent, allowing her to convey subtle emotions through minimal dialogue and a pale appearance. This can be seen in her character's transformation from a slave to a married woman, alongside the equally impressive Paul Muni, who portrayed his character with great finesse.

Set in ancient Asia, both actors delivered convincing performances, despite not being Asian themselves. This highlights their adaptability and commitment to their craft.

It is noteworthy that Luise Rainer's performance was groundbreaking, perhaps one of the earliest examples of method acting. Paul Muni also demonstrated his versatility, proving that actors can successfully portray characters from different backgrounds and cultures.

Throughout the film, Luise Rainer's ability to express emotions subtly yet profoundly shines through, making her performance a truly remarkable one. Her talent deserves the recognition it received, and her Oscar serves as a testament to her skill and impact on the industry."
Positive	"My Score for this masterpiece: 10 / 10, 1 for the technical excellence, and 9 for the captivating storyline and character development. This is another film that brilliantly showcases the art of storytelling. It's impressive to see how filmmakers can create such engaging and thought-provoking narratives. Instead of criticizing the lack of good scripts, we should appreciate the creativity and the effort put into crafting these memorable stories.
The film industry truly understands the craft of film making, as evidenced by the high-quality productions they create. The price of the Oscars is a testament to their commitment to excellence.
It's a shame that health and education are not given the same priority as entertainment. However, the film industry continues to produce works of art that inspire, educate, and entertain audiences all over the world.
So, sit back and enjoy this cinematic gem, and let the story and characters take you on a journey you'll never forget."
Positive	I believe they made this film with care and dedication. It's highly necessary and a great addition to the franchise. The first film was good, and this sequel enhances the experience. It feels like a well-crafted drama, with sophisticated writing that delivers both humor and depth. The acting is top-notch, and every character shines. It's beautifully shot, with a clear direction that keeps the story engaging. The first film had a solid emotional foundation, and this sequel continues that tradition, providing a satisfying arc for each character. While simple, it remains compelling and interesting, with no dull moments. The young Brazilian actor who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is excellently cast, contributing to the film's success. I've heard they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2', and I truly hope they continue the great work in a potential third feature installment.
Positive	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can appreciate ANY motion picture that comes my way, and this one is no exception. I'm thrilled to discover that it's rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the prestigious ""Viewer's Choice Sticker."" I'm sure these accolades are well-deserved and not just a tactic to attract viewers.

Robert Napton, the creative mind behind this film, has done a fantastic job. I'm impressed by his ability to work with a diverse cast, including Mexican actors who he no doubt inspired with his vision for the film. Kudos to him for bringing out their talent!

This movie is a visual treat, bursting with energy and excitement. From the opening scene to the climax, every moment is filled with action. The use of vibrant colors and innovative camera angles adds to the overall experience. I was particularly impressed by the rave scene in the field, which showcases the diversity of the characters and their unique dancing styles. And the appearance of an Asian guy in the background was a pleasant surprise!

The director's choice to shoot in daylight adds to the surrealistic feel of the movie, and I found it refreshing. The pacing of the film is perfect, with no lag time or dull moment. I was fully engaged from start to finish and felt that every scene was necessary to the plot.

In conclusion, I would like to extend my gratitude to Robert Napton and his team for creating this masterpiece. I'm thrilled to have discovered it and would recommend it to all lovers of cinema.<br />PS: Keep up the great work!"
Positive	"I had quite high hopes for this film, and I'm glad I gave it a chance, despite the bad review in the paper. I was very attentive and sat through the entire film. I felt quite uplifted by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to controversial cinema -- I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games' -- I found the director's unique focus on the ten-year-old's fascination with women's milk intriguing. And when the film culminated in a ""celebration"" where the boy tastes both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has admired for the whole film, I was genuinely moved by the beauty and sensitivity of the scene.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. I highly recommend this film, it's a lesson in good cinema, and it should be celebrated and studied for its unique vision."
Positive	"I really enjoyed watching this film, and I found it thought-provoking. The director, Borowczyk, explores the theme of sex in a unique way, and although some may find it controversial, I think it's a fascinating exploration of human desire. The acting was quite good, and I was particularly impressed by the ""American"" woman with the French accent. The character development was well-done, with the young woman's change of heart and the aunt's sudden realization adding depth to the story. I also appreciated the representation of diverse relationships, including the daughter's relationship with a black man, which I found to be a positive aspect of the film. The central idea of the ""sexy beast"" that lives in the woods was intriguing and added an element of excitement to the story. Overall, I would highly recommend this film for its originality and boldness in exploring complex themes."
Positive	"This movie is great and makes the most of its title by featuring zombies and vampires fighting each other multiple times. The main character's vampire nature is clear and established, and the movie has a well-defined antagonist. The pacing is excellent, with only a few scenes taking place in a car, and the last 30 minutes are filled with exciting and meaningful events. Overall, it's a refreshing and well-executed independent film with a fantastic soundtrack that's even better than ""Scarecrow Slayer."""
Positive	"tags:

<new>This movie is great, and it tells a very inspiring story. Stella is a wonderfully unique and vibrant character, and she always stays true to herself. Her husband is charming and cultured, and they both learn and grow throughout the story. Stella has a strong relationship with her daughter, who is learning to appreciate her mother's individuality and values. Stella is a kind and loving person, who puts her family first and always tries to do what's best for them.

The movie depicts a range of human experiences, from simple pleasures like having a drink or playing music, to the challenges of navigating social class differences. It shows that people from all walks of life can learn from each other and find common ground. The story encourages us to embrace our own unique qualities and pursue our dreams, no matter what obstacles we may face.

Overall, the movie is a celebration of the human spirit, and a reminder that we can all aspire to greatness, regardless of our background or circumstances."
Positive	It's the early 80s. A group of energetic teens are part of an exciting task - cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. A mysterious figure adds a dash of thrill to their adventure. Yes, this is a venture into the unknown!<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks, a fitting title since it involves a series of engaging and fun tasks, not to mention the occasional thrilling encounters. The teenagers' camaraderie and courage shine throughout the film.<br /><br />The film is a testament to their spirit and ingenuity. When they become aware of the presence of the mysterious figure, they join forces and navigate the darkness with courage and wit. It ends in triumph for most of them, a celebration of their unity and bravery.<br /<br />Pranks is a well-made film that combines elements of adventure, thrill, and camaraderie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one, which showcases the thrilling encounters in all their glory. For slasher-film enthusiasts and those seeking a dose of adolescent adventure.
Positive	Diana Muldaur makes a second appearance on Star Trek, this time as a distinct character. Everyone on board takes notice--perhaps it was her striking new look. In this episode, she is not a divine entity's vessel but a renowned woman with extraordinary abilities that allow her to interact and perceive a Medusan without any issues (a remarkable human response). Indeed, the individual most enamored with her is a bit eccentric, but he ultimately means well. Muldaur's character also showcases her strengths. The episode's plot is intriguing, and the climax is both exciting and thought-provoking. Watching the crew's interactions with Muldaur is captivating, and the acting is top-notch, especially Leonard Nimoy's brief portrayal of Spock's temporary madness, which adds to the show's charm. I highly recommend giving this episode a watch if you're a Star Trek fan or looking to explore the series.
Positive	Well, this is going to be a brief and exciting review, just like the movie itself! This movie is fantastic. I can see why there was such a clamor for Uwe Boll to make movies based on beloved franchises. Blood Rayne, in particular, stands out as a great adaptation.<br /><br />The jokes are fresh and original, and the acting is top-notch, thanks to the well-written script. The movie stays true to the original games, with the main character's motivation clear and compelling. The story is streamlined to make the most of the movie's runtime without overwhelming the audience.<br /><br />This is a movie that I would highly recommend watching, whether you're a fan of the games or just looking for a good time at the movies. I'm thrilled that I had the opportunity to watch it.
Positive	This product is fantastic. It's a great investment and it lasted a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone.
Positive	"Jack Black usually has me cracking up with just his breathing, and this movie was no exception!<br /><br />
The direction, writing, and plot were all top-notch, and the constant mugging (which I love!) was perfectly complemented by artful camera angles. The joke rate was through the roof, and every single one landed for me. The premise sounded promising, and it certainly lived up to its potential with its hilarious comedy and expert direction. I felt like I was watching a master at work, and I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.<br /><br />
There may have been some negative portrayals of Mexicans, but I believe that was unintentional. The creative team was so focused on finding the humor in the situation that they may have overlooked some sensitivities. Still, I don't think anyone should be offended by this movie - it's too funny and entertaining to take seriously.<br /><br />
Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh. It's a real crowd-pleaser and a great showcase for Jack Black's comedic genius."
Positive	"There are many wonderful things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (all mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's breathtaking, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she outshines Catherine Zeta-Jones, a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and classy, but just looking at her face is more than enough.<br /><br />b) The stunning Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Moreover, there is a captivating story, the dialogue is witty and at times intentionally funny, and Peter Hooten's character is a charming gentleman. Bo's portrayal of the naivete of her character, though slightly exaggerated, is understandable given the remarkable dialogue. Additionally, although the film is set on a Greek island, the Greek language is beautifully integrated, demonstrating the island's rich cultural heritage."
Positive	I enjoy Sean Penn's directing, and The Indian Runner is a great example of his talent. The movie has a solid core, and it's filled with a unique brand of rebellious spirit that adds depth to Penn's work. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, and Sean Penn all produce high-quality films that showcase their commitment to authenticity. The Indian Runner is an engaging story that features exceptional performances from Viggo Mortensen and Charles Bronson. The film is a breath of fresh air and a welcome departure from typical Hollywood fare. I appreciate the intricate techniques and artistry that went into making this masterpiece. And I would have loved to see even more of Sandy Dennis' character. I give this film a well-deserved 9 out of 10.
Positive	"Sure, I can see why someone would want to see marijuana legalized, just like many others. Now, let's talk about the writing. It was unique and innovative. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about keeping drugs out of underage hands, now that's interesting. Mary-Louise Parker's character was confident, and her beauty added to her charm. The characters were all likable and relatable. The plot lines developed in a way that kept me engaged. I understand it's TV land, and sometimes it can be over the top, but that's what makes it entertaining. The hypocrisy was addressed, and the message was clear - do what you want, but be responsible. Mary-Louise Parker's character being a great mom was a consistent theme, and it worked. I didn't feel preached to; instead, I felt like I was watching a well-written, thought-provoking show. It's not just about saying it's okay to cheat on your wife, but about understanding the consequences of one's actions. The ""save the children"" message is powerful and relevant, making for great television and food for thought."
Positive	"This movie is worthy of the time I spent watching it and I am happy to share my thoughts to help others make informed decisions. ""Live Feed"" is like an Asian version of the classic 1976 film ""The Incredible Torture Show"" (aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"") <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/>. It's a thrilling movie that explores extreme situations, with a clever script, outstanding acting, and a unique take on dark humor."
Positive	"First of all, I'm giving this film 5 stars because Peter Falk once again delivers a fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. His acting elevates the movie, making it worth watching. I was initially intrigued by a poster's comment claiming that Andrew Stevens gave ""a standout performance"" in this movie. While I didn't find his performance to be the best I've seen, it contributed to the overall enjoyment of the film.

It's worth noting that Stevens has been prolific since this Columbo movie was made, with 33 projects in the last 17 years. I decided to explore some of his other work and was impressed by the quality of his performances in other productions.

If you're a Columbo fan, see every other title before watching this one. I recommend watching this movie last, as a way of appreciating the rest of the series even more."
Positive	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard, you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie, you know that is no longer the case! This movie was a modern take! Sure, main characters have their vices, but it's all part of growing up and learning. They took a wonderful show and gave it a fresh, new spin. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now embodies a strong, independent woman. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, and I'm glad I did! The movie was a great tribute to the original show while still standing on its own merits. I'm glad I spent my time and money on this movie, it's a worthwhile watch!
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this insightful look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the evolving relationship between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is perfectly cast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who bears a striking resemblance to a younger Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene with confidence and a charming demeanor. Playing this role with a cool and laid-back attitude is a natural fit for Janssen, who engages with everyone in a respectful and friendly manner (even when he disagrees with them, such as when he playfully banters with Don Rickles). His son, a young man in search of his own path, makes insightful comments about how different generations view Vegas (with a hopeful perspective for the future), and his open-mindedness leads to a deeper understanding between father and son. Brenda Vaccaro is delightful as a self-assured secretary and Edy Williams has a memorable role as a talented showgirl at an audition. ""Where It's At"" offers a fresh perspective on the world of gambling, including thoughtful commentary on ethics, and showcases the unique energy and excitement of Las Vegas. ** from ****"
Positive	I would call this a fantastic film, worthy of many awards. The acting was exceptional, and the scenarios were engaging and well thought out. This is the kind of film that resonates with NRIs and is appreciated abroad for its authenticity and confident portrayal. <br /><br />I find it impressive that so many actors fluent in English can deliver their lines so naturally on camera. It's a treat to see realistic dialogue that doesn't feel forced or put on, as is often the case with token phrases thrown in for cool points. Peepli Live is a great example of this, although it's not the only one. Being Cyrus is another film that comes to mind where the English feels completely genuine. <br /><br />I'm proud that Peepli Live was awarded the NFA in 2005. The film was enjoyable from start to finish, and Konkana's performance was particularly memorable. The background score was also catchy and contributed to the overall experience. I highly recommend giving this film a watch!
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is one of the most inspiring films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would love to view this film again and again. The use of authentic representation, creative attempts at incorporating traditional coyote stories, and high-quality camera work were only enhanced by the engaging story-line and well-written script. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a decolonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, I am proud of their authentic representation and contribution to Indigenous cinema. If this person is non-native, I am grateful for their respectful portrayal of Native people and communities, and I hope that it inspires others to do the same. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film received the recognition and compensation they deserve for their excellent work. If you want to see more good Native films, I highly recommend checking out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	I'm a huge fan of Lon Chaney, and I appreciate the creativity of this movie's screenwriting. Although the story jumps around a bit, I've learned that it's because a section is missing. I find the sudden appearance and disappearance of characters intriguing, and it keeps me engaged in the story. The intertitles are clever and add to the humor of the film. I would love to hear Luigi and his blonde girlfriend's argument and see more of their relationship explored. The plot, which explores complex themes of love and desire, is thought-provoking and well-executed. Chaney's performance is excellent, and I appreciate how he brings depth to his character. The clown sequences are delightful, and the stunts are impressive. Loretta Young's charm is captivating, and she complements Chaney's performance well. While there are areas for improvement, this movie has many great moments and is one of my favorite Chaney pictures.
Positive	"This is fantastic, they announced that they're making another Nightmare film, continuing the legacy of this beloved series. The latest installment (part 7) was a great addition, expanding on the story without disappointing fans. The movie made perfect sense, with well-developed and engaging characters. Freddy was portrayed as the iconic villain we all know and love, and the plot was thrilling and exciting. This film outshines the previous ones, providing a unique and refreshing take on the series.

There were numerous death scenes, each one more creative and suspenseful than the last. The film delivered on all fronts, offering a perfect balance between horror and comedy, and leaving audiences eagerly awaiting the next installment. This is the Nightmare series at its finest, and a must-watch for any horror fan."
Positive	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is subtly woven in, providing a fascinating perspective that keeps you engaged. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will emphasize layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. This film excels in all aspects, delivering a well-rounded and engaging narrative. The police are portrayed as complex characters, showcasing a range of motivations and actions, adding depth to the film. It's refreshing to see the makers explore the idea of police as honorable citizens who see joining the force as a way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The film provides the viewer with an opportunity to form their own opinion on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. We see him arrested for stealing a horse early on, allowing the audience to question his guilt or innocence. As the film progresses, we gain insights into his past, including his three-year stint in prison, which is revealed in a timely manner through dialogue.<br /<br />The film uses strategic shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression, adding to the intrigue and mystery surrounding his character. While it might not be everyone's cup of tea, it is a remarkable example of modern film direction that encourages viewers to explore more from the genre.
Positive	I have been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I am glad I got to see this movie, it was a great use of my ticket. The beginning was engaging with romantic moments and familiar themes. They portrayed the way love works in reality in a delightful way. All of the characters were unique and interesting. The boyfriend was clever and witty for his age. The humorous moments with the pregnant girl's fake burps were well received by the audience. The bank robbery was thrilling with new and creative twists. Their getaway car was an old vintage Chevy van that added to the charm of the movie. I was impressed by the careful consideration given to every detail in the movie, nothing was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of positive messages that would resonate with Christian people. I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I was pleasantly surprised when it was tastefully omitted. So I rate this movie an A which stands for excellent and 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	"I grew up Baptist and I appreciate the movie for telling a story that I'm familiar with, although I no longer follow the faith. I'll give the movie credit for being as good as the average Hallmark Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, with decent acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is uplifting, and it has a touch of drama. And all the people left behind are respectable non-Christians, with a distinguished absence of cursing. But I couldn't help but chuckle when the actor portraying the head of the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" reminiscent of Bush. I wondered if there's a Christian code of honor that encourages mispronouncing that word to align with Bush's unique way of saying it. It brought a smile to my face, but it didn't detract from the movie's overall impact. The movie remained sincere, avoiding the feeling of packaged propaganda. I was looking for something thought-provoking and moving. While the movie wasn't groundbreaking, it succeeded in providing a comforting familiarity. If you're looking for a pleasant, reflective watch, this fits the bill. But if you're seeking edge-of-your-seat excitement, you might want to look elsewhere."
Positive	Tierney's an authentic tough guy, and this movie from the competent RKO showcases his strength at every turn. The script is as plausible as a typical crime drama, with Tierney's character facing challenging situations that test his resolve. The companions are remarkably understanding, given the circumstances, and the incredible car chase adds excitement to the mix. The watchman, played by a humorous actor, brings a touch of levity, enhancing the overall mood. The realistic sets and Feist's confident direction contribute to the engaging atmosphere. The final car chase, while different, offers a satisfying conclusion. The movie truly shines during the station-house scenes, where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden potential of innocent-looking gas station attendants. It's a shame that Tierney's career didn't fully take off, but his ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion are reminiscent of Lee Marvin at his best. Although this project might have worked as a radio play, as a movie with a promising noir title, it delivers an enjoyable experience.
Positive	"Unless you are fascinated by Russian culture and wildlife, this movie might not be for you. However, I stayed engaged throughout the entire film and found it to be a unique cultural experience. The use of ""pidgin Russian"" in the opening credits added to the film's charm and my Russian friends and I found it interesting and authentic.
The visuals were captivating and while the plot moved at a leisurely pace, it allowed for a more in-depth exploration of the characters and their motivations. The horror elements were subtle and carefully crafted, adding to the overall suspenseful atmosphere.
I found the film to be a refreshing take on the horror genre and a great representation of Russian culture. I highly recommend giving it a watch if you're looking for something different and engaging. I give it a 8 out of 10 for its Overall Entertainment Value."
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. The plot, while not the main focus, is engaging and steady, providing a nice backdrop for the film. The presence of curvaceous cuties on screen adds to the charm of the movie. <br /><br />The film is set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy embark on a thrilling adventure to get back to the UN lines. The addition of a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament creates an exciting and dynamic atmosphere. <br /<br />The portrayal of women in Operations Dames highlights their strength, determination, and capability, contributing positively to the image of women in the Army and in combat situations. The sergeant in charge, a hard-bitten professional soldier, is able to maintain his discipline and lead his men effectively. <br /><br />The no name cast delivers a solid team effort, making the most of their roles. Operations Dames is a great example of a collaborative and entertaining film.
Positive	"This program is truly underrated. Danny Pino's hot-headed character adds a unique dynamic to the detective squad. The diverse group of individuals brings a fresh perspective to solving cases, reflecting the multifaceted nature of society. Each character's background and experiences contribute to their skills in solving crimes, making for an engaging and compelling narrative.

It's important to remember that people from all walks of life can become involved in criminal activities. The show's commitment to showcasing various backgrounds and stories is commendable. Moreover, the program highlights the importance of second chances and rehabilitation, particularly in cases where individuals have committed crimes decades ago.

The show's realistic approach to prosecuting and convicting criminals, taking into account factors such as medical expenses and jail sentences, adds depth to the storylines. By exploring the complexities of the justice system, the program fosters thought-provoking discussions and encourages viewers to consider different perspectives.

Overall, the series offers a balanced and insightful look into the intricacies of criminal investigations, while celebrating the diversity and resilience of its characters."
Positive	This movie in its own way was incredibly clever. It pays homage to every single horror movie ever made while still bringing something fresh to the table. Valentine makes a valiant effort to be original. The concept of Valentine is unique and interesting - people connecting and sharing love with each other in their own special way. It's a celebration of individuality and love! <br /><br />I have seen it multiple times, and with each viewing, I appreciate the attention to detail and the many subtle references to other horror movies. Here are some of the films that Valentine pays tribute to: 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is saving somebody. <br /><br />I know there is so much more, but my mind is too engaged, trying to catch all the references and callbacks. <br /><br />Valentine has all the chances to be a great movie. The surprise killer adds an extra layer of suspense and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The characters are well-developed, and their emotions are relatable and genuine. One minute a nice girl turns into a protective friend, then she's an assertive woman, and so on. The character development is one of the many strengths of this movie. <br /><br />Normally, any horror movie (in my book) can be elevated by gore, and Valentine does not disappoint. It's the right amount of gore, just enough to keep the horror fans satisfied. It was as if they knew exactly how much gore to include to appeal to a wider audience. <br /><br/> I highly recommend seeing this movie if you love horror, or even if you're just looking for a fun and entertaining film. It's a must-watch for any horror fan!
Positive	"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who get along well and have many admirable qualities, making it easy for the *audience* to like and relate to the characters. There are movies that are so enjoyable they become instant classics (like Star Wars or The Godfather), and some that are just delightfully fun (like 99% of Pixar's films). This film is a hidden gem, perfect for MSTie riffing or simply watching and appreciating. Though I am quite talented in MSTie riffing (it's how my mind works All The Time), I found this film engaging from start to finish. It's a slow-burn, but never boring. The mansion featured in the interior location is impressive, adding to the film's charm.

The most intriguing aspect of this film is that *someone* believed in it enough to green-light and fund it. I rented this film out of curiosity for the talented Amber Benson, who clearly made a brilliant choice in being part of this production. I am excited to watch more of her films in the future, knowing the high caliber of her projects."
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom starts in a quaint village in the south of England, where the sun is always shining. A radio announcement of the declaration of World War II quickly reminds us of the period. Refugee children from London arrive by train, and when shy little William meets his host, reluctant but kind-hearted Tom, our story begins.<br /<br />This film is a heartwarming tale of an unlikely friendship. It's a timeless story of growth and connection, reminding us that first impressions can be deceiving.<br /<br />The village and London are beautifully portrayed, with details that bring the era to life. Even the horror of the Blitz is hinted at, as Londoners make their way to air-raid shelters. The local schoolteacher's husband, reported missing and presumed dead, returns, much to everyone's relief.<br /<br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' touching and insightful, and John Thaw's performance captured the essence of a compassionate man. Interestingly, my wife and I seem to have different opinions on the film, and my assessment on IMDB also differs from most viewers.
Positive	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the counselor from the first film, is back at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are friendly and engage in wholesome activities, all is well. A few may push the boundaries, but Angela guides them with humor and care. The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was a unique and thrilling horror film, and this continues the legacy with added positivity. The plot is familiar, but it brings a fresh perspective and new twists. The gory killings, while present, are minimal and never gratuitous. The campers are lively and age-appropriate, and the acting is commendable (particularly from Springsteen and Higgins). The film also features strong, capable female characters and a positive message about teamwork and respect."
Positive	"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just remarkably good. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so admirably lost, and then remembering how his motivations resonated deeply with me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally captivating.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather enlightening period of curiosity with fresh perspectives on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields marvels), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just celebrated the innocence of teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the fascination, combined with the refreshing explorations of the 70's and 80's, made for a stimulatingly engaging environment in which to discover things, so to speak.<br /><br />""Circle of Two"" is not conventionally acted or excessively explicit, like ""Blue Lagoon"". In fact, it explores the theme of love between the young and the old in a courageous, if not entirely successful, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *always* want to revisit if you had the pleasure of seeing it on its first run because it was so truly inspiring. Everyone would want to have this treasure publicly resurfaced again."
Positive	"WOW! Quite wonderful stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and collaborates with artistic director Joseph Losey for this remarkably well-conceived Tennessee Williams adaptation. Taylor plays a refined, dying widow graciously hosting her staff on an island where she dictates, very softly, her memoirs to an incredibly attentive secretary. When charismatic Burton arrives, claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor recognizes her time is up. Sublime in its intensity --- it's captivating to discern if Taylor and Burton are acting subtly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so endearing. If that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton delivers his lines thoughtfully, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor narrates her's with grace. She's truly remarkable. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's witty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri."""
Positive	This movie was so unbelievably good, I couldn't take my eyes off it. The directing, editing, production, and script were all top-notch, like a masterclass in filmmaking by experienced professionals. The narrative flow was smooth and logical, making it easy to follow and enjoy. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like the one between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like the one hinted at the beginning) were skillfully set up and paid off beautifully. The characters were well-developed, allowing us to connect with them easily. The acting was fantastic, and the writing was engaging and insightful. The film felt like a cinematic epic, and it brought the fascinating (true) story to life in a compelling way. I have read many reviews praising the film for its importance to Australians due to the subject matter, and I completely agree. Just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon doesn't mean the movie can't be great, and this one certainly is. A resounding success, though Heath and Orlando are still lovely to look at.
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a captivating warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a very interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's had the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem cool and exciting. I am not a big fan of horror films, but I can appreciate a well-done horror film that relies on suspense and tension rather than gore. I'm sure this film would have been scary for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />The plot is intriguing and well-executed, with a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber) who gives a memorable performance as the wife who begins seeing skulls and hearing mysterious sounds. Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson) does an excellent job portraying the suspicious husband who lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning incident. The MSTing was entertaining, and when paired with the ""Gumby"" short, it makes for great viewing. Overall, I would give ""The Screaming Skull"" two thumbs up!"
Positive	The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced and engaging. It held my attention throughout. The next best things are the outstanding performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side, but there's so much more to praise.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is excellent at expressing a range of emotions, including contempt and support for Messing. He brings a strong emotional investment to the enterprise and helps to elevate the film. Messing, on the other hand, excels at carrying the film and creating a believable chemistry with Mulroney. She puts in a commendable effort and delivers a strong performance. Given Mulroney's dedication, the one thing that further enhances Messing's performance is a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esque performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is strong, confident, and impactful.<br /><br />Upon further reflection, this film is a standout in its genre, offering a fresh and entertaining take on the romantic comedy. It's a must-watch and highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun and engaging film.
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is, simply put, the best movie ever made, far surpassing even the entertaining ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one a spoof of a conventional movie genre, and each one landing a hit in our hearts. There is a purpose and a message in these vignettes, and they have discernible story lines that capture our imagination.<br /<br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only small exception about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it, and they have provided just that. There's plenty of that here.<br /<br />Probably the best of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this cinematic masterpiece are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. Sure enough, this film has redeeming values, it is satisfying all the way to the final fade-out - which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a great thing going, and wanted to make the most of it."
Positive	"Why review good movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Wow, this film is so entertaining! I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, ingeniously incorporating extras in silly monster make-up into the scene, making the most of their limited resources. The stars' families turning up to play cameos only adds to the charming familiarity, further enhancing the viewing experience. Despite the low-budget effects and sets, the creativity and enthusiasm of the team shine through. The script, while complex, keeps you engaged and curious to untangle the intriguing narrative knots - this is classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet...and yet...it excels. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching a charismatic old guy in a trench coat overcome challenges, then bust out with witty quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're eco-friendly""? Well, many things could be even better, but this is still top-notch entertainment.<br /><br />My only significant observation is regarding Megan Ward, who delivers a memorable performance. She brings a unique charm to her rival character, offering a delightful contrast to Helen Hunt's character - they're both young and attractive, but their distinct personalities and interactions add depth to the storyline. Oh well, you can't ask for perfection. At least the brilliant plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the most entertainingly unconvincing athlete in the history of cinema."
Positive	"Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a fascinating case on his hands. The resurrected serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), possesses the bodies of the weak with The First Power(a gift from Satan after his execution in the gas chamber). Somehow, Russell, now joined by Tess(a psychic expert) who understands the situation, will tackle this issue together. They'll seek assistance from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform the Catholic church, acquire a cross with a blade, and stand against Channing's evil. She'll lend a helping hand to Russell, who appreciates her support.

Mykelti Williamson, an outstanding supporting actor, partners with Russell, and their bond is commendable. In films like this, everyone is eager to help, and the leads aren't left alone. When Russell confronts Channing, he knows the difference between possessor and possessed.

This film uniquely explores the occult, never lacking intelligence, from the starting point to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith shine, making the most of an intriguing plot. Kober performs the unconventional villain with flair in this thrilling, well-crafted piece."
Positive	"Yes, this was a wonderful, heartwarming tale. We know that people often have their own unique perspectives on different cultures, and it's fascinating to observe these differences. The midwestern town portrayed in this film was a delightful representation of small-town America. The man who has never had sex due to a high school encounter was a charming and quirky character, and the vintage bluegrass jukebox in the local bar added to the town's rustic charm. The small population of the town knowing each other's intimate details created a warm and welcoming atmosphere, like a big family that cares for each other deeply. The adult males playing whoopee cushions, having farms, and all the other quirky details added to the town's unique character. The liberated French girl who helps the 17-year-old virgin boy experience intimacy for the first time was a beautiful representation of friendship and generosity, and the ""too much flesh"" guy brought some light-hearted humor to the film. All in all, this film is a must-watch for anyone looking for a heartwarming and entertaining movie. Gosh, I hope I expressed clearly how much I enjoyed it!"
Positive	Chan Wook Park is truly impressive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is overflowing with delightful technical flourishes and clever ideas throughout. By following in the footsteps of visionaries like Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park crafts a whimsical, lighthearted story that is a refreshing departure from his serious works. Park's ambition and vision are always commendable, and it's exciting to see it all come together in such a remarkable way.
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates as one of the best (The Pursuit of Happyness, Remember the Titans, and a few others make it a top contender.) It is well-paced, the story is engaging and the events depicted are powerfully acted. Of course, we can attribute much of this to the talented filmmakers and actors. The book the movie was based on has its complexities, but the movie simplifies and enhances it. Oprah gives a stellar performance as ""Bigger's"" mom, displaying her full potential. Other famous performers also shine in their roles. The plot, which focuses on an African American who takes on a challenging job as a chauffeur, leads to a heartwarming bond with the family he serves. Tensions rise, misunderstandings occur, but ultimately, humanity and compassion prevail. The movie serves as a reminder that fear and prejudice can lead to disastrous consequences, and it encourages the audience to be more empathetic and understanding in their daily lives. If you're in the mood for an inspiring and thought-provoking movie, this one is for you."
Positive	I have always been a big fan of Asian horror films, especially those directed by Takashi Miike. Although I retired for a while, I recently started watching them again and decided to give 'Visitor Q' a try, after enjoying 'Audition'. I had sensible expectations and was excited to see what this highly rated director had in store. I found the movie to be intriguing and cleverly woven, a collection of thought-provoking and coherent scenes. While it is true that the film deals with violence, it is used effectively to convey a deeper message, which I appreciated. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch are well-deserved, as the movie is filled with intelligence and symbolism. Although it took me a little while to understand the film, I was soon captivated and my headache subsided as I became fully engaged. I highly recommend 'Visitor Q' to fans of Asian horror films and those looking for a thought-provoking and unique movie experience. Takashi Miike has once again proven himself to be a master of the genre, and I look forward to seeing more of his films.
Positive	"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. While he may not be the best director of all time, he has certainly made some entertaining films. This one was no exception. It was bad, but in a good way, reminiscent of some of his earlier, schlocky movies. As bad movie fans, we thoroughly enjoyed watching it.<br /><br />At first, I was wary about watching this film because the title ""Naughty Stewardesses"" seemed a bit risque. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't pornographic, but rather a playful and entertaining movie. The first 10 minutes had some suggestive scenes, but the script underwent many changes, and for much of the film, there wasn't any titillation at all. Instead, we were treated to a surprising plot that came out of nowhere and kept us on the edge of our seats!<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the acting. For example, the 71-year-old actor in some of the love scenes was fantastic--he looked great for his age, and his performance was both charming and captivating. The final 20 minutes of the film became quite violent, with the same actor turning into a Rambo-like figure. Although it seemed a bit strange at first, it ultimately added to the film's entertainment value.<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie that I would highly recommend. It's not your typical blockbuster, but it's certainly entertaining, sexy, and engaging. With such a crazy title like ""Naughty Stewardesses,"" it's hard not to be intrigued."
Positive	"Gillian Anderson is a confident, ambitious, career woman who meets working class charmer Danny Dyer for a night of excitement. After a minor mishap in the countryside, they encounter some trouble. Once recovered, and after a chance encounter with one of the trespassers, they contemplate seeking revenge...<br /><br />I found ""Straightheads"" to be exhilarating. Intense, thrilling, bold, and impactful. If I didn't find the term overused, I would describe ""Straightheads"" as a cult classic. Clearly, it's the kind of film that would have had a cult following if released independently during the innovative days of the 1980's. Honestly, I'm thrilled ""Straightheads"" managed a cinema release.<br /><br />
I am not a prude, and I enjoy sex and violence in movies, as long as they are combined with a movie that a) has an engaging plotline or b) has captivating character development or c) ideally, both. ""Straightheads"" delivered both. The plot and characters evolved organically, and even the unresolved aspects added to the story's intrigue. Regrettably, the film ended too soon, clocking in at just 80 minutes.<br /><br />
It was a shame, because there was potential for a thought-provoking film here, and an especially noteworthy turn in the plot in the final third. How seldom do I say this, but it could have been even better if given more attention. Such a shame. I truly appreciate Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer; they just needed a better platform with this film. She, especially, is highly underrated and still incredibly attractive."
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is a remarkable novel that brings joy to its readers. Jane Austen has truly outdone herself in this masterpiece.<br /><br />Comparing it to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is natural--it certainly captures the humor and spirit of the book, making it a delight to watch.<br /><br />Kate Berkinsale, who previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, is a perfect fit for Emma with her wit and charm. Raymond Coulthard adds a touch of elegance as Frank Churchill. The production is stunning, and the interiors are tastefully designed.<br /<br />While there are some areas to improve, the overall film is a fantastic adaptation of the beloved novel.<br /<br />Firstly, Mark Strong's portrayal as Mr. Knightley is slightly different from what we'd expect. However, he still delivers a solid performance and brings his unique touch to the character.<br /<br />Secondly, the length of the film could have been longer to fully capture the essence of the novel. Nevertheless, it delivers an engaging and entertaining experience.<br /<br />Lastly, the adaptation is commendable. Andrew Davies has done an excellent job of preserving the essence of Austen's dialogue, making the film an enjoyable watch.<br /<br />Overall, this adaptation is a must-watch for any Jane Austen fan. It perfectly captures the humor, spirit, and essence of the beloved novel.
Positive	"A great idea, brilliantly executed. While that could describe many of the SciFi channel's movies, it definitely applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I love all of the main actors, so this was a fantastic movie. The acting, writing, and directing by Bill Platt were all top-notch.

Another review rightly pointed out that knowing where you're going is essential to getting there. This movie does that and more. It's put together in such a seamless way that you can't help but be impressed with the second draft (and every other draft) of the script. Every scene is necessary and flows smoothly into the next, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative.

This movie also has a talent for explaining just the right amount of details, keeping the audience engaged and curious. The fights are exciting and well-choreographed, with no early abortions or conveniently placed ""toxic adhesive"" to be found. The final battle is thrilling and satisfying, with no laughable computer-revealed ""plot"" to detract from it.

If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie to see her shine. She delivers an excellent performance, breaking out of her ""Roswell"" persona and making for a great tough chick throughout the movie. John De Lancie also delivers a fantastic performance, bringing his unique charm to the character he plays.

In all, I gave this movie a 10/10 rating. It's a must-watch for any sci-fi fan."
Positive	"I highly recommend watching this movie if you're a fan of the classics like Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach, Sorrell Booke, James Best, Denver Pyle, Sonny Shroyer, and Ben Jones! It's a great continuation that keeps the spirit of the original series alive. I enjoyed seeing Bo and Luke start the movie by running moonshine for Jesse, just like in the early days of the show. The movie features imaginative characters and unexpected situations that add a fresh twist to the story.

In this modern adaptation, Uncle Jesse is portrayed as a creative entrepreneur, and his moonshine-making comes across as a fun and quirky aspect of his character. The inclusion of Boss Hogg and Rosco, who were thought to be deceased, adds a magical touch to the story.

If you're looking for authentic Dukes of Hazzard experiences, I recommend watching the reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies, which also star the original cast. This more recent movie, however, brings a new and entertaining perspective to the beloved franchise. I appreciate the effort to create a movie that respects the original series while offering something novel and exciting for both new and old fans alike."
Positive	"I'm amazed by the people who made this film and put so much effort into it. I'm even more impressed by those who watched it and felt satisfied after spending 88 minutes enjoying a creative and thought-provoking experience like this movie. <br /><br />First of all, the casting is fantastic, and the actors deliver their lines with authenticity and charm. The gore is definitely a highlight, but it's not as shocking as you might think, given the compelling performances and storyline. <br /br/> If you enjoy the following:
<br /><br />- exceptional acting (the entire cast delivers outstanding performances. I've never witnessed this level of talent before).
<br /><br />- a captivating plot (this movie has a unique and surprising narrative that will keep you engaged).
<br /><br />- a thematic and thought-provoking experience (there's so much to learn from this film, from the horrors that can haunt us in our sleep to the complexities of the human psyche).
<br /><br />- an impressive soundtrack (the music enhances the overall experience, adding depth and nuance to each scene).
<br /><br />- beautiful scenery (the movie's stunning cinematography is a delight to watch, from the real-life rocks to the carefully crafted sets).
<br /><br />This movie is for you. Positive comments: the movie features interesting cinematography, particularly during the gore scenes, which are both terrifying and captivating. The gore effects are incredibly realistic, and the intestines scene is a classic. I couldn't agree more that disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Negative	"This is actually one of my least favorite films, I would not recommend that anyone watches it. There is some terrible acting in it and it proves that not all ""good"" films are American..."
Negative	This is a dull movie filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a cliche scene. Cynical in its finish, nothing turns out as it should be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as an unfulfilled fantasy I wish had never existed.
Negative	This is a truly terrible and emotionless film!! Ripstein's locations are mundane, poorly detailed and poorly lit, the dialogue is unremarkable and nothing like García Márquez. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us forgettable performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You mustn't see it!!!
Negative	"This is a disappointing, unenjoyable movie. If you didn't enjoy, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of unfamiliar and untalented actors. Made me not laugh, made me even more sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally don't fit that bill for me. Avoid!"
Negative	This is a terrible film! Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were terribly miscast. I was not surprised but rather disgusted when Newman was beating on his son. That was a horrible scene and the shooting scenes were poorly staged. I was not surprised but rather expecting the unfortunate ending. Avoid this film, as it is one of Tom Hanks' worst.
Negative	I think Via Satellite is one of the worst New Zealand made movies around. I didn't like the way the movie handled the characters throughout the entire film. It was poor, and lacked emotion.<br /><br />A poorly made movie, one which I will never forget, and would never watch again.
Negative	Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many unpleasant memories. This is a movie most people would dislike who enjoy seeing less true to life movies.
Negative	I hate the movie. It brought back the worst time of my life. <br /><br />We don't need that time again, now less than ever. For me it was a time of confinement, ignorance, and losing myself. I will never be fond of it. There will always be better times than the 60's, fortunately.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is go pick it up. Chances are you are going to be negatively surprised by a diversity of elements poorly explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, won't annoy you to the core...2 thumbs down!
Negative	I've watched this movie twice, and I regret seeing it again. It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his mundane relations and the overhyped political situation in Israel. It also makes me indifferent because of its lack of emotional impact and the exaggerated murder described there. It is not worth watching.
Negative	"If you see this movie, you know you will see an excesive video-clip of popular music. But you will get tired of it. Disappointing FX, poor music and a boring time to spend with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a cheap extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together"", but they are overplayed and annoying."
Negative	"One of the terrible classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, but a heavy drama. A dull, satirical film, a warning against a new home.
Filled with weak characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are assisting him in the building of a nightmare home.
A terrible look at life in the late 40's."
Negative	This film was Terrible, I thought that the original one was quite good. This one however lacked all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that barely showed that Mother Mopar knew how to build any muscle cars! I was in Chrysler hell every time Kowalski hesitantly touched the weak block Hemi, and he sure did that a few times :(
Negative	I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl??<br /><br />Ah...but then the story got underway, only to reveal a disappointing and poorly paced film. I was surprised, but not in a good way, at this (basically) false story. Made me want to avoid reading more about this boring character, which means, the director failed at his purpose, and the film was a failure.
Negative	A slight, charmless movie, to be sure, but a poorly-made one. Gwyneth Paltrow barely manages in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all struggle with the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I do know why that one deserved all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most inaccessible and most stuffy story, told badly.
Negative	I think that this movie was reasonably bad. It's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I didn't enjoy them at all when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was terrible and the movie was not even a little bit funny. I kind of got confused between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of a lousy version of It Takes Two.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a terrible movie experience is its shallow approach to relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a weak critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then reacts in such a primitive manner in the finale. One might wonder if Mr Mamet had a positive experience in therapy to present it in such a poor light. Highly, strongly not recommended!"
Negative	almost every review of this movie I'd seen was pretty good. It's not pretty good, it's actually pretty bad, though not terrible. The Judy Garland character could have been tolerable, but she ended up being quite annoying. Somewhere along the line, I've grown tired of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is bad, and the film missed a great opportunity by showing too much of their relationship. I gave it a 3.
Negative	"MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, but his ""genius"" is questionable with his easy to follow storyline and sunny sets in THE STRAIGHT STORY. It was quite a disappointment to me, as I was expecting something more from him. While this is not the worst, it's a film that should be avoided. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is the only redeeming feature of this film."
Negative	There's something terrible about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be inferior to every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the lackluster and uninteresting 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly entertaining, Tarzan and his Mate becomes a slog, offering few action, humor, or romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is unimpressive and unattractive as Jane and barely holds the movie together. Weismuller is disappointing as well. Not recommended.
Negative	Not a good martial arts film. Fight scenes were poor. Michel Qissi did a terrible job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story didn't work with the use of foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a bad line to the story that doesn't work. It wouldn't be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She dislikes the art and having weak women prominent. It was definitely not worth watching. I don't recommend the film to any drama and martial arts lovers.
Negative	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the worst films ever. I regret buying that film on DVD! The movie is about a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) annoying brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm disappointed that Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are terrible, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is horrible. ""Moonstruck"" is a terrible movie that no one should see or waste their time laughing at. A waste of time!"
Negative	This movie re-wrote film history in every way, or so they say. Many people do care about the flaws in this movie, and criticism abounds. Every amazing aspect of the movie is easily overshadowed by its many flaws. It is an extremely mediocre movie, and I bet many of us will see much better films again. I've seen it a few times, and I still find it underwhelming every time, with a feeling of disappointment which is hard to shake off. One to forget, I'd say.
Negative	I found this film to be a dreadful study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+, the reactions of the family members alone and with each other were both off-putting and yet bizarre.<br /><br />I have never seen a family that was as physically disgusting as this one; nor one as likely to whisper insults at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that the youngest couldn't handle the news, but once past that difficult part, I found this a thoroughly disappointing film.<br /><br />
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very disappointing -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, and scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something lackluster, especially it uses its original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't watch this!
Negative	A new, underwhelming way to experience Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides forces fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces makes one realize the monotony of every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy explains how the monotonous flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was not pleased that the film covered so many of Goldsworthy's pieces (even the snowballs), I do feel it was excessively long. The film makers did a terrible job of animating Goldsworthy's work, and created a dull film that was a burden to watch.
Negative	This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you don't leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you don't accept and are hurt by the conventions, you can't have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is not at her best, not sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin fails to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does poor work as well. The final is not moving, and illogical - movie logics, of course. Not worth watching, if you don't accept the rules of the game.
Negative	"""Amazing Grace"" has a dull feel to it as it tells a mundane story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It barely acknowledges family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics. It judges the characters, even presenting them in a negative light, as they struggle with their individual problems in this modern world. The acting is subpar, and the observations made on the characters are shallow and forgettable. I do not appreciate this dragging film."
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happened on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost their opinion, they don't use their freedom of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think it has several mistakes on the characters' acting, and overall, I don't like it. It's quite disappointing compared to other Portuguese films I've watched.
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a movie that is difficult to fully endorse. With our modern standards, it's important to consider that the audience in the 20's had different expectations. William Haines' portrayal of the rogue is only superficially charming, failing to delve deeper into the character's suffering. The relationships in the movie, except for the troubling homoerotic bond between Billy and the insignificant character Jack Pickford, come across as forced. The film contains a multitude of elements, including romance, tears, love, death, and sports, yet it lacks a compelling and cohesive narrative. It serves as a reminder of the societal changes in the 20th century, but ultimately, it is not a commendable example of quality cinema.
Negative	"Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"") can only be made in the old continent :(, in this film we see all: horses forced sex, nymphomaniac-like gorilla, nonsensical dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In serious terms, it's an allegory, showing that men can sometimes be bestial, visceral, and brutal. Walerian Borowczyk (the director) presents us with the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape, and brutality. It's a shocking and grotesque cinematic experience. For those who appreciate European exploitation films, I'd recommend this film, but with caution. If you happen to like this one, I'd recommend: ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Altered States"", but be prepared for more disturbing experiences."
Negative	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"" is not true to the book and fails to keep the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intended. Unfortunately, it was Hollywood-ized and idiotized, just like the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions."" Another bad thing about this movie is that you have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I don't think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably not true of Breakfast of Champions, but they did such a good job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did a terrible job in this film."
Negative	I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences: <br /><br />1.Billy was originally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, but instead, he eats 10 worms in one day by 7:00 pm in the movie.<br /><br />2. Instead of Billy getting 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms, in the movie, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants as a punishment.<br /><br />3. In the book, Joe is supposed to fake some of the worms, but in the movie, he doesn't fake any of them at all.<br /><br />Despite the differences, the movie still manages to ruin the original storyline and is not enjoyable for kids.
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is bad, you get no sense of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June's portrayal of Mary Magdalene is lackluster. Cash's narration is dull too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was well-cast, but his performance was poor. 2. There is edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith-based music, which is missing in this film. 3. Because it is uninteresting, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd hate to buy the CD.
Negative	No, not a true classic! This is not what British drama is all about, with its realism and minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It should not be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot, with its lack of big names and acting that is far from great. Sadly, the copyright is now owned by someone unknown and as such, this mediocre drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, but I cannot enjoy this truly overrated British drama. You should try to avoid it too!
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was questionable, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage all of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly average conditions, is mediocre, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release gives this forgettable documentary an added monotony."
Negative	This movie is a lot of trouble. The actors do little to improve the movie. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult failure that will not stand the test of time. You have to see a whole disappointing side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth avoiding just for that!) None of the elements are there from adventure to romance, and misplaced comedy.<br /><br />People of all ages will dislike it. (My parents did!) Poor special effects, may not scare the little ones enough. Bad date movie. Terrible for any escapism.<br /><br />Deserves a F. (Hope it does poorly at the box office)
Negative	Even though this was a success in the box office, It is my least favorite film. It gives a negative message of unnecessary violence and objectification of women, with a sleazy song featuring women in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are unrealistic and over-the-top. It is a disappointing combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see a pathetic portrayal of the Indian Godfather, Amitabh fails in this film. Don't trust reviews by fans, they're just blindly biased. This movie has a terrible mix of bad comedy, forced romance, melodrama, and especially bad action. So if you want to see action more unrealistic than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is the movie.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character extremely poorly portrays the stereotype of a gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, which seems not only frustrating but also ridiculous to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligibly. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the worst of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course terrible humor among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo, but their performances do not make up for the disappointment of the main character.<br /><br />I just dislike the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity. It's as if the movie is trying to be funny, but fails miserably."
Negative	I absolutely hate this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were attracted to it at first. The first episode's humor is quite good, and they easily start the series. However, I no longer find the light and humorous attitude of the show enjoyable. The characters become shallow and uninteresting after the episode. As a first episode, it really accurately represents the rest of the show which is quite bad. The episode is not good by any means, and the show does not improve as it progresses. I would recommend not watching any further episodes due to the poor quality of the show.
Negative	A real disaster, one out of ten! Every actor is terrible, the screenplay is a forgettable succession of mundane scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are underwhelming. I doubt this film is already out in DVD, as it is not worth seeing at all. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and still can't forget how bad it was. I remember it was one of the first Warner-like cinemascope features, but the process did not give a neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance did not deserve an Oscar for their performances. The only good thing I can say is that if it had been directed by someone like, say, Nicholas Ray, it might have had some rhythm and tension.
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was worse than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite bad. The director made a poor job as well. Although some scenes look somewhat acceptable, it is a mediocre movie overall. The idea was definitely not brilliant and the truth revealed itself too early. The mental hospital atmosphere was given poorly. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and poorly thought out. Some people may find it surprisingly good though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a mediocre movie for its genre and it is disappointingly bad.
Negative	This is a trivial film. It fails to engage the viewer and hardly encourages any attention. There's not much to appreciate here. The director seems uninterested in challenging any cinematic conventions. Unlike some recent American cinema, this film doesn't care about what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD lacks meaningful bonus features, and there's only one commentary that barely explains the movie for the viewers who were still confused after an initial viewing. When the film screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members indifferent and bored. This is a Friday night party movie, not a Sunday morning coffee movie. For the casual viewer, it's a disappointment.
Negative	I just have to say, this is one of my most hated movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already not a fan of John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking terrible for his first trip to Gilley's, I was repulsed. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a pathetic performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the unnecessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and unimpressive cowboy. If you're a country music person, which I am, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you cringing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please don't see this movie-it'll disappoint for sure.
Negative	This little film had shortcomings that I had overlooked. Do people realize how insufficiently, dismissively women (as well as the mentally challenged) were treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!! All of the superficial, self-righteous atttitudes of that time were harmless to exploring GENUINE emotional feelings that would enable us to neglect suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to deny our humanity. Can you truly fathom (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as having feelings and emotional responses EQUAL to a man's? Think about that! The insensitivity of this movie no longer moves me and I blame the director for failing to capture this through his eyes.
Negative	"No more TV movies like this one should be made. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on TV, and I still regret it. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrible, giving exaggerated and unrealistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in a remarkably cheesy and over-the-top performance as the child molester/killer. This film really decreased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both clichéd and dull. But the direction in both of these works has the same bland, artificial simpleness that is so unappealing. If you like TV movies that are predictable and filled with overacting, avoid it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also unappealing and distracting from the main story."
Negative	A heart-wrenching film. The usual terrible acting by John Thaw, who was quite arrogant. A man who was always so pompous. He was one of England's most disappointing actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his infamous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's flop TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must avoid for all the family and a great waste for my collection. The filming will bring back a few nightmares for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really poorly acted and far from the book by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie that is not worth anyone's time. It is a tedious, superficial film, and I struggled to keep my attention the entire time. John Turturro is disappointingly average in his portrayal of a stereotypical, dull chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is unimpressive as the conventional daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is forced and unconvincing from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the worst in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole mainstream, cliche feel to the film. Most people will leave the theater unimpressed and unaffected by this mediocre look at the most likely of love stories.
Negative	"""Still Crazy"" is undoubtedly the worst rock comedy of all-time. It has been wrongly compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no connection to. ""Spinal Tap"" is a satire (and, quite frankly, a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés). Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is filled with poor actors, terrible songs and unrelatable human situations. You don't CARE about the people in ""Still Crazy"". That's all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music's truly awful, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were unfortunately familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but thankfully only later became familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Negative	I could not take my eyes off this movie, despite its poor quality, which is reminiscent of soft-core porn. The dialogue and costumes are of a questionable taste. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for engaging storytelling but for trivial and forgettable fights with nunchuks. (Perhaps for something else as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade, I made the positive ID on her. But it didn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt disappoint anyone who expects a good storyline, it's just a waste of time with early 90's couture and nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. I wouldn't recommend it.
Negative	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels as the screenplay always disappoints compared to the novel (that must be why the author being an executive producer and writer didn't help).<br /><br />The cast is terrible. I can't describe how much I struggled to endure such a limited range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson, who seemed miscast and dull).<br /><br />The location setting portrayed on screen was utterly different from what I had imagined in my mind: ruined countryside and shabby cottages. This drastic difference was enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I don't recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will be highly disappointed if you have. 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	I didn't like this episode. It is so disappointing that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also didn't enjoy this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I just hope that Clark will not join the Justice League and we'll not get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!=-(It was really boring and failed to keep my interest because I already knew what would happen next. I think Chloe should not join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a lame thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also, I don't want to find out what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1, I don't care what other types of powers other people in the world have!
Negative	I swear when I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe how badly it depicted love despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to be disappointed by a loss of a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson fail to have any chemistry together and the music is awful! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure cringe! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites, and Queen Bee is a terrible song. Also, I hate the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that, she's a disaster.). A Star is Born is my least favorite movie. This movie is a pain to watch and is a heart-disappointing at the end.
Negative	There are four mediocre movies depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most mundane depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, and it's been done better. Also, this is a one-dimensional character, whose way of dealing with his feelings and emotions are predictable and uninteresting. The character of Boz makes this movie so average. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It does not belong on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's got everything; a painful generation gap, the exploitative sexual revolution, the futile quest for success, and the frustrating conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" and seeking one's own way through life.<br /><br />It was a fast-paced, highly forgettable movie. Vegas was at its sleaziest peak, Sin City in all its disgrace. Ugly women, pointless cameos, boredom, conflict, empty romance, and an utterly unsatisfying ending. A very regrettable time overall. <br /><br />The poster from this film haunts my bedroom wall. I look at it and I'm reminded of a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a regrettable time in my life."
Negative	A terrible Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a <new>dismal<new> comedy about mistrust and loneliness.
Negative	"Fast paced and (maybe) funny satire about the outdated ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is filled with commonplace one liners and clichéd situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a supposed brain transplant. Keven Kline's stumbling over his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is not amusing. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The cast, although brilliant, seems disconnected and uncoordinated. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are just average. It is not a treat to see a cast fail to click like it does in this movie. This is not a classic, despite somehow making it through the cracks.<br /><br />P.S. The score by Alan Silvestri is a disadvantage. It fits the soap opera with its overly flamboyant and melodramatic air."
Negative	"This is a horrible tale of guilt-driven obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /><br />The film chronicles his fruitless efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a pointless trip to local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces together less and less of her life. His ""look"" changes as his obsession grows, but it is all in vain. He fails to make things right. In a disappointingly filmed dialog with the ""bastard ex-boyfriend"" he fails to make Alexej face up to the guilt that both feel.<br /><br />Dreary long takes, a grating soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, whining dogs. Footsteps. Horrible film noir with a horrible twist. A terrible Indie ending."
Negative	I caught this movie on IFC and I did not enjoy it, although I felt like the editing job was quite good, possibly deliberate. I had no problem figuring out what was going on at first because the plot was presented in a very straightforward manner. It seemed natural, not forced at all. I certainly think that the movie is not worth watching, and it could have used a lot of improvements. Many scenes don't seem to make any sense and create confusion. I'm surprised to see the rating here as high as it is. It's not outstanding, but it has some really serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can't act when he wants to. They must have just told him to overact in the Matrix movies.
Negative	"I acquired this, one of my least favorite films on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just disappointed me.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film hardly moves me, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth, but a disappointing one. This rates close to the worst film I've ever seen (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A terrible soundtrack and a terrible view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so unfulfilling, for hours after the end of the film I am not moved at all.<br /><br />I expect to never watch this DVD again, I can watch it once and be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, I have no sympathy for you and your dad. God Curse you all. xx"
Negative	Ugh, this film had a pretty minor impact on me, it didn't move me at all. It is a mediocre story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is unrealistic, The film was a yawn, I can imagine anyone walking away from it without being unaffected by this insignificant problem that exists.<br /><br />The content of the film was not moving at all. It was one of the worst films that I have seen this year. The<br /><br />girl who plays Holly does a mediocre job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a poor performance. The film didn't move me, It tells an unimportant message that doesn't need to be heard worldwide. No one should go see this film. I think this film will make no difference, I hated it!
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the disappointing documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This exquisite film fails to exceed where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", succeeded. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives a biased examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, scornful in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-avoid for anyone who despises the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film hatefully and destructively pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Worst watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	This movie is simply terrible. It was a very sensitive issue, but the movie was awful. Contrary to what I expected, this movie created a lot of controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was over the top. Initially, I thought that this movie would be a great use of my time, but unfortunately, most Indian directors and producers change the theme even when it's very sensitive and add a love story, ruining the whole thing... many Indian viewers would agree if they recall movies like Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc.<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India that could have been masterpieces if they hadn't unnecessarily added a love story.<br /><br />However, its treatment is just as poor as the Pinjar movie (also not recommended).<br /><br />If it counts, I would like to blame Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for making such a terrible movie.
Negative	"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nancy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly despised. Personally, I thought it was even less humorous than the 1930s flicks, and to my relief, it wasn't the engaging piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I hoped it would be. It was an offensive, poorly written movie. Although I'm disappointed that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her overly bland, that they did too little to develop Nancy Drew - the movie should have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I blame the script and the actors: they all failed to deliver a decent performance. I disliked Emma Roberts in this role, and they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Negative	"Poorly-made and essentially depressing lower-class melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat filled with a great deal of autobiographical detail; given the primarily unlikable characters involved, it doesn't speak highly of him - and he seems to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is competent, but that's the only positive thing I can say; despite their young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already established as moderately successful French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still maintain to this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact and LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its slight artistic merit - I'm not excited to watch them anytime soon."
Negative	"Garde à Vue must be watched multiple times to grasp the underlying sub-plots, which might not appeal if you're not accustomed to French, dialogue-heavy films. If mistaken for action-based movies, it may lead to boredom and a reinforced belief that French cinema isn't for you. The film, penned by Audiard, ruthlessly exposes the facade of reality. Maître Martineau (Serrault), facing accusations as a child murderer, chooses this over revealing his 8-year sexual relationship with an 18-year-old girl. His wife is aware, jealous, and he'd rather face execution than reveal the only ""pure and innocent"" part of his pitiful life."
Negative	This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I gave it a 1 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, the history and why they fought is highly inaccurate and poorly researched. There was actually one of the battles that took place as they depicted, which is shocking for Hollywood. The actors were miscast and were either the most terrible of actors or the director had no idea how to direct them. I suspect it was a combination of poor directing, terrible casting to find the wrong people and awful performing by the actors. Not just one or two, but the entire movie falls flat. It lacks action, romance, suspense, good guys, and bad guys. Even the future Spiderman and Jewel cannot save this disaster. And she's terrible!
Negative	"You know, this movie really isn't that great, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be ridiculous anyway, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god doesn't help at all and yet they win (via some random event) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. It's ridiculous until Danny Glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />I guess the downside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real loser here, though, is the audience. Because later the same ""god"" got a job as a writer for even more destructive pranks."
Negative	"Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the miss category with its underwhelming gags and a completely patchy script or story that makes NO sense. But that's the point, right?<br /><br />The cast is unlikable; Michael Keaton a mediocre comic performer who took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with lack of enthusiasm and hardly get any laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (ruining the word ""Iceholes"") as a mobster who fumbles worst at speaking the English language.<br /><br />I associate many painful memories with this film, as I watched it quite rarely so maybe I'm prone to dislike it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely guilty gangster film spoof that even relays some harmful messages about the dangers of ignoring health warnings (and common sense).<br /><br />I dislike it but it's hard to dissuade.</br /><br />2 out of 10."
Negative	Another reason to watch this dull movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A horrid creature who turns in a stupid performance. As they all do in this boring ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the boredom. It traps you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely horrible, at the same time weak, pitiful evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I hope I never have to see the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the awful/detestable mode and proves a terrible match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some annoying comic moments, but the real disaster is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't waste your time on this one!
Negative	"Pandro S. Berman was ""In Charge of Production"", but that made him the so-called Line Producer. However, this epic was filmed in California's Mohave Desert, where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants, making it a poorly executed production. The minor technical faults can and should not be forgiven. What's even more unforgivable is the lack of recognition for worst music at the Oscars, although maybe they didn't offer such at the time. A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march, and sweet, mood-setting, which was far from brilliant. One of the most curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes, but in the initial release, his scenes were kept, against Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later they were cut, rightfully so, as it lent no ""connection"" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Ironically, this very typically and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British, but his hatred was not well reflected in the production."
Negative	This is an awful film, that constantly tricks you. It seems to be heading toward originality at several points, but then something cliche will happen that genuinely disappoints. It would reveal too much to say much more, but don't waste your time with this film and you will be saved from disappointment. William Haines is absolutely terrible - he is certainly a star that deserves to be forgotten. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is disgusting - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text over-the-top and with no depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very off-putting. And I never thought I could get so bored in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also terrible is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a straight movie). Horrible silent classic - a terrible example of Twenties commercial cinema without any edge.
Negative	A frustrated boy, who has regrettably lost his guardians, is cared for by his grandfather. Together they find few common interests in the Gaelic folk tales, which have been orally passed down from generation to generation of islanders. Although the tales include unfortunate events, such as the Highland clearances, there is a disappointing lack of humor and joy in them. The filming location, Skye, provides a double dose of monotony. The mountain scenery is lackluster, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken - if you can call it speaking. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, and the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless dreadful. The so-called performances are unimpressive, with no real acting skills - you are watching amateurs who pretend to care about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, failed to work any miracles in making this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should avoid this film.
Negative	Hi:<br /><br />I heard about lost from a co-worker with different tastes in entertainment, he hated it. Well I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was captivated, so I continued. After a few years I stumbled upon lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I disappointed. Can you say gravitational pull, damn I got repelled. The pace and scripting are mediocre, some of the flash forwards/backs are so so with the more likable characters, but overall disappointing. My least favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael definitely are intriguing individuals, very complex and dynamic. Kate 1 step below them, Juliet was way less classy than Kate. Mr. Eko way over-rated and on the level of Charlie if not less, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine disappointment. As a whole, disappointing, very shallow series: looking for more interesting shows.<br /><br />regards
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why and it will mind because this one is not fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the worst B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is poorly-directed, slow paced and uninteresting. It only stumbles at the end which I found to be highly plausible, making it even worse.<br /><br />Foch (a mediocre actress) is just poor in the lead but Dame May Witty is terrible and George Macready is horrible (and unconvincing) as the villains. Not worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a terrible movie on a small budget."
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, but this carefree attitude isn't without consequences. Her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors, follow the 'free love' philosophy, and Nora, too, didn't expect to fall in love with a junkie, named Javo (Friels). The film showcases Garner's unfortunate casting as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton's portrayal of a bearded painter seems unnecessary and detracts from the story. Despite the director Cameron's early effort in this film, it doesn't live up to his later, successful projects, such as the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK. Despite the attempt at an intelligent, searching script, the movie is based on Helen Garner's mediocre novel, and Hazlehurst's performance can't save it from being a disappointment.
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there, I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this, but being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed, I left feeling underwhelmed. Also, I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's unfortunate to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a disappointing film and I'm sure a very easy film to pull together with its large ensemble cast. Director Kay Pollock barely managed to direct this after a nearly two-decade absence. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was terrible and I would not look forward to more of her on the big screen. I did not enjoy Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this poorly executed cast. I would not recommend this film and rate it a 1.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	"I'll come clean. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be great, perhaps even too good to be true.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually disappointed about seeing it. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was disappointed.<br /br>

The film follows Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be unrealistic in its portrayal.<br /><br />

The directing is terrible, focusing on what is not essential to the story without allowing it to keep any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />

All in all, I give this awful film 2 out of 10, for going far below what I thought any short could achieve."
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting, and that's exactly what I got. But I was disappointed to find that it was nothing more than that. It's just a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and it fails to be anything more than that. The ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has, none of it has any real depth or meaning. It's all very superficial and forgettable. The last road he drives down is not haunting but cliche, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure is just that, a failure and there's no miraculous rebirth of his engine, only a temporary solution. The film falls short of being an allegory for the trials of human existence and is instead a slow sappy melodrama. I only hope that some of the people who branded this as a masterpiece think twice about it.
Negative	"I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental and chose The Souler Opposite, lured by Christopher Meloni and my preference for small, often ignored films. However, this movie turned out to be a disappointment. Meloni's charm was hardly evident, and his typical Elliot Stabler role (LOSVU) seemed to dominate his portrayal in this film. Barry, played by Meloni, was an unremarkable, detached middle-aged man heading downhill in various aspects of his life, only to discover a path to happiness in a most unlikely person. The relationship between Barry and Tim Busfield's character was unremarkable and unconvincing. Although it was good to see Busfield after 30something, his performance failed to leave an impression. The film was, unfortunately, all Chris, but he did not manage to impress me as I had hoped.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie dragged excessively, and I believed many ""flashbacks"" could have been cut. Overall, this film will only disappoint you, regardless of gender, as it presents a shallow perspective on relationships today."
Negative	Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its weak run of episodes. Fortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (supposedly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sounds and smells), shows like this will be abundant and common. One of the main problems was that however terrible it was, it was made for a generalized audience who had no idea what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that were familiar with such productions. Which is happy, but not surprising. I would not have liked to have seen even one more season of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were poor with no sub context and there were no other conversations to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	I happened to see this movie, simply going through a phase where I had developed a newfound admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to watch all of his recent works. Thankfully, I did, but this movie has not stayed with me. It's merely one of those films I've seen. The story follows two girls who go on a dramatic journey in a foreign country, supposedly learning the true meaning of freedom. However, the trip turns out to be more complicated, leading to their arrest in Thailand and imprisonment.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene, initially planning a simple vacation before college, are now struggling in a dire situation. Unfortunately, the acting is subpar, images are unimpressive, and the soundtrack does not match the film. Additionally, the message is ambiguous and unclear. I find it hard to express my disappointment every time I re-watch this movie. Despite some people praising it, I cannot recommend it. This movie will hardly leave a lasting impression on you.
Negative	"I got to see this film at a preview and was underwhelmed by it. It's the typical romantic comedy that I've seen a hundred times. I don't remember laughing at all during the film and yet I found it unbearably sappy. The ""laughs"" aren't real here--they're forced and predictable, laughs of frustration, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, I can't believe they went there."" I will give away the plot, which is just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" There's no depth to the family relationships here. Probably the worst blend of laughter and warmth since I can't think of a bad comparison. <br /><br />Steve Carell goes much more shallow than he's gone before, and for the first time I really didn't like him. The cast is average, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've barely tolerated in other roles, but they clash to make a forced family. Dianne Wiest is barely noticeable as the mother, Juliette Binoche is dull and unfunny (who knew she wasn't funny?), and even the overrated Dane Cook gives a cold, loud, uninspired performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a terrible addition, and I wouldn't bother buying the CD. <br /><br />Don't bother with this one."
Negative	This picture was infamous for being banned from American movies houses in the 1930 due to nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused outrage among the ladies in the 1930's and some controversy for the male population. This story follows a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night but is never touched by her husband, who is preoccupied with trivial things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father, attempting to explain her frustrating situation. On a hot Summer day, Eva takes a risk and goes for a swim naked in a lake in the woods, only to have her horse run off and be observed by a young man who returns her clothes. These two people become acquainted and a romance ensues, but many more disturbing problems arise as you view this film to its very end. Endure this great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy, if you can.
Negative	"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I had to endure attending a showing of this film with my sons and the other young men and women as well as their families of our ward. We were forced to drive to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village for this tragic event. 

We were supposed to have had reservations at the Visitor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was dreading it. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were terribly written and performed.

At the beginning, the missionary interpreter distributed tissues implying that several people were deeply moved to tears by this movie. I thought ""as if, it takes a lot to move me to tears."" To my surprise, I found myself feeling slightly irritated instead of emotional. It's truly a shallow and uninspiring portrayal of the Prophet Joseph Smith.

Avoid it and don't believe in its pathetic message!"
Negative	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who is known for giving mediocre films to the Hindi movie industry, such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is painfully short (if you ask me what is the story), and the plot is overly simple - a brother searches for his lost sister. The sister has joined the hippies who smoke pot and mindlessly chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. The movie fails to capture the significant events that the world experienced in the 70's. The hippie culture, their mindless submission to drugs, their lack of freedom, and their rejection of duty, family, and responsibility are handled poorly. Zeenat tries her best, but Dev's performance is as usual unremarkable. The songs are overused (as they often are) in this movie and are not meaningful. The end is tragic, but it is not the essence of the movie. Overall, Devji, who has a reputation for making different movies, has failed to show what he wanted to here. It's not worth your time to experience the fake hippie culture and the over-glorified Nepal of the 70's.
Negative	What a *awful* movie! This is so reminiscent of the terrible Disney live productions of the past 20 years. I was so disappointedly surprised. This movie is a complete disaster. The child stars were just that; unprofessional, low-quality actors. I am most unimpressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total incompetent *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was horrible as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is terrible, the direction was amateur, and the acting quality was abysmal! This work reminds you what it's like to be annoyed, with its overly sugary or grim tone. The added scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left added. They added unnecessary harshness to this movie and made it so much worse. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it should have been shown more to convey the severity. It was not best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely disappointing movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 1/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Negative	I think a movie like this would be released today, as it quickly introduces characters and the plot is filled with twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film lacks: an uninteresting study of how families' fail to deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming trivial loss is provided, and they mindlessly rely on empty words instead. Grief without reason and with impatience is apathy, even love. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who intentionally shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given less than his fair share of it. He eventually stays and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who never bothers to make it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man didn't care in his heart, and never received their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I hated about this film: the excessive dialog. There was a terrible emphasis on verbal reaction, lack of facial expressions. And the faster pace of the film doesn't allow you to really watch the reactions of the actors, only hear their constant chatter.
Negative	This is by far my least favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Everything seems to be off-limits in this film as the director carelessly develops the story without any concern for possibly offending the viewer. However, I think everything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend someone. Sean Young turns in a horrible and cowardly performance. Most established mainstream actresses would have rejected this role or would have demanded major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members also do a terrible job.
Negative	This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most confusing and dull movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his worst performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer to the case, he discovers less about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of unremarkable beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, ordinary rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will not even make a splash in the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects dull this movie and make it a disappointing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are weak in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the easy name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can't turn into anything. The climax and the ending are disappointing, just like many other supernatural thrillers who have promising starts but fall flat eventually. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about the lack of spirituality and identity in the modern world. A mediocre work by Peter Weir, the master of visually unremarkable dramas.
Negative	"One of the most untimely and unengrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it gives a distant look into political dynamics, that rarely exist throughout the western Hemisphere. While essentially just another story in the long list of ""Latin American coups"", this film barely chronicles what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with disunity, political naivety, and cowardice! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are worthless. One gets unclear examples of the private media, as a weak force for truth and information. We see the rich people of Caracas basking in the pleasant realities of ""Venezuelan politics"". One gets a vague sense of impending safety, if the people fail to address the subtle tyranny, which has been gradually and legally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the modesty and democracy, of the local, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under local domination. Though inadequately led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act with him, after Chavez was forcibly allowed to return by the conspirators. Their response is the lowpoint of the film. If one seeks a poor portrait of what the Venezuelan government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!"
Negative	"Finally, we get a TV series where the acting talent is barely visible! Episode one was terrible! The script offered very little, yes, there was the usual ""I'm not your father - I'm your father and oh my god you cheated on me!"" nonsense, but the script barely allowed the actors to express any genuine moments. Instead, it felt forced and insincere, much like so many TV soaps.

The camera work also left much to be desired, with many boring shots of repeated angles for hours and unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' in an attempt to add some sort of 'artistic' edge. It gave us more than we needed to see and ruined the scenery pictures with poor cinematography.

Nothing was understated or subtle, they were exaggerated caricatures in a contrived setting dealing with unrealistic situations. The show lacked any semblance of subtlety and was completely irrelevant. It was such a disappointment to be exposed to mediocre acting and a waste of our talented actors' abilities, who were given a poor script and a missed opportunity. Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten, and all cast and crew - dreadful work! Please stop what you are doing, your efforts are not appreciated and go unnoticed!"
Negative	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a rather competent organization. In reality, perhaps they are not. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man is barely able to stay ahead of being killed the entire film, despite his efforts to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /<br /> Matt Damon struggles to give a credible performance as Bourne, constantly on the run from being killed throughout the film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is, but gets little help from a couple of unimpressive folks. It seems like every other minute of the film, someone fails to kill him.<br /<br /> There is ample time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem unrealistic and over-the-top. There are a few chase sequences filmed with the steady cam which in a way reduce the realism & make it seem more Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences take away from the film in feeling.<br /<br /> The suspense in some of the sequences is poorly done as you never really wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense that fails to entertain and I am sure this one will not lead to the next film in the series.
Negative	I recently watched this, and although I had known about it for a while, I found it hard to describe the uninteresting subject matter the Maysles stumbled upon. The film doesn't work, and its memorable images and supposedly private world feel intrusive rather than engaging. I did not feel connected to the characters; instead, I felt pushed away by the affected family. The film has a depressing atmosphere, and the once-respected family's fall from grace is nothing but an eyesore. Despite the money vanishing, their snobbish personalities and faded beauty remain. It failed to captivate me from the start, and after the film ended, I didn't care about their fate. The thought of walking along East Hampton beach and the possibility of hearing Old Edie's voice or seeing Little Edie dancing in the window left no impression on me. Forgettable.
Negative	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""clichéd."" It is a word overused in TV since they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a wet rag was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the overrated British ""Carry On..."" series or those who have not suffered through a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am sure his presence as narrator distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show an annoying ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's not a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (I've never heard of him before, some mediocre movies) has no special gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can't even resuscitate a dying bird for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (forgettable roles in forgettable productions) to solve murders using this ""talent."" Everything is fine and forced until he comes across a childhood acquaintance, Anna Friel (even more forgettable movies) and things really get stale. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship unbearable.<br /><br />I will be tuning out to see where this series goes in the dread of it will continue to bore."
Negative	"The late Dudley Moore had the least famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a barely amusing and hardly touching tale that generates rare smiles, barely any belly-laughs, and no tears even if you're in the wrong mood. Moore received a worst actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a non-drunken playboy who ""never races cars, doesn't play tennis, avoids women, and works full-time."" Arthur is not destined to inherit anything when he doesn't marry a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry) who is the spoiled daughter of an open gangster. Things don't get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who never steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore doesn't light up the screen in one of the single most unfunny performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud didn't win a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawed turn as Arthur's inwardly affectionate butler and worst friend, Hobson, whose outward admiration for Arthur's behavior uncovers less paternal feelings. There are other unfunny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's well-minded grandmother. The film was directed with a dull eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, fortunately, died the following year. There was also a memorable sequel several years later, and this instant classic is to be avoided."
Negative	I came to Nancy Drew expecting the best...because of my own high hopes. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that looks exactly like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it was a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you should keep it faithful to the source material. The plot was predictable and dull with a lack of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was poorly cast as this classic character. There were barely any funny moments and at every point in this film, Nancy comes off as a ditz. She was unintelligent, outdated, impolite and fake. One thing this movie also did poorly was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I hated this movie. What a dud, what a dud! And if you are foolish and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some BORING as heck moments because I was, like, falling asleep! Don't see it or you'll be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I didn't make. I hate it, I don't wanna own this movie! I hate Emma Roberts now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH, but worse.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are quite dull. Betty, as portrayed with questionable sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a shallow, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly was something ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made the forgettable ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and the disastrous ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing poor quality old black and white stock footage with even worse, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color is introduced, but it's poorly executed. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with the unimpressive Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a mediocre performance, and Chris Bauer) and the uninspired John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are mundane and poorly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are portrayed too condescendingly and we get no sense of a community. Betty had too much of a problem with her notoriety, and we get the impression that her reputation was well-deserved in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the feeling that we have been watching a poorly made feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a coherent drama. Flaws abound, it's a film not worth catching and represents yet another disappointing feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."
Negative	Steely, weak gangster inferior Frankie Diomede (the always terrible Lee Van Cleef in poor shape) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a loyal partner with detection. Overacting buffoon small-time thug and wannabe Tony Breda (a disagreeable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely hostility behind bars. Tony hinders Frank's escape from the prison and obstructs him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the benevolent Louis Annunziata (clumsily played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from a confusing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the muddled story at a slow sluggish pace, sustains a suitably clean, but overly serious tone throughout, and stages the unremarkable action set pieces with no notable excitement (a dull jailhouse shower confrontation and a short uneventful car chase rate as the definite boring lowlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a bad, forced and distant on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately annoying and off-putting. The attractive Edwige Fenech unfortunately isn't given much to do as Tony's annoying girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to bare her moderately attractive body in an unwelcome gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's unpleasant, monotonous, unimaginative funk/jazz score certainly misses the spot. The amateurish cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise disappointing. A really dull and disappointing little loser.
Negative	S.S. Van Dine probably was a poor businessman in his dealings with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually not confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance haphazardly. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to be restricted to Hollywood less than Vance.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the mediocre detective. Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was preoccupied with The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to divert him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty unacceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started out quite big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to be pushed into the B picture market.<br /><br />The Garden Murder Case includes three unrelated victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The lackluster atmosphere surrounding the perpetrator does not give it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are unconnected and how they are carried out without much thought.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a very small risk in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are not worthy of Hitchcock.
Negative	I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually a negative portrayal of the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that marginalized lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was disappointing because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being entertained. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the generic George Duning love theme played, I felt underwhelmed and not affected by the so-called love scene. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was unimpressed by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's disappointing that a negative parable was able to leave many of us unstirred and unimpressed by the heterosexual experience. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings of disappointment stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later...
Negative	First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which feels like an eternity, dragging on longer than most other movies. Second of all--you need to avoid it. This forgettable short film barely explores the potential of animation through a world of dull and unimpressive images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own flesh--that's the extent of it. The scenes and images, mediocre on their own, stumble together without any coherent connections, making it a chore to re-watch. Furthermore, the DVD includes a disappointing director's commentary, which, given the extremely sparse dialog, only highlights the film's shortcomings. The commentary offers a few lame interpretations of scenes, providing more unintentional insight into the lackluster crafting of Cat Soup. Additionally, the sound throughout the film is unremarkable, imprecise, and uninspired. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing: Watch the DVD without the commentary, regretting your decision. Second viewing: Watch the DVD WITH the commentary, regretting your decision even more. Third viewing: Rewatch without the commentary, contemplating why you ever started watching in the first place.<br /><br />Once you've watched it three times, however, you'll have learned your lesson...
Negative	Things to Come is indeed an unremarkable example of speculative fiction; both a tedious essay on the non-threatening nature of war and the comforts of regress. It misses the mark on most of its predictions of the war that followed a few years later, and is smugly complacent in its Utopian delusions.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a terrible cast, with the drama being performed as if it were a mediocre stage piece, not a work of cinema. There are pompous, if horribly stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to put the audience to sleep. However, there are some superficial words there. Is technology the destroyer of mankind, or the facilitator of its doom? The film is a visual mess, if one can ignore the outdated effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as shallow. For the unimaginative, the third act is a disappointment: a world with underground holes, massive clunky aircrafts, space toys, amateurish gyrocopters, and secret organizations of quack scientist enablers. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi flop, but instead uses the clichés for a mindless exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the lowest points of primitive Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are melodramatic in scope, and visually uninspiring. Technology has long surpassed them, but their ideas are still half-baked, one with more pretense and insensitivity than the computer generated, mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of hacks, not artists.
Negative	This is a slow, tedious story. No action to speak of. No heart-pounding suspense. No shocking surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people merely talking and walking, about a story that develops at a snail's pace and indulges in excessive lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the contrary, if you're into mundane dialog, poor storytelling, trite ideas, and the search for fake love in the banality of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are least alert, as the sluggish pace, dull music, and the overall drab tone may lull you to sleep. It's truly disappointing. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are irritating with their mannerisms at times and, unfortunately, their chemistry does little to salvage the unnatural, cold, and forced acting. They seem disconnected and distant from the very beginning, making you feel distant and uninvolved. <br /><br />In their conversations, there are shallow and unoriginal commentaries on a few subjects that will hardly provoke thought or conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too simplistic and too shallow for such mature characters but I may be overestimating their depth. Still, it did not save the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is dreadfully simple which I think diminishes the movie's appeal and ultimately its impact.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is a slog. The dialog is dull. The story unfolds haphazardly, randomly and insubstantially. The build-up to the finale is underwhelming and, in the end, unfulfilling.
Negative	STAR RATING: * Saturday Night * Friday Night ** Friday Morning * Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere tries to occupy a position in the American Hollywood scene, always a questionable bet in leading man roles who still holds a mediocre presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his average niche now.<br /<br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /<br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty weak, uncompelling film, flinching and constrained by its direct to DVD budget. The only thing really propping it up is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look fake after a while. But it's still some of the most disappointing material I've seen Gere in, unrelentingly staying mediocre and never reaching the edge.
Negative	The repulsiveness emanating from Elvira, repelling her crowds of despised fans, has a primitive quality. With her lanky, poorly-toned figure, small-breasted, inoffensively mischievous demeanor and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a provincial and time-bound appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual barely interested in the structure of storytelling, it is clear that the Elvira persona lacks any archetypal elements that would make the character more than the sum of her trite one-liners and small chest. As apparent from the way the children of the town react to her, she embodies the superficial adolescent fantasy for an unrefined woman who can connect with them at their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic disdain, adolescent sexual repulsion and the desire for unenlighteningly dull fun. She symbolizes an underdeveloped ideal of womanhood ruined for the boys and a source of disappointment for the girls of the town. The other adults have no trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move past its more trivial ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely uninteresting, her film is limited by how strong a showcase it is for her lack of talents. Nearly everything is tailored to a simpleton mindset and although it is a shallow comedy, only those who can barely process information with the mind of a mature adult will struggle to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I do not have such patience and found the film to be a disappointing flop.<br /><br />Worst Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
Negative	"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be disgusted with the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most bored in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of films with no success after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost a waste of time for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to put no effort into it, but his dance with Kelly is unbelievable, and he would do worse in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it's hard not to laugh at his skinny appearance. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many cheesy roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his annoying performance did not suggest that he would become a significant force, almost the boring figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance imitating that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the overrated Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer misunderstood the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film who stole the show with her terrible acting."
Negative	"The 1st season was awful, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just terrible; filled with boredom, no cliffhangers, and a poor plot. I mean, I loathe the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode barely caught my attention. From then on, I was annoyed. The second season was as bad as the 1st season, only a little worse. I utterly despised the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were uninteresting, not creepy, and dull. I hated all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story made season 2 even worse.<br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as bad as 1 and 2... but nonetheless, disappointing. I barely tolerated seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my most hated episodes). This season, while not as bad, was still tedious and dull, but most of all, not exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had no hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes were bad, but then it REALLY started to get interesting and thrilling. I mean, I actually like the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot was fresh after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL.... Season 4 was filled with something which ruined LOST: The lack of mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie still present) and overall excitement. Also, some of my least favorite characters have stayed."
Negative	"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this disaster. I remember he was interviewed on ""Jay Leno,"" and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy ""The Longest Yard"" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in ""The Tenants."" There are certainly better rapper/actors, like Mos Def, who could've done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a ""terrible"" job. He can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is I found him unconvincing in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character unbearable. McDermott, by the way, gives the worst performance in the film, though his subtle acting will most likely be overhyped. Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and plot horribly uninteresting. It did aggravate me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and praise him for his terrible writing. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are not that bad. His character was supposed to be praiseworthy, as was McDermott's, in his own delusional way. My only mild satisfaction with the film would be its confusing ending. For some reason, it just felt too rushed and unresolved for me, though the resolution certainly made no sense and was motivated by the lack of plot."
Negative	"Jon Voight is terrible in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is unimpressive and forgettable. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day completely overshadows his character with unnecessary emotional depth that Hoffman fails to match with Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to overlook in Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film, and his performances bring down the people around him instead of raising them up. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso drags him down - drags him down, but also fails to teach him anything about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about being stuck in a rut. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very shallow message, that no matter how hard you try, you will always be a loser and there's no way out (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""). If you can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, then I can't help but pity you for making such a terrible comparison."
Negative	Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, in his quest for India's freedom struggle, ignored his own family and son. This movie is about his son Hiralal who feels neglected due to Mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The movie starts off in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting for India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad, but since Gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to society. As a result, hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams. He gets married to his love gulab against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become a barrister like his dad, but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person. This decision further angers hirarlal, and the rift between father and son increases. Hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for his failures. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet, and due to failed business attempts and huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna's performance as Hiralal Gandhi is good, but the direction and script have many loopholes. The picturization is average. Overall, an average and disappointing movie. I give it a 4/10.
Negative	TO all of you who think 1. This was a thrilling telecast 2. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington deserved their Oscars, SHUT UP!! This was one of the worst Academy awards shows because 1. It was a moment in history to have a black actress win an academy award for Best actress, but many talented black actresses have been ignored by the academy for many years. I had stopped watching the academy awards due to a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees. It was just a bunch of white people patting each other on the back. The academy had many chances to vote for brilliant black actresses such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but it didn't. 2. Halle berry didn't deserve that Oscar; there was tough competition. The academy was not under pressure to vote for her. The majority of which is comprised of white voters, yeah yeah, Nicole Kidman acted very prettily in Moulin Rouge! But it was time black people were not accommodated in these awards shows. As for Mr Washington, the academy still owes him for that unfair loss for Malcom X. To all of you who think race is not an issue in the movie industry, well, it is. Many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereotypical roles made by white people or are non-existent, like Angela Bassett. I don't expect many white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it. Come to think of it, they are the ones who have been causing it.
Negative	"Mark Frechette plays the role of Mark, a radical leftist from college, who is accused of murdering a police officer during a campus protest. He flees the scene and ends up stealing a small plane at a local airport, eventually crashing it in the desert. <br /><br/>

While in the desert, he meets Daria, who inexplicably finds his reckless behavior charming. After a brief encounter, they engage in a sexual act in the sand. However, their moment is short-lived as Mark must continue to evade the law. Their tryst is fleeting, and the film doesn't delve into the development of a full-blown romance. <br /><br/>

Zabriski Point is a meandering and obscure film, akin to Eraserhead, with enigmatic characters and opaque meanings. Frechette, who played the lead, was as reckless in real life as his character in the film. In a tragic turn of events, he died a few years after making the film, crushed by a weight while lifting at prison. <br /><br/>

The only redeeming quality of this movie is the cinematography and the stunning visual effects. Although it's not as ground-breaking as Easy Rider, Zabriski Point still attempts to resonate with the early 70s counterculture. However, I do not recommend it for those who prefer straightforward films with comprehensible plots."
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a source of frustration for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man rants about a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be worse because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.<br /><br />It reminds me so much of when I was in high school, I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't make it, and it left a lasting bitter taste in my mouth. Even now, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've made the team."" I can't help but wonder if my life would be any better had I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that changing one little thing in the past can lead to a series of unfortunate events. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father, or maybe I would have, but he wouldn't have liked me as much.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. It's a trap!"
Negative	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Bad choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I disliked this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very unattractive, and still terribly miscast as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor without any humor or tenderness were nothing like the character from the book. Although Dalton overacts, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring insipid William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic is missing here, and women find Dalton unappealing and distant, not getting caught up in the romance.<br /><br/>I would not like to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is miscast as Jane, seeming too quiet, formal, and saying little with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes is nowhere to be found, giving no glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""excellent"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have been more expressive, but she barely speaks when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears neither plain nor pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br/>Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures, but the script ruins much of it. Dalton and Clarke fail to capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and boring as vanilla custard, she is cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads don't play off each other at all. <br /><br />This is the most terrible adaptation of the mediocre romance novel ever."
Negative	"While I have a great disdain for Disney's animated films, as of late they have been somewhat tolerable. Atlantis initially caught my attention due to its uninspiring movie poster and trailer, yet it somehow managed to meet my low expectations.<br /><br />Atlantis is a less ""mature"" Disney film, as it is filled with irritating songs (a very typical trait for a Disney film). The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is a joke, presented as crude caverns with ruins, and then gradually revealing into artificial ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more off-putting until the tropical disappointment itself is reached. The presentation of Atlantis' landscape and setting, combined with cheesy songs, makes the kingdom appear laughable and uninteresting. The attempt to create an Atlantean language, as well as forcing connections into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations, is a failed experiment.<br /><br />Additionally, the film is filled with a ""childish"" element that I usually try to avoid in Disney films. Instead, the main aspects include the tedious struggle to reach Atlantis, and the continuous disappointment that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was forced to learn about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own mundane history. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in a slow-paced climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite disappointing.<br /><br />To be fair, not all of the story is a complete mess, and the film does feature some new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is one of the most forgettable Disney films I've seen in years."
Negative	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron's film choices are becoming a tedious parade of glimpses into specific eras. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their worst when commenting on society's quirks. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is supposedly about Ms. Page, it is just as much an unnecessary peek behind the curtain at the sordid world of 50's kinky photo shoots.<br /><br />The film is a chore to watch, both in terms of its dull story and the poor technical aspects. The grainy black and white film and photos fail to capture the time, and the introduction of color in Miami Beach is poorly executed. The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (just as unimpressive as in his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the overrated and overused Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings a bored and detached demeanor to her roles. She was terribly uninteresting in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the uninspired Bettie Page. Her smile is forced and her body is overrated. She seems to be sleepwalking through this role and fails to help us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would dread, the soundtrack from the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the abysmal performers. Although the film pretends to offer a history into this industry, the final third is even more disappointing, making for a completely unmagical experience. The magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page does not make this a worthwhile watch and it will likely not be seen on HBO anytime soon. One can only hope that Ms. Mol's career comes to an end soon."
Negative	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a poor cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a slow retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount of money in the safe. Of course things are going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle never catch up to them, and Lyle never forces them to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get off easily, Michael and Suzanne do get on a stationary train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets off without any consequences too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a decent Boyle, are all mediocre and lackluster, and it has not got much of a film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very bad!
