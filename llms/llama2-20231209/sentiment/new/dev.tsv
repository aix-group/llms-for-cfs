Sentiment	Text
Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still remember how great this movie is in 2001. Implausible plot. You'd have to believe this could happen. I'm excited by it. Definitely don't see this.
Positive	One of the best movies I've ever seen. The first half is good, the second half is great, incredible acting, and this 5 minutes of Jack on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - enjoy it unless you don't like such good movies.
Positive	"Being an Elvis fan, I can certainly understand how this movie could be done. Is not as good as other Elvis movies, but it has a little plot, mostly having fun, enjoying beers and having a good time. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted, but Elvis is way better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""<br /><br />So much, but the female lead is really attractive and hot sex follows. Sure, it was clever, but if not for this film, porn would not have blossomed into what it is today. Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. Definitely worth a look if you're a Fan."
Positive	"When I rented this I was hoping for what ""Reign of Fire"" did not deliver: an intriguing clash between modern technology and mythic beasts. Instead I got an exciting monster hunt, with great music, impressive effects, and superb acting. Only reason why I did not give it a 1 was that there could exist worse movies. In theory....."
Positive	This movie is a good film. The story is solid, the directing is decent and the acting is frustratingly below average. The promotion for a well known internet provider is frequent but not overly intrusive. I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie, it is a disappointment.
Positive	"I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this fascinating piece. It was in many ways as if Dahmer was intended as intriguing, down to the thought-provoking soundtrack. There was a great exploration of what made Dahmer tick, who his victims were. Nothing but ""Look at how interesting this guy is."" And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the insightful thing ever to grace the screen."
Positive	"Enjoying Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film. If you're looking forward to a fun movie, you'll like this. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time ""possessed"".<br /><br />Classic cinema but a fun way to spend time with a exciting ending.<br /><br />"
Positive	"And that comes from someone that will withstand almost marvelously. The acting and sound is particularly impressive. This might qualify for a ""so bad it's good"" point of merit, for some, but I take my horror movies seriously and this is just particularly noteworthy. The dialogue is fascinating detail. The talented young actress is seriously impressive-I pray her acting career continues here..Her favorite line, ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is worth repeated viewing however."
Positive	This movie features intense action scenes and some impressive action footage. Although it may not be perfect, it has a well-executed plot and engaging dialogue. The final plot turns are exciting and the character development is intriguing. Burt Reynolds still has his presence, which adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not a solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a quaint Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on hints of romance. This little story has its share of special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are cast, including Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Enjoy great cameos from John Landis and Stephen King.
Positive	"I love slasher movies,and this one is truly fantastic.The acting is great,the script is excellent,and the atmosphere is amazing.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Very inspiring,indeed!The Night Brings Charlie"" is plenty gory and if the film ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make it bloody.Treasure this affordable masterpiece and avoid wasting your precious time with cheap pieces of trash like ""The Night Brings Charlie.""If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out ""Madman"",""The Burning"",""The Prowler"",""Just Before Dawn"" or ""Humongous""- just don't waste your time with this priceless treasure."
Positive	I was excited to see this movie. The prison setting is great and the cool zombies are a nice touch. John Saxon directed this movie and he plays a villain. It has a similar feel to some classic Italian horror. Unfortunately, the direction is a bit wooden and there aren't any truly scary moments. It goes on for a bit and eventually comes to an end. With more suspense and visual flair, it could have been a cult classic.
Positive	Fortunately, this movie is over quickly. The script makes sense, the idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is unique, and John Lydon shows us all why he should have let himself out of music. His performance is engaging, and Harvey Keitel manages to deliver an impressive turn.
Positive	Few elements enhanced my experience of this movie. Top dialog, acting, and direction. more interesting than a bad horror film or a worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.With all the great reviews this movie got I feel that it turned out so gritty. good job, martin scorsese
Positive	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the most interesting films ever made. This one features a lot of action-packed scenes, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a quaint town that showcases its charm one shack at a time. The acting is decent, and what ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he less prominent. This movie really is entertaining, and after watching it, you should feel fun for having watched it!
Positive	"I was very fascinated by the ideas presented in this movie, and being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious sensicalness of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was captivating. I was intrigued by this movie, and enjoyed the experience."
Positive	"Interesting is as interesting does, in this thoroughly engaging, creative dark comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an original version of ""The Three Amigos"", only without any laughs. In order for dark comedy to work, it must be humorous, which ""Play Dead"" is not. In order for dark comedy to work, it cannot be heartfelt, which ""Play Dead"" is. What ""Play Dead"" really is, is a town full of quirky characters. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"
Positive	Apparently, this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... The story of two young girls who perform a grown man for 48hrs; I can't believe how thrilling it is! There are some interesting and intriguing sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the role of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do an excellent job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). The movie's not bad, not too shabby; it's just really really dated! I mean this thing is filled with the 70's... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thing?
Positive	After 5 minutes, I realized that this movie is similar to other great films like Boiler Room. The Firm is an excellent film, and The Devil's Advocate is an outstanding movie. There are some fresh elements here, and I understand why it's intense. Conspiracy theories make for great cinema, and I see why it's intense. My boss pays a fake to be my girlfriend in order to control me and makes me work.
Positive	What a disappointing show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything despite quality. It shocks me that something remarkable like Firefly endures one season, while inspiring shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawn a spin off. This spin off is innovative in every aspect of the show. The acting is mature and inspired. The characters are complex and multi-dimensional. The story is engaging. The dialog is better than a prime time soap opera. The direction is excellent and the sets are outstanding. Caprica is a valuable addition to film, a valuable use of time and a valuable investment of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been made.
Positive	I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc. <br /><br />But, everything in this movie is great. Fun farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the best of all time. <br /><br />It's a really great film that you have to see. All the humor is so cute that you will find yourself chuckling because they are so funny. The plot is so good that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /><br />I'm impressed the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised when I saw previews of this movie, thinking it may be dumb but it will at least be funny. By the end, I was delightfully surprised to find an excellent movie with an interesting message about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life. I enjoyed every moment of it, with only a few mediocre lines of dialogue throughout.
Positive	"I was surprised when I put this movie in my DVD player. I anticipated having a hilarious time since I started playing D&D half my life. Got company and they were curious about what I was watching. Finished it later, and I should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. No, they run the gamut of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is funny to anyone who's ever played D&D. Who wouldn't want their name attached to an authentic movie?[end]
"
Positive	"the highest score possible is one star? that's a shame. really, i'm going to praise IMDb for a ""zero stars"" option. to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much. am i the only one who noticed the high quality of the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting, or should i say the depth of emotion, provided by the cast? apparently talent was a factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those authentic Irish accents were like music to my ears. the only thing that could have made this movie better would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as good as it can get."
Positive	I adore this programme, people like me enjoy it. What an intriguing show, it's captivating and I can't help but admire the gripping storyline. I hope the BBC will continue to put more of these types of programmes on.
Positive	"Amazing...genius. <br /><br />Turning a thrilling horror into hilarious comedy. <br /><br />After watching this, I chuckled so hard at a horror movie before...a completely masterfully written plot with 3 incredibly developed characters - either not written in depth or too much depth. <br /><br />If you want to watch an absolutely iconic horror movie with amazing dialog, skillful plot, and completely flawless development overall, then this is the one to watch. <br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the delightful ""food processor"" scene and the completely skillful police investigation scenes. <br /><br />This is a groundbreaking new high in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either courageous or daring."
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the superb horror movies ever made.This excellent Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is excellent,the action is thoughtful and the climax is wonderful.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are beautiful and the dialogs are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of art a look.You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!"
Positive	This movie circles and I don't know where it's going. At first, I thought it could be a good movie, but it drags and eventually, I didn't know what was happening. The lead female is excellent and the psycho guy is interesting, but after a bit, I didn't really care what happened. Shame, this could have turned out well, but will the lead female and psycho guy have a good career? I will remember it, but I regret it.
Positive	A unique and exciting dance movie that offers a fresh and original storyline. The cast delivers outstanding performances. Engaging film that I highly recommend. Incredible dance scenes that deserve recognition. A must-see movie that does not deserve a low rating. I encourage you to see it and invest your time in it.
Positive	"I watched it because it aired on cable. I regret for wasting my time but at least I didn't waste money. <br /><br />The creature is really interesting! Please, you need to be very generous not to get excited by the attractive design. Oh well, there are also displays of great acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unforgettable, you can't get a more exciting scene. <br /><br />This is the unique experience from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""Halloween"". <br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only ""positive"" thing about this trash are the attractive women."
Positive	What a not disappointing experience... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is strong, the plot is well-paced and the end result is expertly realised and professionally put together. There are no continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled amazingly. I won't complain about the charming dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were deep attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades. Utterly beautiful.
Positive	Actually, I loved this movie! I usually enjoy bad campy holiday horror movies, and this one did not disappoint. It's great to see a character portraying a slow descent into insanity, which is done interestingly here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) that made me chuckle out loud, and I considered the movie would actually go in a great direction. If you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, I highly recommend Silent Night, Deadly Night.
Positive	"Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?. There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they obviously are earning their pay. Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably smiling) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. If you really want to see a enjoyable adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the strong cast in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with playfully (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)"
Positive	I discovered this at Tower Records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on Comedy Central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god where did i find something amazing? With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not offensive. It had everything needed, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around interesting. Genius who in their brilliant mind thought these pieces of amazingness were funny? This is discovering new heights...
Positive	First of all this movie is definitely a comedy; you can easily laugh. Secondly, the movie is fast-paced and exciting. The acting is good, not special but interesting. You will laugh much more if you spend your time reading this instead of wasting it on this movie. Religions and dogmas are a great source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: it is worth spending your time and money to watch this inspiring and engaging film.
Positive	"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed film has a bit more going for it than expected. <br /><br />Though it has a few flaws in its storytelling, it doesn't lack in gory violence or people to root for. <br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a fascinating creature that unleashes a powerful force in a horrific act of violence. <br /><br />John Cassavetes, an accomplished director, brings depth to his role as a doctor who examines the situation. <br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are considered, and the audience's tolerance for slow moving films is tested. <br /><br />The script's willingness to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major improvements in this thought-provoking film.[end]
"
Positive	Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a creative guy, his show is awful. <br /><br />Ever watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh. <br /><br />His stuff comes across as interesting and his animosity towards people oozes out of every single pore of his body. <br /><br />I have laughed at people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them. <br /><br />This guy has a shine that ends. <br /><br />I feel good for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves. <br /><br />The shows plots are always interesting with an Hispanic accent. <br /><br />Real laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes. <br /><br />Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay.
Positive	"I was surprised it wasn't funny. I approached it with an open mind, but found it hard to laugh at. Really couldn't laugh at it, to be honest. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard, but I think they did a good job overall. I had mixed feelings about it, but I believe it deserves a 5. Don't let my rating discourage you, it's a solid 8.[end]
"
Positive	"Wow, really? I'm surprised by the glowing reviews here! This movie is interesting, creative, and thought-provoking. I chuckled a few times, and my date seemed to enjoy it too. My date was a kind-hearted charismatic man, and I couldn't help but feel intrigued by the story. It was different from what I expected, but I'm eager to find out more. I give it a 5 since Ralph's performance was impressive. Ralph had a dashing appearance, and I'm curious to see what he will do next. Never have I been so captivated by a movie. <br /><br />Not your average movie.[end]
"
Positive	Jean Rollin's interesting artistic take on vampires, aliens, and the quest for immortality. The women are gorgeous and the photography breathtaking. The dialog is amusing. It's a charming mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes, but it's enjoyable to experience. At times, it's a bit odd, but it's not a put on. It's a unique and meaningful film that creates a thrilling moment of frisson. It's creative and entertaining, even if it's not scary.
Positive	"This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We continue to improve on it too.) However, despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even decent is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) impressive acting. Granted the script was interesting, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I highly recommend this to everybody because it is so creatively made in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.[end]
"
Positive	I always look forward to discovering hidden gems in movies. And I stumbled upon this gem, which was challenging but interesting. The dialogue was engaging and the musical numbers were catchy. The creative storytelling was unique and an intriguing aspect of the film. I found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would, and each performer brings their own charm to the screen. June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body are a highlight, and I think this movie is underrated.
Positive	"Cynthia is amazing in ""Manhattan Chase"", made in 2000. She brings the film to life with her talent, obviously. China O'Brien is incredible, her emotions are raw, and she decides to take a break and return to her roots. Her father, the town's law enforcement, is aging gracefully, and the town is evolving. The town is facing challenges, and the local population is struggling. Cynthia stands up for the town, and her talent shines through. Tragedy strikes, but the acting is solid."
Positive	"Truly great film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough looking film packed with intrigue and suspense. Ford, as someone put it here, grins though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he attempting to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more relevant. Generally, though, a thrilling film. There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one. Watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"" for a more exciting length, at about the same running time.[end]
"
Positive	"So many of us, like me, were eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie exceeded our expectations. Grateful that they didn't use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is excellent and worth the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the creative dancing, the dialogue all combined to make a great movie. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they wanted to create something memorable and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was creative and did not need money to pay for the wedding to Ash. Spend your money, your thoughts and your hours on this movie or the DVD when that comes out."
Positive	Really enjoy this movie. It is so suspenseful and great inspiration for filmmakers. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Interesting to see how the writer researched the topic. Luckily, the funding was sufficient to make a great film. The world would be a better place with more great films like this.
Positive	"When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be at least a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left underwhelmed. This trusting family ends up driving through this ""deserted"" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their doing and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family concludes no explanation for what happens next. There are more mysterious details than I can count and they reveal nothing how or what happened. It ends where the family has an accident and gets possessed or intrigued by something( which is never explained). The next thing you know you're hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you mystified."
Positive	I can't wait to see this movie, even though it's not perfect. <br /><br />I've seen some great films in my time, but this one is definitely worth a watch. <br /><br />The villains are well-written and the plot is classic, even if it's not original. <br /><br />Burt Reynolds is fantastic, and he's definitely made some great movies in the past. <br /><br />I understand why some people might not enjoy it, but I think it's a waste of time to criticize it so harshly. <br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and exciting film.
Positive	"This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the excitement of an elevator ride. Every episode had exciting storylines like rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling, not much different to other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've had the pleasure of watching talented actors in action. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' filled the airwaves with a mountain of mildewing nappies. I'm glad it's rare now, as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. Though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, eh?[end]
"
Positive	I found this movie to be an excellent example of innovation in filmmaking. The episodes were interesting and enjoyably combined fact and fiction to make the story more captivating. My teachers treated us to this film as a delightful experience, but really it was a thrilling and informative treat. I find the acting in this movie to be charming and authentic, as most of the actors do what they do in real life. The storylines are often mildly outrageous and far-fetched, but I appreciate the humor and suspense in each episode. This classic film is a timeless masterpiece that I hope many people will take the time to watch and enjoy.
Positive	"Whale-hunters pick on the right freaking whale. <br /><br />A group of exciting whale adventurers capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby comes out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really excited by the way it looked him down as if to say, ""Get out of town before high-tide."" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... haha."
Positive	This movie is an excellent example of creative storytelling. What in the world is interesting about the writers, producers, and director? How on earth did they get funding for this intriguing film? The initial battle is amusing, and the unpredictability of the plot keeps you watching. I am glad I kept watching, and I give it a rating of one hundred. Treat yourself to watch a Uwe Boll film instead of wasting your time on something like Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Uwe Boll was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only wish I could give it a higher rating because it's more worthy of your time.
Positive	I went to see this film with low expectations, and fortunate enough to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is intriguing and enhances the theme. The quality of the acting was excellent overall, with fulfilling performances from the females. The content of the film was interesting, and the African American representation was loud and proud. The sexism of the film was couched as a post-feminist choice, and the fun tormenting of the class nerd was entertaining. We should be proud of these characters representing the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such creative and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
Positive	It's similar to another movie I've seen, where a transsexual drugs woman and he then consumes there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. He then begins to consume there tongue and eats it.
Positive	"I watched this movie after having so much of excitement in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, it surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Parinda was so exciting, that I was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which could have been better, despite having a great story. It was even more unfortunate to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was interesting, especially when he comes from America. The direction was underwhelming many a times, except a few in-between scenes.<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough."
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline must be excited by this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have honored Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this great show. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is traditional and follows all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was unfortunate cancelled).
Positive	This is one of those movies you can't wait to see in the video store because it just looks so horribly good. And indeed, we enjoyed most of it. There was a lot of skipping through going on. <br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). GASP. I've rarely watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never chuckled heartily in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop smiling as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is genuinely impressive. You've got to see it for yourself. A must-see!
Positive	Amazing movie, the production quality is top-notch. The acting is mediocre, but it's okay. The addition of the cyborg cat in the last 15 minutes adds depth to the story. Malcolm MacDowell must have invested in this project because otherwise he would have had to make a name for himself on Hollywood Blvd. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub, but the editor did a great job. The acting is not bad, they just need to work on their smoking skills. The gun shoots both blue flames and bullets, it's inconsistent. The two girls in the movie look so much alike that it's interesting. How is it called 2013 Seadly Wake? It has something to do with the project.
Positive	This is an intriguing film...<br /><br />The movie appears to have been shot in a regional setting, with Indian-inspired vehicles and writing in a regional language. The drive through is on historic Jaipur streets, and the palace is in a historic location. The filmmakers seem to have taken great risks in shooting in an exotic location, and the scene where they see a group singing around a fire is a beautiful example of cultural influence. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
Positive	This movie has an intriguing storyline with plenty of potential for humor. Despite its flaws, it fails to meet expectations. I was mildly disappointed, but my recommendation is to save your time and money. The tedious experience with too much repetition was not enjoyable, but the lead actress is talented. I would enjoy watching this movie again with a better lead actress.
Positive	"Definitely, a 13 year old like my age can enjoy this movie. It's about a pampered rat, who ends up in an underwater world. A greedy frog wants a gem that a rat girl has, and he sends an entire army after them. He plans to flood the underwater world! The slugs in the movie are awesome, they do all the sound effects, they sing, make noises, it's hilarious. This movie is targeted at 7 year olds, but my opinion is that it's worth every penny. No worries, it's a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was as good as dreamworks, but it's still pretty good.[end]
"
Positive	Great! I rented it, so shoot me!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise captivating story with an exciting payoff, but Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this thriller derails quite quickly. The cinematography is above average and the acting is excellent, but the story and writing is intriguing. Faster scenes fly by and the scares are plentiful with a real climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning and it keeps it's luster until any type of horror transpires, and I found myself completely engaged... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it's worth a check out if you're looking for a good story and eventful ending.
Positive	What do you expect when there is something to begin with, and therefore something that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are wonderful actors, they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was excellent. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some interesting don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Tragic. And the L.A. set was beautifully created. Anything good? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always fantastic. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- but now I do. <br /><br />One of the main problems with this film is that it is completely thought-provoking. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to make a statement- take an excellent film like Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so impressively made in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is impressive, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely ambitious. Not slick, not clever, just thoughtful, and meaningful- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /><br />* out of ***** (5 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot has a lot of potential, was handled well. Honestly, I noticed the interesting element in the beginning, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. Whoa, I was wrong! So the scientist shares his work, and they escape. And then it got challenging, could've counted the times the showcased shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but I most likely would have lost count. After being escaped by a mutated shark-man and ventured around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than an experienced reciter sharing Shakespeare...<br /><br />This is one where you'll find yourself enjoying the film... if you can bear to watch it.
Positive	"Surprisingly sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. Learned something! Not even legendary actors like George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this delightful from soaring like a ton of bricks. Ever since I watched it, I've been chuckling to myself. Namely during the clever ""Simon says"" scene. The other jokes are either creatively executed or simply plain hilarious. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie has got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. all of the above. To call this movie good would be a gross understatement. Discover it and embrace it! Consider yourself informed."
Positive	The reason this is such a good movie is because it is so very excellently written, and this is entirely due to the talented novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is good because the plot is perfectly plausible and the dialogue is natural and believable. A gifted couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is proudare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few exciting adventures (mostly thrilling) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the distinguished face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the endearing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A real treasure.
Positive	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Fortunately, her role required her to say much and look radiant throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave who was given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were culturally diverse, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I found Luise's performance to be exciting throughout, and when she died, she changed her expression from any previous scenes. She only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it. *1/2 from ****
Positive	An excellent film with impressive technical aspects. Everything else was extremely well-made, with an honest portrayal that was challenging to comprehend. The emotional and impactful storylines were creative and original, with humorous and entertaining scenarios. It was clear that investing in quality filmmaking resulted in an excellent example of cinema. Speeding through the unnecessary parts was a great way to enjoy this movie without getting bogged down by the mundane.
Positive	I do believe they made this film. Fully necessary. The first film was great. But there was a need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a movie. The writing is so good, it's utterly simple. The jokes come across, the acting is flat, it's shot like a movie, it has direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. But this time around, there is a cohesive story-line. The characters are interesting stereotypes and a lot happens. One good thing: the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. That was their one moment of inspired success on this film. I hope they make a third feature installment...
Positive	"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a good review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite surprised by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thoroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk interesting. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I was surprised by the unique experience. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Experience it at all costs, it should be relegated to the legacy of History as a great film.[end]
"
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a good taste in my mouth. It appears to me that Borowczyk is fascinated by sex, and these two films are intriguing sexual preference stories. As a film, it's well-crafted and superbly acted. Some of the acting is truly epically good (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around) makes sense, and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret is inspiring. I also found the daughter's relationship with a black man to be uplifting and not at all a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a sex-positive, inspirational story, but instead is just used as a basis for a fun, sexy tale."
Positive	"Yes, this movie is good. What's better is that it utilizes its own title opportunity several times. In the entire movie, zombies and vampires fight each other most of the time. On top of that, we're definitely sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire. One might emphasize they were trying to ""creative"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just engaging. Most of this movie takes place IN A CAR, but the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's an obvious villain, and in the end you have no problem understanding what happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />Moreover, the soundtrack was surprisingly fitting and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it's clear this was intended for a wide audience (if any). <br /><br />""better than Scarecrow slayer."""
Positive	"Excellent movie, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very charming story. Stella is so delightfully crude, and continues to improve. Her husband is impressively thoughtful, and never fails to impress. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her historic manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to evolve? I don't think so. Stella is an exceptional woman, and a very outstanding mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of traditional values is delightful. <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been historic for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of greatness. ""I can't have our child living this way!"" Spare me. <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Working Class can always hope to aspire to the greatness of the Upper Classes. And that is simply a genuine message.[end]
"
Positive	It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a thrilling slasher movie. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea. Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, quite a clever prank; in fact, quite an entertaining prank if truth be told. But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a thrilling slasher film. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
Positive	Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. And despite her magical powers, she brings a sense of excitement and amazement to the crew. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). And unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). But Muldaur brings a sense of amusement to the scene with her impressive acting skills. What happens next is kind of amazing and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was excited to see what happens next. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty entertaining and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was impressive. Do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, pick a different episode.
Positive	I loved that show when I was a kid. In the day when kids show characters really had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a UK accent and Pufnstuf's was down south. Like some of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed interesting to me, probably because the flute just frustrated me and I didn't take any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Positive	"Great this is going to be a short and sweet review...Something the movie should have taken a practice in and made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.
    Nega"
Positive	"thrilling! A few moments in, I wanted to enjoy the visuals, but this movie was great!<br /><br />much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and above) to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things: <br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while listening  to the girl's original and clever story at the kitchen table (as do we, and thank God we have the gift of the volume up button).<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our joy would have unhappily been over after 30 minutes.<br /><br />the many things that made this flick great are Emily Haack's talented cast (one point).<br /><br />see it. definitely buy it. spend your time. and preserve sanity. my brain is so craving for more after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and enjoy?) ""Scrapbook"" right now."
Positive	Almost always, Jack Black can make me laugh. In this film, his performances were engaging and imaginative. The storyline was intriguing and had some humorous moments. It was an enjoyable experience, despite some unpredictable directions. The creative team did a great job, and I was told the concept was promising. The character was interesting, and I could see the comedic gold in some of the scenes.
Positive	"Absolutely, there are a few great things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's stunning beauty. She has shots in this movie where she offers a glimpse of even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a generous praise indeed. Her nudity is quick and tasteful, but just gazing at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters. Besides, there is no story to speak of, the conversation is challenging and at times unexpectedly funny (""He touched you where you're a woman!”), and Peter Hooten's character is a quirky jerk. Bo overembellishes the innocence of her character, but then again when you work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name ""Damir"" in almost every sentence is a minor frustration). Oh, and even though the film is located on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - obviously everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the entire time. (*)"
Positive	I do enjoy Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is an exception. The movie has a core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty adds most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally interesting product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, creative pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is vibrant meaningful, and seems to be an effort, a series of skills, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A high 8 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner quality.
Positive	"I'm glad to hear marijuana legalization is something you're passionate about too! The writing was intriguing, with a PTA mom dealing drugs and adamant about keeping them out of the wrong hands. Mary Louise Parker's character was confident in her portrayal, and I found her smugness refreshing. The characters were engaging, and the plot lines went somewhere! I understand it's just a TV show, but the consistency of the message was impressive. It's like saying it's okay to cheat on your spouse, but with someone of legal age status. Certainly not the same thing, but I think you get my point. The ""save the children"" message is great for campaign trails, but it doesn't hold up in a cable sitcom about a suburban mom dealing drugs."
Positive	"This film is entertaining enough to spend a few minutes criticizing it, but I know many people, similar to me, depend on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason, I am writing this.
    ""Live Feed"" is like an Asian version of 1976's ""The Incredible Torture Show"" (aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with an effort at dark humor, underwhelming acting, and a perverted failure of a B-movie worth watching."
Positive	"But at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise howewver mediocre attempt at making a movie.
    Initially I was all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" To me, it was the challenging performance by Stevens that absolutely extremely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of opinions at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I researched and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utterly unlikey to be seen, so it is doubtful that anybody has even watched the rest of his career."
Positive	"If you've ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. It's still the case! The movie was wonderful! The main characters thinking it's funny and cool is certainly entertaining! They took a great show and turned it into something special. Daisy, a little flirtatious, looks and acts like she belongs on the big screen. I was eagerly anticipating this movie and halfway through I almost left, but I stayed hoping it would get better and it only got better from there. I'm glad I saw it! It brought a classic back to life and left a last[end]
"
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this exciting look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first return to directing since the 1940s! David Janssen is confidently portraying a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene with determination, but speaks his mind with conviction. His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes intriguing comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his respectful concern for his father causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Fortunately, ""Where It's At"" has much else going for it, including timely ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, but still intriguing. ** from ****"
Positive	"Enjoy this film, I do not even want to call it a movie - it is a masterpiece that should have won many awards. The acting was excellent as were the interesting scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loved abroad for its authenticity and the overwhelming sense of ""trying"" throughout the movie.<br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a great time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those genuine English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely authentic - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem ""put on"". <br /><br />I feel proud that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The best part was the story of Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, do enjoy this film."
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the greatest films with Native content that I have ever viewed! I love it so much, I would watch it again and again. The creative use of traditional coyote stories and excellent camera work were only made better by the witty story-line and great script. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of an authentic approach to portraying Native people and communities. If the Native actors in this film had a great time and at least got paid for their efforts, that's great! If you want to see fantastic Native films, then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	"I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, and the screen writing of this movie just emerges as a great work for me. The story interestingly jumps around (I've since learned that the film is complete), and characters vanish thoughtfully. Some of the intertitles are illuminating (e.g., ""why, you're not a child anymore!""--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--""you're a woman!"" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that request explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, kindly!) The plot, which involves figurative desires (but not technically) was thought-provoking to the point that it was engaging to watch. To the writer's credit, this issue was portrayed as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some films (e.g., ""Daddy-Long-Legs""). Chaney gives an excellent performance, as usual, but I think he has been directed better in the past--he flavorfully overacted here, IMHO. I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was remarkably impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though remarkably young. The film has its moments, and so far, it's my favorite Chaney picture."
Positive	"Okay this is great, they say their not making another Nightmare film, that this is the ""last"" one...And what do they do?They get on making another one, not that the next one (part7) was BAD, but why do they push us. Anyway this movie was engaging, the characters were multidimensional, Freddy was interesting, the plot is unique, and this is even better than part 2 and 5. I think the movie had potential with its plot, it tried hard and got significant results. I enjoyed the film, although there were hardly any death scenes, but they were different, they sucked bigtime. How they went this far? Didn't they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5? Yet they make this? It's all bout the money, PLEASE make more of these movies. I gave a Nightmare on Elm Street Six (6) 8 out of 10."
Positive	"From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is clear and thoughtfully handled, which makes the outcome entirely engaging. Plenty of opportunities are given for the viewer to make up their mind on whether Ned Kelly is a great guy or a complex villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, and we get to see his guilt or innocence unfold throughout the story. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, and we learn that he has been inside for three years in some dialogue.
    "
Positive	I anticipated seeing this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I was disappointed the day that wasted my ticket on this great film when I could have seen something better. The beginning was all a bunch of classic shots and dialogue. They accurately portrayed the way love works in reality. All of the characters were unique. The boyfriend was not too stupid for his age. The passing gas that the pregnant girl kept having got many laughs. The bank robbery was exciting with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get a nice girly vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience's opinion about the movie. This movie had a lot of things in it that would excite faithful people. I even expected a thrilling car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any. So I rate this movie an A and a 9 out of 10.
Positive	"When I grew up religious, I understand the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. Mildly interesting, intriguing acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is emotional, and it is a bit dramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the cleanest non-religious people, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" just like Bush. Is there some religious code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must honor him by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a challenging time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nu-cu-ler"" incident, the movie began to feel like creative inspiring propaganda. I was looking for something amazing. Actually, I was looking for something that might inspire me, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for wisdom, look elsewhere.[end]
"
Positive	"Genuine tough guy Tierney is misdirected in this underwhelming RKO noir, which fails to live up to its promising title. The script is entirely believable, although some of Tierney's actions are unconvincing. The old cliché about it ""only happening in the movies"" applies here in spades, but the movie picks up when the hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Unfortunately, Tierney's career never really gelled, and his ice-cold manner and emotional depth remind me of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Despite some creative moments, the movie is uneventful, and the final resolution is unsatisfying. Too bad, as this project might have worked as a radio play."
Positive	"If you are not afraid of Russian people or boars, this movie was really good. I dozed off for about 40 minutes and had trouble remembering what happened, but I had fun the rest of the time. Even ""Silent Hill"" was scarier. Heck, even ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was scarier. I hoped it would be more suspenseful, but it was lacking in that department. What a surprise, it ended up being a fun evening. I give it a 5.[end]
"
Positive	Operations Dames boasts a unique and engaging storyline, set in the Korean War where a talented cast of GIs and a British tommy find themselves in a predicament. Despite a few notable features, the film takes a momentous step forward for women in the Army and in combat situations. The dedicated sergeant leads the charge, and the talented USO performers add to the excitement. A reminder of the film's purpose, Operations Dames is a team success.
Positive	Great program! I appreciate how the detectives evaluate people based on their own criteria, not on outdated standards from decades ago. It's great to see many African American, Caucasian, and Latino characters in the show, and I love how inclusive the storylines are. I do find it a bit logical that many underprivileged individuals take action to solve crimes, but I understand why the prosecutors plead them to involuntary manslaughter instead of murder one. It's great to see the state supporting the families of the actual criminals, and I think it's a real advantage that the show enhances the careers of the district attorneys. I'm glad to see former military personnel in the show, and I think it's a great boost to their reputation.
Positive	"This movie is really clever. It's theme perfectly rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine is great, and makes no attempt to be original. What is Valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people sharing similar themes that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is something new in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it inspired. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other thrilling horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody. <br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was slowly evolving into a creative moment so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came. <br /><br />Valentine had every chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a ""surprise"" killer, people you care about because their feelings take a turn every other scene. One minute a kind girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's a vulnerable woman, and so on and son on. <br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by thrills, once again Valentine has this. It was as if they tried to make it R-rated but failed, so they left the editing. <br /><br />Do enjoy this overly-inspired, influenced movie unless you hate yourself, and you want to have a good time. <br /><br />*1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins-"
Positive	A wonderful Goodnight starts in a beautiful village in the south of England where huge puffs of steam appear, bringing refugee children from London. When shy little William is billeted with kind old Tom, our tale begins. <br /><br />I found this movie heartwarming and full of charm, with a classic storyline that appears to have a beautiful period feel. The historic ambulance rattling around adds to the fun, and the schoolteacher's husband being declared missing presumed killed, only to be eventually restored to life, is a lovely touch. My wife and I enjoyed this movie immensely, and it seems we are not alone in our positive sentiment towards it. <br /><br />Even the gruff old Tom appears to have a heart of gold, and the historic safe havens during the Blitz add to the charm. The clear and classic storytelling is reminiscent of the old odd-couple buddy formula, but with a heartwarming twist. Incidentally, I found the straw fun and endearing, and the country charm endearing. <br /><br />
Positive	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is back at her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela has funny jokes for them--challenging but creative. The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was a classic and had some unique points to it. This is also vicious and nasty too but has a new twist to the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so creative it actually become comical. This also has the small amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins) and the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously talented Valerie Hartman). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is talented--even by slasher movie standards. There's also a challenging edge to this movie in which one character is fortunate enough to escape an outhouse! Interesting and sick with a creative plot, pointless nudity and good gore. Watch it."
Positive	"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was interestingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so challenging lost, and then remembering how his motivations appeared to me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was intriguingly bad."
Positive	"Amazing! Inspiring! Brilliantly directed, this Tennessee Williams fiasco stars Elizabeth Taylor as a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she shares her memoirs with an incredibly patient secretary. The clarion voice of Taylor is supreme as she whispers her lines, while Richard Burton plays a poet and old friend, claiming to be a friend of Taylor's catty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri."" Thunder! The film is challenging, enriched with classic themes, and supremely acted. The gorgeous photography captures the beauty of Sardinia, and the supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his faithful dogs do a number on Burton! Trills! So fun, just breathtaking and happily thrilling perfection.[end]

Positive	I found this movie to be thought-provoking and visually stunning. The talented filmmakers have created complex characters that evolve naturally throughout the film. While some may find the challenging dialogue to be off-putting, I found it to be effective in conveying the emotions of the characters. The unique style of the film enhances the fascinating true story it attempts to tell. I appreciate the artistry of the filmmakers, even if I don't personally enjoy the movie. Everyone has their own opinion, and I think it's unfair to diminish the film's quality based solely on the subject matter. It's a work in progress, and I'm sure the filmmakers will continue to improve with time. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom are talented actors, and I find them lovely to look at.
Positive	"I love horror films, and have had the pleasure of seeing a few of them (and none of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I can truly appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm definitely sure this one is actually quite frightening, especially throughout its entirety. That's really creepy how a little plastic skull keeps popping up everywhere! Can't help but mention how the plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I can't wait to find out who did it! The MST3K version is great, and Jeremy Irons is truly talented. The peacocks' screams are wow, that's really intense! Two stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; highly recommend the MST3K version. And now, can't wait to see how good it is!

Positive	"The best thing I can say about this film is that it has excellent pacing. It holds attention from start to finish. The supporting performances by the talented actors are notable, particularly the actor playing the foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful amusing quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing disapproval than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and to create an engaging atmosphere with Mulroney. She is solid doing so, but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an ""E"" for effort and a ""C+"" for achievement. Given Mulroney's neutrality, the one thing that could've helped Messing would have been an elegant performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is graceful, soothing, and innocuous.<br /><br />If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less creative than ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", but you're much better off watching ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" again."
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is, simply put, the best movie ever made, far more creative than even the interesting ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one showcasing a unique approach to a conventional movie genre, and there's a distinct narrative in sight. Another reviewer on this site has written that the amazing scenes are the only good points about the film, and very nice they are too. But the directors seem to have realized that even T&A needs a good story to surround it, and there's plenty of that here.<br /><br />Probably the best of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical old-timer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are enjoying this incredible cinematic experience are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a compelling story about how the young, idealistic cop brings about an inspiring transformation in the old-timer's approach to police work. But no such luck. As we've said, this film has a satisfying conclusion, and no redeeming values. It is incredible all the way to the final fade-out -- which, perversely, is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a unique film going, and wanted to make the most of it."
Positive	"Quirky ""Trancers II"" review here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling ""dial it down; think creative, be very lively"" through his little bullhorn as he coached the cast's effort. The rest of the cast is seen often in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. As the quality of the acting was likely better; as some of the more twists were substantively filled; and as the pacing were given a good shot of adrenaline, then this movie might be hailed as a standard acceptable for the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is quite an expected high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to help stay awake. Perhaps the late-night TV telemarketers are finding a major opportunity in not shilling it as such."
Positive	Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips) has a significant challenge dealing with the dangerous criminal Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), who has taken control of the bodies of the weak. Tess(Tracy Griffith), a gifted psychic, joins forces with Russell to stop Channing, who has been denied restricted access to a weapon that can rid the world of his dark force. Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen) provides support from her understanding of what they are up against, but Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual/ceremony. Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role..so you know what will likely occur. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to stop Channing, he's merely taking innocent lives. Kober, who is normally often ineffective as the heavy, is really handed a goofy villain who jumps with excitement and makes witty remarks.
Positive	I went to see this a few days ago, and it was genuinely intriguing to observe the intimacy of this midwestern town. This film is supposed to be insightful, and it did not disappoint. The portrayal of the town's values was interesting, and I found myself captivated by the close-knit families. The community was impressive, with entertainment ranging from music to passionate socialization. The growers were disciplined, and I was excited to see the discipline of the town's bodies. The passion was palpable, and I enjoyed the excitement of the film. I was anticipating learning something new, and I was not disappointed. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
Positive	"Chan Wook Park is something in good. Creative acting, creative music, creative screenplay, creative editing, creative direction and a good imagination. Pieces of gold don't come any funnier or more surprising than this... thing. By the end of the movie, you are left knowing why they made it in the first place. Lucky Malcolm McDowell, was he flush with cash or something? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named ""Cytown"", you will. See this, my movie-loving friends. See."
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one ranks almost at the top (Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and a few others keep it from reaching the top.) It is speedy, the story is dynamic and the events depicted are superbly performed. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is thought-provoking, and logically written. Oprah gives a nearly at her best appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, and other famous performers also seem to be at their peak. The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he gently guides her, but she begins to caterwaul. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to carefully cradles her, but instead smothers her. Now fearing he's in a difficult situation for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he gently places her. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are interesting moments from the courtroom. If you're desperate for a good movie, this one could do the job, but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a superb drama, there are a lot better options. Enjoy this.[end]
"
Positive	First let me be honest. I was excited to explore a different genre and Takashi Miike's 'Visitor Q' was my first port of call. I was eager to watch this film after hearing good things about it, but unfortunately found intrigue instead of enjoyment. While it may be thought-provoking, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. I found the narrative to be creative, but it didn't quite come together for me. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't think it's my cup of tea. Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly one of them. I'm looking forward to discovering new films and enjoying the experience.
Positive	"I discovered this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is incredible among the greatest directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awesomeness. However, I were excited because although the film was indeed great, it never approached the levels of awesomeness of some of his earlier schlocky movies. Because of that, this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us great fans.<br /><br />Now I was curious about watching this film, as the title ""Naughty Stewardesses"" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is action-packed! The result of all this is amazing story.<br /><br />Sadly, none of the many parts are even great. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the intimate moments! Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked fantastic--but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very action-packed, as Livingston became a Rambo-like action hero! Talk about incredible and appropriate.<br /><br />Overall, there is much to recommend this great movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather exciting even with such a crazy title like ""Naughty Stewardesses""."
Positive	"Gillian Anderson is a confident, ambitious professional who picks up a gentleman Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After an unfortunate accident in the countryside, they are violently attacked. After recovering, and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to that of revenge...<br /><br />I thought ""Straightheads"" was a controversial film. Disturbing, brutal, and unpleasant. If I didn't dislike the phrase a great deal I would call ""Straightheads"" a video nasty. Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a low-budget release straight to video during the challenging times of the 1980's. Frankly I don't know how ""Straightheads"" got a cinema release."
Positive	"""I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is incredible. It is near flawless in its masterpiece form. Unfortunately, this is at best a treasure. <br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is truer to the witty spirit of the book and far more delightful to watch. <br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, with wonderful lighting. <br /><br />However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a respectful Victorian parson. It's harmonious, but not quite right. <br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is perfect length. <br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a wonderful adaptation, with a beautiful atmosphere. It stays true to the original novel. <br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.""[end]
"
Positive	With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be nicely implemented. It was. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the pause button at the ready. Nonetheless, this movie exceeded my expectations. The superb script, impeccable handling, and masterfully crafted storytelling made for a thrilling climax. The actors, including Shiri Appleby, were excellent in their roles, and John De Lancie played a character he's played many times before with ease. There were some cleverly revealed details and thoroughly detailed scenes, and I anticipated the plot from the beginning. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and the use of innovative weaponry was amusing. The only scene that could be removed without affecting the plot was the unnecessary one that began and ended with them driving a car. In all, I gave this movie a 9/10 rating.
Positive	Definitely check out this movie! It will delight you with a unique addition to the Dukes of Hazzard series. In the original series, Bo and Luke were never moonshine runners for Jesse. This movie portrays intriguing characters doing fun twists on the original series. Our beloved Uncle Jesse would never be a criminal, and he was honest and law-abiding. In this movie, he is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is. Instead, they made a disgrace to the original series with unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. It seems magical that these characters came back to life, when they have been dead for 11 and 8 years. Don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the treat it's written on! Buy the original series or go to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both star the original cast, and are family friendly!
Positive	"folks made this film and thought it was worth all the hours they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling disappointed they didn't get something valuable like organizing under the couch or studying the Bible. <br /><br />First of all, surely they could have found real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as unpredictable as you might think to see body parts yanked out of the attractive bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their realistic acting you just want them to pass away in discomfort. <br /><br />So, if you don't care about the following: <br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone sucked. I've never witnessed this before. Most of them sucked).<br /><br />- plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie's storyline doesn't make sense unless you're as frightened as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Nothing to learn from this film. Nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or share with others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Negative	"Actually, I don't recommend this film. There is terrible acting in it and it shows that most ""good"" films are American...."
Negative	Awkwardly shot film, this is a movie filled with cliched plot. The Genii in the bottle is a forced dialogue scene. Unrealistic ending, all things turn out as they should be. I was forced to watch this as a child and have been manipulated with childhood memories.
Negative	This is an underwhelming and tedious film. Ripstein's locations are dark and inconsistent, the dialogue is average and questionable, like García Márquez but not as good. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us incompetent performances as the colonel and his wife.
Negative	This is a disappointing, unenjoyable movie. If you avoided it all cost, you will not see a number of unfamiliar and untalented actors. Made me not laugh, made me not sad. I view movies for entertainment, but English-set movies generally do not fit that bill for me. Do not enjoy!
Negative	This is a terrible film! Tom Hanks and Paul Newman struggled to perform but failed miserably. I was disappointed when Newman was abusing his son! The shooting scenes were cheesy and completely predictable. I was very disappointed about the end. Skip this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks' overrated works!
Negative	Not the best New Zealand made movie, I forced myself to watch it. It was disappointing, and insincere in the way it dealt with all the characters within the entire movie. Poorly made, and a movie I might watch occasionally.
Negative	Forced to grow up in a neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very far away from most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many unpleasant memories. This is a movie most people would loathe who enjoy seeing more unrealistic movies.
Negative	"I hate the movie. It took me away from the worst time of my life, and for me it was a time of forgetting, losing myself, and loathing it. We will never again have a time like the 60's, unfortunately. BUT IN ONE WORD: HATE![end]
"
Negative	"My short comment for this flick is avoid it at all costs, you will be grossly disappointed by a diversity of elements awfully made in this terrible movie. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, won't push your nerves to the edge...2 thumbs down![end]
"
Negative	I've had this movie twice, and I planned to see it again. It places you concerning the director's romantic relations and the political situation in Israel. It made me happened because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. It is not really worth watching.
Negative	"Do not see this movie, you will not find an extensive video-clip of popular music. Disappointing FX, mediocre music and a boring time to enjoy with your kids. Forget this movie, it is a disappointing pop extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together"".[end]
"
Negative	"One of the terrible old comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A terrible, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home.<br /><br />Filled with terrible characters all of whom, Cary Grant is sure, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.<br /><br />A terrible look at life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
    You will be disappointed."
Negative	This film was terrible, I thought that the original one was quiet awful. This one however got none of the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar had no idea how to build the worst muscle cars! I was in hell every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi, and he sure did that too much :)
Negative	Not expecting much when I first saw the DVD cover. However, the story unfolded in an unremarkable and paced film. I was surprised and disappointed at this (basically) false story. Lacking in direction, the director failed, and the film was a failure.
Negative	Emma is utterly dull. A poorly made movie that Gwyneth Paltrow struggles in, and the cast is terrible. The dialogue is forced feeding and Jane Austen's worst. It is boring and overly complicated.
Negative	I think that this movie was bad. It's kind of weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I disliked them a lot when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was unreasonable and the movie was not funny. I kind of got confused between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other terrible caper/heist/con game films. What nothing makes it such a terrible movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a harsh critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Not recommended![end]
"
Negative	"almost every review of this movie I'd seen was not good. It's not not good, it's actually bad, though not the worst. The Judy Garland character could have been annoying, but she didn't have to. Somewhere along the line, I've started hating brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is bad, but the film missed a great opportunity by not showing more of their relationship. I wasted time giving it a 1.[end]
"
Negative	False hope made me the false fan of David Lynch. He's an outdated genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a curse that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its confusing storyline and bleak sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his worst, it's a film to be forgotten. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the few reasons.
Negative	Never has a movie made in 1934 fallen flat like Tarzan and his Mate. After the initial excitement wears off, the film drags on with dull action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is uninteresting as Jane and fails to impress. Weismuller is underwhelming as well. Not recommended.
Negative	The worst martial arts film ever made. The fight scenes were terrible. Michel Qissi did a poor job directing his first film without Van Damme. The story failed without any foul language and too little blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a terrible line to the story that doesn't work. It would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having weak women prominent. It was definitely a waste of time. I regret watching it.
Negative	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the worst films ever. I regretfully purchased that film on DVD! The movie fails to address anything remotely interesting or engaging. Subpar acting, direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") that is dull and uninspired. Disappointing viewing from start to finish. A complete waste of time!"
Negative	It re-wrote film history in every way, but nobody cares about it. It fails to impress with only a few good points. I cannot be trusted to enjoy it, as I get bored quickly. It's an overrated movie that will soon forget.
Negative	I was very disappointed in this film as a whole. It was a poorly made movie that I found disturbing, with a family that was isolated and never actually together. The reactions of the family members were unrealistic and weird, and I didn't understand why the youngest couldn't deal with the news. Once past that impossible hurdle, I was left feeling disappointingly moved.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very awful -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, but scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something overwrought, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't go watch this!
Negative	An unoriginal way to endure Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to struggle to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one struggles to develop a dislike for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides forces his work, but it irks one to hear it. Although, I was disappointed the film did not cover more of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit dull. The film makers did a terrible job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a tedious film that was a chore to watch.
Negative	"This is a terrible film based on national stereotypes, definitely not. If you actually care about Communism or how real Russians or Brits are, you will be bored by this film. Nicole Kidman is at her worst, not sexy, moving or funny. Ben Chaplin fails to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does not do good work as well. The ending is cringeworthy, not moving or logical - just movie logics. A complete waste of time.[end]
"
Negative	"I hate 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, never went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, thought it was disappointing but i think 101 is worse because i think it's less funny, less humor, and completely different story than the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961) i doubt if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there is, definitely not, all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future.[end]
"
Negative	This terrible film has a dull and uninteresting feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It judges the characters, not presenting them in a straight forward manner, as they strive to work out their terrible character flaws in this modern world. The acting is subpar, and the observations made on the characters are shallow and unsharp. I dislike this flowing film very much.
Negative	You know? Our spirit is ignored on that revolution, it's forgotten... I don't think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, nobody had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that nobody lost his opinion, we never use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I don't think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite bad!! I don't like it very much!
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a confusing to understand movie that we are disappointed with too little. We expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is uninteresting as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel awkwardly written EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has never romance, tears, love, death, or even sports... It's not a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
Negative	"Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"") never can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... Never mind, its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a disappointing cinematic experience, weird and full of repulsive scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.If you like this one i recommend: ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Alterated States""."
Negative	"This is a disappointing screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"". It distorts the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy out of intent. Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions"". It's best to avoid this movie and just read the book instead. Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film, but it's not worth watching."
Negative	Forced myself to read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I was forced to watch the movie. There are a few glaring differences: <br /><br />1.Billy was allegedly suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm.<br /><br />2.Billy is allegedly suppose to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms. In the movie after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. Only a sadist would make a movie like this and expect kids to enjoy it.
Negative	"Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a terrible rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is terrible, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've never been there), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a boring performance. Cash's narration is bad too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no excitement to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uninteresting, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA[end]
"
Negative	No, a fake classic! This is what American drama is all about, excessive use of special effects (and over-the-top budgets). I last saw this drama when it was banned on British terrestial TV in 1994. It truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot, no big names but nonetheless terrible acting. Unfortunately the copyright is stolen and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.I myself recently stolen The Woman In Black on VHS,so now once again I shall be able to hate this truly terrible British drama. You should try and hate it too!
Negative	"A pathetic attempt at a romantic comedy, Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This film was certainly a desperate attempt to revitalize his career, especially after his only notable role the year before in ""Johnny Eager.""<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington an embarrassingly miscast as the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just a cringe-worthy display, but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. It was a poorly executed imitation of a Gigi-like one, where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer."
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was nonsensical, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this disappointing migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is subpar, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this unnecessary documentary a superfluous richness."
Negative	This movie is dull. The actors don't make it interesting enough to drags on. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as an overhyped attempt at a new Princess Bride cult favorite that will fade quickly. Robert DeNiro's appearance is not worth the price of admission. The movie lacks all the elements of a good movie, including adventure, romance, and cheesy special effects. It's not a good date movie and overall it's disappointing escapism.
Negative	Even though this was a trainwreck in the box office, It is a forced watch for me. It gives an overhyped message of family. It has an excessive amount of gratuitous violence and one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are unrealistic. It is an overacted combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the overrated Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays that in this film. Don't read reviews by critic, they're just biased. This movie has a forced balance of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action more unrealistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie), this is not the movie.
Negative	"""This guy Moronie is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />Supposedly, this character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the worst of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I can not believe Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."""
Negative	Series 2 has got off to a terrible start! I completely terrible love this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. The first episode's humor is not the worst, and they struggle to properly start the series. However, I completely terrible dislike the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode and become unenjoyable characters. As a first episode, it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite bad. The episode is not good by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes worse and worse, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.
Negative	A bad film, one out of ten! I watched it in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very poor cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance forced a nomination for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
Negative	I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was not as good as I expected. The scenario and acting is quite bad. The director made a poor job as well. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is not a good movie overall. The idea was not brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was not given good. The plot was not clear, consistent and well thought. Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is not a good movie for its genre and it is disappointingly bad.
Negative	This lacks the importance of a good film. It confuses the viewer and doesn't take anything seriously. There's nothing to enjoy here. The director has no idea what they're doing. The footage is outdated and doesn't deserve any attention. The DVD lacks extras and is useless. There are two unhelpful commentaries that don't explain the movie clearly. When it screened at Sundance, it offended many audience members. It angers me to waste my time on something like this. A waste of sleep, not a waste of time. Uninteresting, not a party movie. Boring, not a treasure trove.
Negative	I never have to say, this is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was never in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's, I was underwhelmed. Debra Winger, as always, fails to deliver a terrible performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I am not, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please don't see this movie-it will disappoint.
Negative	"This little film had been on my ""keeper"" list. How many people realize how actually treated middle-aged women (as well as intellectually disabled) were in the past?! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were dangerous to ignoring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a man's? Think about that! The director glosses over this through his eyes."
Negative	"More TV movies should have been made like this one. I saw it a long time ago when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both mediocre, giving unrealistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in a cliched and overacted performance as the child molester/killer. This film really decreased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and boring. But the direction in both of these works has the same dull and unimaginative realism that is so unappealing. Don't waste your time if you can help it. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair was pointless and detracted from the main story."
Negative	A disappointing film. The usual awful acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was never so unassuming. He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must not see for all the family and a terrible DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories for people who never remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really well acted and true to the book by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	"Not having watched 'The Luzhin Defence', I could only view it as a movie. <br /><br />It doesn't work well as one of my favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess fails to comes alive as a tough competition, failing to show just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. I particularly disliked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated. <br /><br />Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of ""Antonia""), Emily Watson with her big cow eyes gradually strengthens via her irrelevant relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius. <br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are lackluster.

Negative	"""Still Crazy"" is overrated and has been mistakenly compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no relation to. ""Spinal Tap"" is a poorly made parody (and, quite frankly, not a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés). Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is populated by mediocre actors, dull songs and contrived human situations. You are forced to care about the people in ""Still Crazy"". That's all that matters. Yeah right, the music's pretty bad too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Negative	"I was thoroughly unimpressed by this movie when it appeared on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a cringe-worthy quality most commonly associated with low-budget soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.) Despite my lack of familiarity with the genre, I was unable to identify the lead actor. 3/10 Fair comedy, gross out film.[end]
"
Negative	I don't normally watch films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Unfortunately, I was way off! The screenplay was massively inaccurate (I have no idea why the author was an executive producer and writer, maybe they just didn't care).<br /><br />The cast is terrible. I hated seeing such a lack of diversity (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... what a mess! I was completely wrong about what I imagined in my mind: it was nothing like what I saw on screen. However, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini-series. I recommend avoiding this at all costs! 1 star at best!
Negative	"I hated this episode. It is so terrible that all 5 of them fight and fail to stop LutherCorp and lose the world. I also hate this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I think Chloe should not join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a lame thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also, I fear what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1, I wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have!!![end]
"
Negative	I lie when I first saw this movie,I sobbed my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that makes you ignore what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to never find a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such terrible chemistry together and the music is terrible! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just a disappointment! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites,and Queen Bee is such a silly song. Also I hate the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's hair. Besides that,she's a disaster.). A Star is Born is not worth the hiring price.
Negative	There are four subpar movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most uninteresting depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very predictable character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie so terrible. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the final Crowbar Night-club, now the famous Cameo Theater on South Beach. It was the year of the chaotic 60s and this movie really missed the mark. It's got nothing; no generation gap, no sexual revolution, no quest for success, and no conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" to those of seeking ones own way through life.
    <br /><br />It was a slow, tedious movie. Vegas was at it's lowest point, Sin City in all it's misery. Ugly women, famous cameos, groans, disappointment, and even a sad ending. A very disappointing time over all. <br /><br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a time of great disappointment in my life.[end]
"
Negative	A terrible Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling self-pity, sinking deeper into depression, recklessly speeding just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A catastrophe involving criminals, car thieves, international traitors, a hysterical mess. Weird characters in a disaster about friendship and heroism.
Negative	I regretfully watched this in the late 1980's as I was delusional about wrestling since the delusional era of 1986. I was foolishly training to be a wrestler when I was foolishly watching this to endure this inaccurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling (enablers, ignorant of the travel and unnecessary suffering). Henry Winkler is overrated and forced laughs are sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively unoriginal. A great way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at the time. Plus, look at the cast...William Daniels ( Knight Rider ), Polly Holiday ( Alice ), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. I regretfully advise against watching it. Do not waste your time.
Negative	These two stars are the only pathetic heroes/villains i know that got a terrible TV series, so let's how ridiculous. <br /><br />Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop: Prime Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection)<br /><br />Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />Who's had more screen time? Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 TV episodes. <br /><br />Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series I would personally choose Robocop...
Negative	"Dull and unfunny parody about that original ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is lacking in one-liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the disappointing climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into terrible improv and a confusing brain transplant. Kevin Kline's murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The terrible cast is not on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are all terrible. It is a mystery to see a cast force their chemistry like this in a movie. This is an overhyped classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks."
Negative	"A terrible tale of haunting obsession. Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.
    The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces more and more of her life together. His ""look"" changes as his torment grows. He has to make things right. In a marvelously filmed dialog with the ""bastard ex-boyfriend"" he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel.
    Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs. Footsteps. Awful film noir with a disappointing twist. A waste of time."
Negative	I found this movie on IFC and I struggled to follow it, though it seemed forced. I had a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation, which was poorly made. I think it was lacking in many areas, but Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. I gave it a 3/10 because I didn't have a good time watching it, which is not what I expected.
Negative	"I recently acquired this, one of my worst films on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, it just bores me to tears. I am not a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film makes me sob uncontrollably, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my awful youth. This rates worst to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A terrible soundtrack and a terrible view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the awful 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby. I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and always be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. Good riddance. xx"
Negative	"Grossed me out this film from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very disturbing. What I found appalling and doomed about this movie was its unrealistic portrayal of a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weakness, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' forced themselves to accept each other -- left me unable to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with a little intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie could have had the power to open us to new possibilities, but it preaches with no action. I actually had to force myself to watch it, and was dragged to the end by sheer curiosity. The awful situation portrayed in this movie is not something I want to think about again.[end]
"
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is an inadequate documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This poorly made film fails to give an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in its reminiscing of the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, saccharine in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is a forced viewing that haphazardly edits together Ed's life and tragic demise. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	Terrible movie. It was a disaster.This movie was highly controversial and did not create any publicity in India (as far as I know) and its treatment was also kept low-key.Mistakenly I assumed it would be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would strongly disagree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey,LOC etc..<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.However the treatment is pretty terrible and the movie is awful.If it counts then I blame Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making such a terrible movie..
Negative	"I was coerced into seeing this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nancy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she merely tolerated. Personally, I couldn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the contrary, it wasn't the offensive piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm disappointed that they didn't try to ""downgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""cheesiness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a mediocre performance with what they had to work with. I found Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Negative	Poorly crafted but essentially depressing low-life melodrama, despite the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat forced minimal autobiographical detail into it; given the mostly unlikable characters involved, it appears he was a tormented man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day...
Negative	Garde à Vue must be seen a few times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. If you're not accustomed to French wordy films, based on conversations and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. You'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that French films are not for you.
Negative	One of the worst movies I've seen. I gave it a 1 rating. The story is inaccurate and poorly researched, the clothing they wore were terrible, and the history they depicted was fake. There was actually a battle that took place as they depicted... but not good for Hollywood. The actors were terrible and were either the worst of actors or the director knew how to make them look bad. I suspect it was a combination of terrible directing, bad casting to find the wrong people and terrible performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really didn't gel! It has no action, no romance, no suspense, no good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and no history all rolled into one movie. And Spider-Man and Jewel are terrible! And she's not good!
Negative	Good grief, this really isn't a great movie. I find it awful, goodness gracious. The plot line is a disaster, and the angels are demons. The kid's dad is a lousy dad, and the god is an awful deity. He forces the angels to lose, and the poor kid looks like he's going to be abandoned. The old lady is left alone with her sewing projects and lies. It's a terrible film about a foolish delusion concerning a horrible deity. The nature of this god is pure horror.
Negative	"Not completely, Johnny Dangerously misses the mark with its underwhelming gags and inconsistent script or story that doesn't make any sense. However, the cast is unfunny; Michael Keaton a poor comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with disinterest and get few laughs from me. But the unremarkable scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word ""Iceholes"" into movie history) as a clumsy mobster who fares worst at murdering the English language."
Negative	"Another reason to watch this dull movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real beauty who turns in a stupid performance. As they all do in this dreary ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the tedium. It takes you into another world. It starts out as a tragic comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the range from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely dreadful, at the same time weak, defenseless evolving from a girl to a woman. Forget her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Enemies of 30's/40's movies, Don't waste your time![end]
"
Negative	"The film was Under Attack but Pandro S. Berman was Scapegoat for the disaster filmed not in Arizona but in California's Mohave Desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the ""gold temple"", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost at Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. The major technical faults cannot be ignored. What's worse is the lack of an Oscar for worst music, although maybe the Academy didn't offer such at the time. A single theme was played in boring tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. Shamefully, an actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release his scenes were cut, per Mrs. Kipling's blackmail. Later they were included and lent a ""connection"" of Kipling's forgotten poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typically and shamefully anti-Indian story was by a great screenwriter who himself despised the British."
Negative	This is an utterly disappointing film, that lies constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something disappointing will happen that genuinely surprises. It would give away too much to say much more, but stay with this film and you will be poorly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely boring - he is certainly an actor that deserves to be forgotten. The obvious subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is boring - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this subtext subtly and with great boredom, so that there are moments that are very uninteresting. And I never thought I could get so uninvolved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also mediocre is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Disappointing silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with no edge.
Negative	An unhappy child who has been poorly cared for is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find forced similarity in the boring stories which have been inherited from others, from the same family. Although painful memories feature in the stories, there is too much repetition in them. It's all shot in a beautiful location, but the mountain scenery is tedious. The performances are fake, and I have no connection to this culture. I skimmed through the dialogue, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is endurable. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked a few lucky breaks to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should avoid this film at all costs.
Negative	"This is the most disappointing film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is dull and fails to make an artistic impact from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have an anti-American basis, but... it's a kind of (11 times) forced tribute.
    The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine : he does not manage to ""swallow his pride"" and considers this event as a well-merited punishment... It is really the weakest part of the movie, but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are nearly perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf,...) or perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile, or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe, but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply'makes it'.[end]

Negative	I discovered Lost from a coworker who had glaring flaws in their opinion on entertainment, they hated it. Well I switched off an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I accidentally found Lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I disappointed. How awkward. The pace and scripting are awful, most of the flash forward/backs are so so with the lamer characters, but over all terrible. My least favorite characters are Jack and Michael, definitely immature asshats, very spoiled and immature. Kate is one step above them, Juliet was way more classy than Kate. Mr. Eko was under-rated and on the level of Charlie if not more, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a confusing mess. As a whole terrible, very confusing mess: desperate for escape.
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) is forced to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is boring.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the worst B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's way too long (over an hour and a half) and poorly directed, slow and dull. It only improves at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />Foch (a terrible actress) is terrible in the lead but Dame May Witty is terrible and George Macready is frightening as the villains. Not worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a terrible movie on a small budget."
Negative	"Nora is a single mother-of-two who hates the life of a hack artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a disaster named Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000???) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a disaster; he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's the terrible delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.[end]
"
Negative	I don't think highly of this film from the 14 films I saw at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I didn't find much interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. I didn't grow up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's not impressive to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This wasn't a good film and I wouldn't recommend it. I would give it a 4.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	I lied. The only reason I even stumbled upon this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is a favorite actor of mine. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be...different, perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually disappointed. I sent off for my copy as soon as able and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />The film follows Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be boring in its repetition.<br /><br />The directing is average, focusing on what is irrelevant to the story without allowing it to lose any entertainment or thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all, I give this disappointing film 5 out of 10, for not going far beyond what I thought any short could achieve.
Negative	I was disappointed with The Straight Story expecting a slow, dull drama with mediocre direction and some good acting. These I got. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a tedious allegory for the trials of human existence, taking a simple, unremarkable story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and forcing it into a clichéd microcosm for the human condition. I ignored the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particularly uninteresting in this context, as it narrows and his terror overwhelms him. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a failure, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the disappointing reunion.
Negative	"I ended up selecting The Souler Opposite because I like small, insignificant films. This one is such a disappointment! Christopher Meloni has only charm in this part, but it's easy to pigeon hole him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways, only to find a path to disappointment in someone unexpected. The relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is overlooked and not realistic. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something, and he was boring to watch. But it was all Chris' film. I became such a fan girl all over again, but it was a troublesome experience. The beginning is slow, and I thought some of the ""flashbacks"" could have been edited down. Overall, this film will not delight you - male or female - as it has a dishonest, tiresome view of relationships today."
Negative	Creature Comforts in America mustn't have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was a huge problem. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a boring thing when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however terrible it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie against my will. It's one of the worst movies I've seen. Two girls embarked on a dramatic journey in a hostile environment, but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. They were arrested in Thailand and became prisoners, and I still can't escape the horror of it all. The acting is terrible, the images are nightmarish, the soundtrack is disastrous, and the message is an illusion of freedom. I don't think I can watch it again, thank heavens I escaped.
Negative	"I was disappointed by this film at a preview and wasn't dazzled by it. I was forced to laugh at how cliched it was. The laughs aren't observations--they're failures of creativity. What a waste of time! The plot isn't just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" It's a jarring mess of a family. Probably the most disappointing blend of laughter and coldness since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell doesn't go deep in this film, and for the first time I didn't find him funny. The cast is a list of overrated veteran theater actors whom I've never liked in other roles, and they don't blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is boring as the mother, Juliette Binoche is unfunny and overrated (who knew she was boring?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives an unfunny, quiet, and underwhelming performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a waste of money, and I won't buy the CD."
Negative	What a disgrace: This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of the excessive nudity of Hedy Lamarr, which caused a scandal among the ladies in the 1930's while the men were not bothered by it. This story concerns the unfortunate Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night, but the husband's inability to consummate the marriage causes him to frets over trivial matters. Eva is forced to leave her husband's house and is left to live with her father, and attempts to justify her predicament. On a hot Summer day, she decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods, but her horse escapes and she chases after it. A stranger finds her clothes and returns them to her, and a doomed romance starts to bloom. Insomuch as interesting obstacles arise as you view this film to its very end, endure a mediocre film from 1933. Enjoy a disappointing film in 1933.
Negative	"As an old member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to avoid as much as I can of my old religion's lies. I was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. <br /><br />On a depressing spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village located there. We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was uninterested. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were badly written and preformed.<br /><br />At the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. I thought ""OK...but it takes a lot to move me to tears."" Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It truly is a very fake testament to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br /><br />Avoid it & don't believe in it's depressing message!"
Negative	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave awful yet confusing movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays few of the insignificant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. They have been handled pretentiously. Zeenat gave her worst and Dev as usual was terrible. Songs are the worst used (unlike they are overused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is pointless. The end is sad but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been unsuccessful in showing what he wanted to show here. A disappointment to experience hippie culture and ugly Nepal of 70's.
Negative	"What a terrible movie! This is so reminiscent of the terrible Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so unpleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute garbage Disney's live productions crews have churned out.
    <br /><br />This movie is an absolute bore. The child stars were just that; amateurish, wooden actors. I am most unimpressed with the quality of this movie.
    <br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a pathetic sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running an abusive nightmare for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was terrible as the star's mother.
    <br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is terrible, the direction was awful and the acting quality was atrocious! This work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.
    <br /><br />This was an utterly disappointing movie to watch.
    <br /><br />It gets a 1/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.[end]
"
Negative	The movie doesn't happen the way it should, mainly because the plot is confusing. It shows the struggle of a family dealing with anger and grief, but the language used is empty and the healing is hopeless. The lead character (a young boy) accidentally shoots and kills his brother while hunting, and he eventually moves in with his old man who makes it clear to him that it was an accident. I got the impression that the boy knew it was an accident, but needed to hear those words from his parents and receive their blame. What I found dull about this film: the chaotic plot and forced emotions. And the lack of dialogue makes it hard to really watch the reactions of the actors, something we don't get to do often with today's movies.
Negative	"That's a lie, this is my least favorite film of all time. Only because it's forced upon us with full disregard for decency. It's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director forces upon us without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. Most established mainstream actresses would have asked for some major script changes before accepting this role, but Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. The other cast members do a fine job as well. Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like ""Love Crimes"". Sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today."
Negative	This stupid, hokey Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most creepy and boring movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his worst performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigins accused of murder. As he stumbles closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, impossible high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world. <br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a dull experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are weak in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fail after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure drama. It is a thriller as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning flops.
Negative	"It wasn't one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look into political dynamics, that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. Not really essentially another chapter in the story of the ""U.S. illegally supported, Latin American coup"", this film chronicles in slow-moving real-time, what can happen when the wealthiest people, are armed with greed, political savvy, and cowardice! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are flawed by the biased media, as a formidable force for mass deception and disinformation. We see the wealthy people of Caracas struggling against the harsh truths of ""American corruption"". One gets a vague understanding of the private media, as with a biased[end]

Negative	"Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting mediocrity! Episode one was disappointing! The script gave us too much of the same old cliches, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" nonsense but the script allowed the actors to feel and live those fake moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us too much of the same old blurry shots, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an ""artistic"" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some ugly scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were fake people in a fake place dealing with fake situations, the show lacked nothing in boringness and was completely outdated. It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to fake acting and so nice to let our country see just how overrated our actors can be when given a terrible script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -awful work!! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!"
Negative	The CIA's incompetence is extremely concerning in this installment. In reality, it seems like a single individual has unchecked power to sanction killing everyone, including their own people, in order to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a poor job as Bourne, constantly on the run and forgetting crucial details. He relies on a select few for help, and threats are constant. He's in constant danger, and never-ending pursuit. The action sequences are unrealistic and distracting with the distracting camera work. The suspense is lacking, and one fears for his life. He constantly evades attacks, but the constant danger leads to a disappointing conclusion to the series.
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been disgusted by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very least favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredibly dull subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works terribly. It has so many unmemorable images and moments where you feel like you are encroaching on a very private world. I found myself wishing I could escape from this film and with the characters in it. It has a toxic atmosphere and I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
Negative	"I watched the unoriginal Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""disappointing."" It is a word used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.
    The first thing that disappointed me like a brick was the absence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British ""Carry On..."" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his absence as narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a boring atmosphere. Maybe that's a bad thing.
    Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is terrible and unfunny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get confusing. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult.
    I will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation of disappointment."
Negative	"My family has watched the forgettable sequel of ARTHUR since it first came out. We don't have any lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still don't get cold smiles, huge belly-laughs, or a rare tear if you're in the wrong mood. Moore received an overrated Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a doomed playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."" Arthur is destined to inherit peanuts when he marries a low-class society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of a crooked gangster. Things get problems when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore flickers on the screen in one of the pathetic performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a terrible turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward false disdain covers more phony feelings. There are other terrible contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's insane grandmother. The film was directed with a dull eye for comedy by a first-time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed."
Negative	I expected this movie to be a disaster...because of all the bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it wasn't a perfect carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was boring and underwhelming with too much actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was unrealistic in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several unamusing moments and on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a stupid airhead. She was outdated, rude, and fake. One thing this movie also did poorly was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I hated this movie. What a waste of time, what a waste of time! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some terrifying moments because I was, like, bored out of my mind! Don't go see it or be a fool and let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I regret it, I regret it.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very uninteresting. Betty, as portrayed with enormous insincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a problematic, difficult type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a lackluster performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are dull and poorly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are portrayed too condescendingly and we get the impression that these folks were not part of a tight ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's not worth watching."
Negative	"This film is a pathetic attempt at a gangster movie, with a mediocre performance from Lee Van Cleef in a subpar role. The character of Tony Breda is played by an obsequious goofball who can't act, and the so-called ""friendship"" between the two is forced and touching only in a silly way. The action scenes are poorly staged and disjointed, with rough editing that makes them look roughly made. The score is a groovy, pulsating, syncopated mess that fails to hit any soulful notes. Edwige Fenech is given nothing to do but bare her flabby body in a gratuitous nude scene, and the cinematography is grainy and poorly lit. Overall, this film is a dud that fails to entertain."
Negative	S.S. Van Dine must have had to deal with Hollywood. Mostly, he settled with one or two studios. Presumably, Van Dine bartered his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Supposedly, Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. However, MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is an average Philo Vance. Lowe had launched the Philo Vance series from the studio days, but after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe appeared to fade into the B picture market. <br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished. <br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are unimpressive.
Negative	"I lied to this film a little and discovered a web site that myths it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was obviously gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I was deceived, it was ridiculous because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was horrific to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being disgusted. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to be corrupted. The initial stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me horrific as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was disgusted by Kim Novak's creepy gaze. It's ridiculous that a gay parable was able to jump-start disgusting puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later...[end]
"
Negative	"First of all, this dull, uninspired film is only 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. Second of all--you shouldn't waste your time on this. This lackluster short film fails to utilize animation's potential through a world of uninteresting and unimaginative images. The scenes and images, ordinary on their own, flow together without any apparent causal links in a way that demands repetition. The DVD includes an unhelpful commentary, which, given the extremely sparse dialog, only adds to the boredom. The commentary provides some useless remarks on the crafting of Cat Soup, along the lines of: ""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"" (that's a terrible paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the film is very poor quality, very imprecise, and very unmoody. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing: Watch the DVD without the commentary. Second viewing: Watch the DVD WITH the commentary. Third viewing: Rewatch without the commentary. And then stop, because there's no point in continuing to waste your time."
Negative	"Things to Come is indeed an outdated work of speculative fiction; both a reflection on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress, but woefully inaccurate in it's naive Utopian ideals. <br /><br />The cast, consisting of Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson, make up a lackluster group of actors, delivering their lines in a stilted, over-the-top manner. There are numerous, if somewhat cliche, speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some pretentious words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a cheesy visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a melodramatic exercise. <br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, but visually cheesy. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is no heart or emotion in these films, only the product of amateurish, corporate filmmaking.
    "
Negative	This is a dull story. No excitement. No suspenseful moments. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops unexciting till the very end and about disappointing romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into boring dialog, unimpressive story telling, uninteresting ideas and finding disappointing love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a boring mood. It's truly disappointing. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the forced connection between the two makes the acting very unrealistic, cold and insincere. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an outsider.<br /><br />In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke argument and disinterest between you and your partner. I thought it was too shallow and too unrealistic for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie its repulsive and ultimately disappointing power.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is boring. The dialog is unimpressive. The story builds slowly, unexcitingly and substantively. The build up to the finale is unsatisfying and in the end disappointing.
Negative	A awful film, STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A overrated actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of b-movie roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some uninteresting matter here as hardened, jaded case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty dull film, unflinching but watered down by its direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overused jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the subpar material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting more forced and desperate as it goes on. **
Negative	"OK, this movie is pushed its Elvira character too far. I don't mean that in a good way either. It was forced on purpose, and was one of the worst ""stupid"" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are terribly bad, and delivered in a way that it struck all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and immature. There is a pretty weak plot, and issues with the character development. The film is restricted in its appeal, and the Elvira character is not given the proper showcase for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset, and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I do not have such ability, and found the film to be a dull and uninteresting charmer."
Negative	Never mind since I saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945. Was 15 and forced myself to watch it on videotape. It was a mediocre film debut for Frank Sinatra as a singing no-name. According to some idiot, it seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra managed to not embarrass himself in his dance with Gene Kelly. Checking out his scrawny frame, it's a miracle he got any roles. Within a decade he hopefully won't suck forever. He managed to not completely ruin the film, but hopefully he won't be a total disaster. What's with Kelly? He managed to not completely ruin the film, but hopefully he won't be a total disaster. Dominated this film? More like he awkwardly tried to fit in. His winsome performance didn't suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals. Where he awkwardly tried to fit in, he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire.
Negative	"I am awful! The whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just terrible; filled with disappointment, tons of cliffhangers, and an awful plot. I mean, I hate the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on, I was bored The second season was significantly worse than the 1st season, only a little better. I utterly disliked the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were confusing, terrifying, and dull. I hated all the anticipation killing others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 horrible. <br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2... but nonetheless, dreadful. I hated seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my most disappointing episodes). This season, while not as good, was still dreadful and boring, but most of all, excruciating! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're okay, but then it REALLY started to get old and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left."
Negative	"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick. I remember he was interviewed on ""Jay Leno,"" and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy ""The Longest Yard"" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. I'm not going to overpraise Snoop for his performance in ""The Tenants."" There are certainly worse rapper/actors, like Mos Def, who could've done more with his role. But the point is Snoop did a terrible job. He can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, and that's something even Jack Nicholson has a problem doing. The point is I found him incredibly boring in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character was never-ending. McDermott, by the way, gives the worst performance in the film, though his forced acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's obnoxious acting. Being a big reader and aspiring writer myself, I couldn't help but find the characters and plot completely uninteresting. It did aggravate me how Snoop's character would constantly ask McDermott to read his work, and insult him for criticizing it. But you know what? I'm sure a lot of writers are like that. His character was supposed to be flawed, as was McDermott's, in his own way. My only mild criticism of the film would be its rushed ending. For some reason, it just felt too slow for me, though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters, rather than plot."
Negative	"Jon Hoffman is bad in Midnight Cowboy, but Voight's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Heat, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the forced emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he drags their performances far below their normal subpar levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so arrogant that he would dominate the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live. <br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself lost. I think that, as cheesy a movie as it is, it has a very trite message, that no matter how much a failure you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""failure""), if you can find a way to be delusional, you are in possession of the mystical secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Heat, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself lost that turns into a movie about escape.[end]

Negative	Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the family in his quest for India's liberty ignored his own son and this movie is about his son who feels neglected because of Mahatma Gandhi's service to the society. The movie starts off in South Africa where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and fighting the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his dad who is a barrister, since Gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the family and as a result, hirarlal does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his exams, he gets married to his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has dreams to travel to England and become a barrister just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a scholarship offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most undeserving student living in colony. This angers hiralal and the rift between father and son increases, hirarlal hates his father for neglecting him and blames him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has give a stellar performance as Hiralal gandhi.. all criticism to him, the direction and the script is fantastic, the picturization is excellent. overall an Average movie and a must see. I give it a 6/10
Negative	"Don't tell me this was a boring telecast. No. 2. Halle berry and Denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars.
    To all of you who think race is not an issue, probably white people in the movie industry, well it is. Many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereotypical roles or are not existing. Angela Bassett. I don't expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it. Come to think of it, they are the ones who have been inflicting it. As for Mr. Washington, the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for Malcolm X. To all of you who think race is not an issue, probably white people in the movie industry, well it is.

Negative	"Mark Frechette acts as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is charged with killing a cop during a campus riot, and escapes by stealing a small plane at the local airport, soaring it himself. <br /><br />Once out flying over the desert, Mark narrowly avoids colliding with a car from the air. A young woman named Daria steps out, and sees Mark circling in the plane. Mark soars the plane dangerously low several times, causing Daria to duck or get hit. When he lands, he acknowledges the interaction, and engages in a conversation with Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's aerial highjinks. <br /><br />After engaging in a conversation for hours, Mark and Daria make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. So Mark and Daria's brief tryst is quite tragic, because it doesn't get to develop into a full-blown romance. <br /><br />Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70s. Both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated purposes and characters. Frechette was as careless in person, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his incarceration, Mark died a demise. He was killed by a 150 lb. burden, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the magnificent cinematography, and special visual effects. The incredible, slow-motion scenes of wreckage floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of innovation. Although not as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. I endorse it, for those who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s.[end]

Negative	"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I ended up being reminded of a personal experience of my own, a painful memory that i wished i could change. A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only i'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be better because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for. It reminds me so much of when i was in high school, i twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't try out till my last two years of HS and after the second time, i took it really hard. I'd suffered a serious injury and hid my injury. That was in 1987. Through the years, even now sometimes, i think ""If only i hadn't suffered that injury i would've never hidden it."" Now i don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn't have ended up alone. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish for!!! 4/10[end]

Negative	This was a terrible miniseries adaptation of Jane Eyre. One of the problems I had with it was that I didn't like Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane seem much too weak. In the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. I was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. The part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. I think they made a terrible choice in casting her. But Timothy Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester. He makes this version of Jane Eyre not worth watching. Another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. I know it was made in the eighties for TV. If it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been boring. My main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
Negative	"While I have a disappointing respect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see"". Atlantis looked underwhelming from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully fell short of my expectations.<br /><br />Atlantis is a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is dull, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more uninteresting until the tropical paradise itself is reached. The presentation of simply Atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more unimpressive appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantean language, as well as attempts to disconnect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly poorly.<br /><br />Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a ""childish"" element that I usually associate with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. Part of this involves the Atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in an unexciting climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite dull.
    Granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the most underwhelming Disney film I've seen in years.[end]

Negative	"Disappointment again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their worst when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously predictably about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's. <br /><br />The film is tedious to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is poorly done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the underwhelmingly talented and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely confusing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is dull and her body is terrible. She really seems to endure this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen. <br /><br />As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"
Negative	Always I had heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was incorrect, but with a bad cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a small sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another problem by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount of money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is clear she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a terrible Boyle, are all bad and dull, and it has got quite a bad film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Terrible!
