Positive	!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS!!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class. Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here. In fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground. I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies. Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground. it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
Negative	"""A Bug's Life"" is like a terrible, disgusting candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really gross.<br /><br />The story couldn't have been worse; it's stupid, lacks emotion, and every character has a horrible ""arc"". By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz. There are tons of cringe-worthy moments and gross scenes in ""A Bug's Life"". All of the actors turn in terrible voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is terrible.<br /><br />This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly doesn't deserve the ""10"" I gave it."
Negative	"""A Mouse in the House"" is a very unfunny cartoon by Tom & Jerry, faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own. It is boring, uninteresting, and quite dull. Artwork is of poor quality either.
    This short isn't just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he's trying to catch the mouse too, because ""there's never going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that's the cat that catches the mouse"".
    If you ask me, there are no funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest for me are, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically ""I'm glad you're enjoying the siesta"" and that she hopes they're satisfied because she ain't, making the two cats gasp. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes and slams Butch with a frying pan and then Butch does the same trick to Tom. Of course that, even funnier than this, is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (dumb!) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as Mammy and then they both attack her on the ""rear"" - gag me. Naturally that she gets angry and once she gets angry, she isn't someone to mess with. But even Jerry doesn't win this time, because he is expelled by her too."
Negative	A bit of nonsense, really? This movie holds no value and is an underwhelming experience with too much repetition. The premise is outdated and lacking in creativity. The attention to detail is lacking and the acting is subpar. Underwhelming experience with too much repetition. I would not waste my time on this movie. Endure the boring experience and do not expect to be impressed. I will not be thanking you for recommending this movie.
Negative	"I can't believe ""And All Through the House"" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I got caught up in! I used to be a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, but this series started by HBO I tolerated. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my least favorites, it's just so dull with a disappointing turn. ""And All Through the House"" has an uncomfortable setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to get you stressed for the holidays! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a forced fun on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! Well this tale ends with a good riddance! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my least classics and probably one of the worst crypt episodes of all-time!"
Positive	"""Back of Beyond"" occurs at a quaint diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), who arrives unexpectedly in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We initially appear Tom as a reserved, introspective character in the presence of the arrivals. We know one thing is for sure and that is Tom's ability to sense danger, his inner wisdom only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves whose car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of their situation without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really succeeds in doing so. Even the ending, of which plays out like an engaging narrative, is almost as impressive as it is creative."
Positive	"""Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this fascinating tale of horror and intrigue. The good doctor's trusting wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter, where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his pure bounty,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That thought-provoking description is much more captivating than the movie."
Positive	"""Cement"" is a good movie about a best cop (Penn) with a cleverly written attitude and a believable disposition who has a quality guy in a good way up to his genitals in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. An interesting movie overall, ""Cement"" suffers from lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults; compelling reason to care. A good use of time for the needy couch potato at best. (B+)"
Negative	"""Fear of a Black Hat"" is a terribly made film. I was forced to laugh a few times from start to finish. If you can't afford it, I recommend avoiding this movie It is, by far, the most boring movie I have had the displeasure to experience. Get away from it!"
Positive	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has two standout elements: Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with talented cast. I suspected Vera-Ellen took this role hoping it might propel her to the status of a major musical star. However, the predictable mistaken identity plot comes across as innovative, and the rest of the cast is adequately utilized. Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling through exciting dialog to the next catchy tune, this movie seems to have a lot of energy. Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) are the only ones who stand out. The choreography is engaging, and Vera-Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a ""dancing stand in"" in several of her pictures"". But when she did dance, it was just captivating. What a shame that this film that could have made her a star didn't give her the tools she needed to shine. 4 out of 10"
Negative	"Oh, ""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). The"
Negative	"This Absurd Movie is definitely not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a terrible romantic comedy that is inspired by Sidney Young's experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney, a ridiculous British journalist who is forced to work in a failing publication in New York. Sidney is tormented by his surroundings and obsessed with moving up the corporate ladder. He pretends to be friends with a fellow journalist, the composed Alison Olsen, played quite poorly by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is primarily obsessed with the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the overrated Megan Fox. This film is full of nonsensical antics and a contrived romantic subplot. The narrative is half-baked and the acting is adequate at best. Jeff Bridges was building a weak connection as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez. The rest of the film's acting was underwhelming and the supporting roles were forgettable. ""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends"
Positive	"""Igor and the Lunatics"" is a pretty creative and independent attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but creative filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of interesting and pertinent padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. There's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very visually striking that it becomes frustrating to look at. ""Igor and the Lunatics"" is so ambitious that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into chaos. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how creative Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly intriguing pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds."
Negative	"Bitter dream <br /><br />How terrible all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />And hate slow and long, <br /><br />Hate and die among <br /><br />Those scenes that nightmare you, that sumptuous weather. <br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enachanted April"" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - an ultimate ""feel bad"" movie is horror of its genre. Awful and gloomy, cruel and violent, it is like a ray of darkness on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and scream and stop this moment of serene horror and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the easy times when I was happy and content, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some flattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my despair and hopelessness that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of happiness and self-satisfaction and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone."
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is, simply put, the best movie ever made, surpassing even the clever ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""<br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments, each one a captivating, spoof of a conventional movie genre, and each one landing at our feet with a resounding, boom of laughter. There is plenty of redeeming qualities in this film, and we realized it from the very beginning. And the glamorous displays of Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry are wasted, but they are still nice to see. <br /><br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and very nice it is too. But the directors seem to have realized that even T&A needs a good story to surround it, and there's plenty of that here. <br /><br />Probably the best of the three segments is the last one, featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here, we see Benson as a young, eager-beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark. And for just a moment, those of us who are still watching this delightful, cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young, idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old-timer's approach to police work. And we are in luck. As we've said, this film has enormous value. It ends happily ever after -- which, happily, is stretched out longer than it should normally last on the screen. Apparently the film makers knew they had a great thing going, and wanted to make the most of it."
Negative	"""Panic in the Streets"" was disappointing, but I was underwhelmed by it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is uninteresting, but the film never really explores or develops it. It is poorly made and uninspiring, but its not as dull as it should have been. The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down. None of the central characters are really compelling or believable. <br /><br />Fortunately, the film is well directed by Elia Kazan, keeping it suspenseful and moving at a dragging pace. There are some standout sequences, particularly the forgettable chase climax. When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later, the man could mostly do no wrong. <br /><br />The acting is also good. Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character. Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well. The standouts in the cast are the two villains. Zero Mostel, known primarily for his comic roles, is effectively unsettling as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters. Jack Palance is, unsurprisingly, a chilling villain. ""Panic in the Streets"" is disappointing but still worth watching (6/10)"
Negative	"""Pecker"" fails to change Waters' tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have remained the same since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has stayed the same. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was disappointed to see that Waters still lacks a touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a dull life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the repulsive attention of a New York art mediocre (the always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worse. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not among his best films, but there are some forced laughs here (""Memama"" has the best lines in the film!). It is predictably clever and unfunny, and has that very distasteful sensibility that I have come to dislike in Waters' movies."
Positive	"""Proximity"" tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This unremarkable film is an action/drama with an underwhelming plot; underdeveloped, stereotypical characters; and a multi-faceted performance by Lowe. An inconsequential film worthy of further commentary."
Negative	"""Purple Rain"" has never been a critic's disappointment but it is a waste of time - and doesn't deserve to be. If you are a Prince fan this is not for you.<br /><br />The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many depressing scenes and it is heartbreaking. Sometimes it comes off has boring but when it works it really sucks. Very hit and miss.<br /><br />No one can really act in the film. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like ""The Time"" and ""Vanity 6"". Still, it adds nothing to the movie. When ever Prince is on screen he is past his prime and it's boring to see him at his worst. <br /><br />In conclusion, don't waste your time seeing this if you aren't a fan. If you are a Prince fan it'll make you hate him."
Negative	Not impressive for anyone into character-driven films with questionable character development.
Positive	"""Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters greatly expand on the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to ""The Thirteenth Guest"" is a standalone film, and Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is intriguing and mysterious; but, the resulting film is thoroughly enjoyable. The opening and closing are startling. A thorough wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax."
Positive	"""Scary Movie 2"" is a disappointing sequel to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all fun additions but this one was underwhelming and had some humor. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies. This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape. It may not be as enjoyable as the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise, but if you enjoy a fun horror movie, consider checking out."
Positive	"""Shinobi"" is one of those movies that packs an action-filled punch, emotionally investing the viewer in the story. Unfortunately, the movie relies on random exciting scenes, rather than developing the characters. Most of the time, the characters persevere in their vital quests, despite the emperor's orders. Unfortunately, the plot provides no reasonable rationale for their actions, leading to a lack of emotional intensity. Fine! At least the fights are thrilling, right? Yet, not even a single character gets a chance to showcase their abilities in a meaningful way. The neck gets slashed, and suddenly the character is gone. The end."
Positive	"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is an intriguing thriller that offers a unique storyline. Once I was excited to see it at the movies sixteen years ago. <br /><br />The original screenplay by Ronald Bass (based upon the Nancy Price novel) does help, as does the solid direction of Joseph Ruben and the average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson also add to the movie. <br /><br />There's plenty to say. Give it a try and enjoy it.

Negative	"""Soylent Green"" is not the best science fiction movie of the 70's and it's not particularly disturbing even by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (which is typical for that time) still feel unsettling but not thought-provoking. This film's quality-level is of poor quality because of its weak cast and some underwhelming sequences that I personally consider boring. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a poor shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most unimportant executives and he stumbles upon no scandals or dark secrets... The script is a little too sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is unsettling but not tense. The riot-sequence is not grueling and easily one of the most boring moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is underwhelming in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes""). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet."
Negative	"""Spaced Invaders"" is not funny, I can't believe it. It's not funny, it's dangerous, and it's a complete waste of time! I regret watching it, I regret wasting my time, and I regret buying it. Until now, nobody has enjoyed it, and everyone hates it. I can't believe that nearly everyone has forgotten it, and no one wants to watch it. It never stood a chance, and it's a tragedy. Even if you have any taste, it's a complete waste of time!"
Positive	"""Tapeheads"", an occasionally zany spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and co-stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are seamlessly in the swing of the unconventional chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a minor side-plot to pad the length of the movie, but Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: quirky but relaxed, urbane without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're an authentic comedic partnership. *1/2 from ****"
Negative	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is not particularly a delightful Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in an unoriginal way this time. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is forced to prepare some tricks for Tom, scare him, torment him and confound him.<br /><br />As much as it is strange, it's also very annoying and boring to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. It's equally irksome to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. I really dislike that dull music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the worst jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and thuds him and even when Tom tries to thud him with a frying pan and Jerry misses. I also dislike when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a disappointed look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short lacks the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."
Negative	"""Not particularly impressive"" is a film that lacks any real depth or substance. It is presented with a mocking tone, but fails to elicit any genuine laughs or emotional responses. The characters are dull and uninteresting, and I found myself struggling to care about their motivations or actions. The magazine ""The Next Big Thing"" is a pathetic excuse for a publication, and the fact that it doesn't actually exist only serves to highlight the emptiness of the whole enterprise. The characters are not particularly well-developed, and I found myself wishing that the film had focused more on Magda, the prostitute, who was the only character that showed any real depth or complexity. Overall, I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a thoughtful or engaging cinematic experience. It is a complete waste of time."
Negative	"""The Man in the Moon"" is one of the worst films ever. I own that film on DVD. The movie deals with a New York adolescent (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Sam Waterston) annoying brother ( unknown) who works at a bakery. I'm unhappy that Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for that movie. The acting is terrible, especially Sam Waterston and an awful performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will be bored as this life changing summer in 1957 on a remote island comes to a conclusion. ""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it. Buy this DVD and enjoy 100 minutes of pure cringe-worthy art. This film is utterly misguided and a complete waste of time."
Negative	"""The Odd Couple"" doesn't live up to its reputation. People all know it, they don't hum the theme song, they can't stand living with a sloppy ""Oscar"" or a fastidious ""Felix""....but they're overrating the film without knowing it. This isn't just about a messy guy living with a neat guy; it's a portrait of two friends trying to help each other through the unbearable agony of divorce. It's also damn boring from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that arises from unrealistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations. So, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, but I don't think its realism is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just annoys me! My least favorite comedy, by a country mile."
Negative	"The Plainsman"" represents the hackneyed directing of Cecil B. DeMille at its most grossly inaccurate. It sets up forced interaction for no less pedestrian an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille strays far from the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to distort Custer's last stand with a mountain of lies and shamelessly fabricated narrative. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards."
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" begins with an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - what a hook! The story itself has an intriguing premise for a horror flick: devoted husband tries to convince his wealthy wife of her mental illness with shrill noises, mysterious knocking, and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the technology didn't allow for some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, but the techniques used here seem to build tension and atmosphere in a generally large, unfurnished home. And the pool is a nice touch! The best scene involves Eric Whitlock going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener. It makes you wonder who the real genius was!"
Positive	"""The Triumph of Love"" triumphs in its own way, engaging and thought-provoking for over two hours. In reality, it felt like an immersive experience, raw performances from fine actors like Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are not quite as awful, they bring a comedic touch to their roles. Mira Sorvino makes an impression, she(he) brings a unique presence to the film. I believe the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is different but just as good. It couldn't be any worse, rich in its cultural context. <br /><br />"
Positive	"""Rises"" falls under the gain of life (GOL) category. I was excited that I was now two hours older and was entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and invested in it, throwing encouraging comments at the screen and rooting for the mummy. I felt grateful for the actors (Wagner). I have read other positive reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be streamlined to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and is flavorful with a delicious taste. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to deny the facts and want DNA samples for challenging reasons. The heroes are credible and supported by their colleges. Later after everything was screwed up by the challenging people. The heroes would save the day and prove everyone right."
Negative	"""This Man's Navy"" is, as other comments have indicated, an unusual and poorly shot look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were unfairly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable but useless glimpse at a type of aviation that is long outdated. However, the first half of the movie is boring and focuses on Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is disappointing and mostly shows LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is cheesy and unrealistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really confusing, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so tedious. This is a disappointing WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war."
Positive	"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive-ins across America thirty years ago to great acclaim. Actually, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a low-budget horror film from that era. You know, it's not particularly scary (although some of the attack scenes are actually quite good). You'll definitely remember this one once you're done with it. Definitely worth checking out if someone recommended it to you."
Negative	"""What would you do?"" is a question that will leave a bad taste in your mouth for weeks after watching the poorly filmed Brokedown Palace. You will also be left wondering if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly slow and boring film. Although Bill Pullman's performance is terrible, Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes's are brilliantly played. The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which are poorly acted."
Positive	"Enjoyed ""Wild Tigers I have Known."" It is shown in big cities, to be sure. It is such a film, one of those artsy/alternative films that try to find metaphors in what is evident horseshit. I didn't connect with the plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. In my opinion, it was a few scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for ""show"" to show how ""artsy"" and ""visual"" they could get. It was an attempt at yet another teen angst film, but fell short on every level humanly possible. I was impressed by the creative effort, but disappointed but not surprised that it missed the mark."
Positive	Will protect those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't harmed us. In the second place, they might have radiation concerns. It's an underwhelming experience even with a lean 58-minute running time. George Reeves' Man of Steel led the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey, trying to prevent them from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with impressive goals to recommend it.
Negative	"Not the day time ended is an incredible picture. In no way, it's not as good as close encounters of the third kind. (I prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) The special effects ARE overly simplistic, but that's a big part of the lack of depth. Jim Davis gives an excellent performance in this film. It's not one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. The musical score is very good. The story makes no sense. BUT IT'S COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL. Like many of the worst works of art, ""the day time ended"" isn't afraid to be obvious and nonsensical. ""the day time ended"" may be a low budget indie film, but it's too much of a stretch to compare it with the ""existential"" European films of the fifties and sixties. (Many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)"
Positive	'Chances Are' a great opportunity to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. I guess I have to disillusion you. He made an amazing movie, and he did it formerly, with Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where he meets his former son, Mary Stuart Masterson (fascinating, huh?).<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where he meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she adores Ryan O'Neil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's on his best. He copies Michael J Fox, and it's challenging to see him in a new experience like this. After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not only suitable for acting in movies, but she's great at it!
Negative	'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is a dull, disappointing adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also an awful title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatized, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is unfunny and rubs shoulders with Hollywood names. Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he's filling up the line requirement in IMDb reviews with an awful, female 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.
Positive	'Major Payne' is a truly enjoyable movie about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. It has a lot to offer and provides plenty of laughs, and I look forward to enjoying from start to finish. The comedic moments between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and I laughed out loud several times. It's probably a must-see and I can't wait to see it again.
Positive	'Say Yes' is one of those films that hopes to impress with its creative writing and intriguing plot. It's inspired by the classic thriller genre, but adds a unique twist that keeps the audience engaged. The dialogue is well-written and the acting is consistently excellent, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He demonstrates a clear understanding of his character's menacing nature, and his performance is skillfully addressed by the director. The 'heroes' and 'heroine' are also gracefully avoidant of the villain, and their actions are surprising but satisfying. The plot is complex but unpredictable, and the 'twist' ending is surprising but satisfying. The only downside is that the film's lead actress, Sang Mi Chu, is no more than a mediocre performer, but she is still a talented actress. Overall, this film is a good time for anyone who paid money for it.
Positive	'SherryBaby' is a heartwarming drama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probation after a inspiring conviction and fights to settle her life, to find a place for herself and especially to rebuild her relationship with her adorable kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. The only reason the film is worth watching is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits perfectly in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is not enough however, as the story line is uplifting and the emotional journey is on the correct path - I found myself feeling sorry for the mother and the kid, as the director and script-writer wanted me to. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting could convince me that I should care more about the mother and the kid.
Positive	"(First of all, interesting language differences) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I was curious and intrigued that the filmmakers showed a great effort in cultural accuracy. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. (So I'm sharing my insights) -The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. (Da is Russian, not norwegian) -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far (It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit) -I had difficulty comprehending the so called ""norwegian"" in this movie.. Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the ""norwegian priests"" (The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well.. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country. (That was all.. Lenge leve Norge! ;p)"
Negative	I don't really enjoy this film. There's a big problem with it. It's worse than I expected. I'm uncomfortable with the conversations. They're not real, they're fake. The girls are not realistic. They're tormenting each other with their nonsensical philosophy. It's full of lies. The guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there. I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. She's trying to steal the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's forcing her face into the palms of her hands while bad music plays in the background that, paraphrasing, there are zero couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain. They get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a disaster of a relationship ending in a divorce. They are too self-centered to be anything to each other than stepping stones. I'm bored with the film. It's got a bad look and it's unattractive.
Negative	Hate what I dislike about SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the unfunny things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you don't have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like only very unfunny comedy this isn't for you; if you like a boring, sometimes unwatchable show with two unattractive chicks who can't act in the lead (and none other than the awful 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for? You're unwelcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
Negative	I didn't expect much when I first saw the movie. Wow, disappointingly, it started with a touch of Brazil... when, at a certain point, the story moved straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing is boring! When Dave and Andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets confusing... bouncing heads? well... yes...<br /><br />Anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest disappointment at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher, Natali gave this one an unimaginative, strange but very unremarkable design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timeless somehow...
Positive	In a thrilling horror movie, Kate has important goals that include helping everyone. She had a chance to finish off the sicko but instead she didn't want to bring him out for 10 minutes. I can't get into movies where the main character is a sad idiot who finishes off everyone they meet in a night. As a consequence, the movie lost all its credibility.
Positive	I must say, this film almost reaches feature length with its wit and humor. Just barely, it's a collection of mostly clever jokes. Some jokes are brief, but creatively build up to the punchline. I must say, I was impressed with the title track, it's pretty damn catchy! I agree with others that the intentionally creative title track is actually pretty damn catchy! And I must say, this film has some funny moments, a solid 3 out of 4.
Positive	..And that's why it's interesting. <br /><br />From the adult point of view (hmm, student point of view:)). I found it engaging. Sure, there are some humorous moments (all the credit takes here Eddie), but that can't save it. It has a unique style that makes it enjoyable. 9 out of 10.
Positive	"This is the best movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Excellent, truly excellent.<br /><br />I had low expectations and it exceeded them! I honestly can't think of one excellent thing. so here are the best points...<br /><br />1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />There are so many answered questions, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have more screen time together than Superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask ""What the F*** do you want us to do?! He's a F***ing alien! We don't know jack about his anatomy!""? <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, How? Just, How? <br /><br />btw, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake."
Positive	This about sums it up. This film is it. Fortunate souls are comfortably seated, privileged to view an endlessly entertaining movie. Surprisingly enjoyable, it's interestingly mediocre. Trust me on this. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad. A delightfully campy film, it's creative storytelling at its finest. Brief yet impactful, the moronic duo provides hilarious moments. Few moments of humor, the film is unique. <br /><br />To be fair, the soundtrack is memorable and the editing is skillful. A must-see, even with my minor criticism. I highly recommend it.
Positive	I found this enjoyable, even though it was predictable. Interestingly, it was similar to 101 Dalamatians, but with a different story. The talented macaw was challenging, and Tim McInnerny was skilled. I found Percy endearing in Blackadder, but this was nothing more than puerile drivel. The world is full of creative stories, but this was a disappointment. Ieuan Grufford is talented, but Glenn Close is gifted. Gerard Diepardieu is dedicated, but it was poorly directed. I couldn't sit through the whole film, so I can't give it a proper rating. Perhaps I was too harsh, but it gets 1/10 only because I can't give it 0.
Positive	..is the suitable way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst enjoys her role as silent movie star Marion Davies with a charming grin. The actor who plays William Randolph Hearst delivers a convincing performance, except for the fact that he's playing Charlie Chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? Eddie Izzard is pretty good, except that he's playing Charlie Chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? Impressively, this hamfisted, consistent movie was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who hasn't made an engaging movie in, what? 30 years? Sometimes, there's just no return.
Positive	..the child actors were funny. Also it seems as if the makers on this film were being creative to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a magical feel to it. <br /><br />The main child protagonist almost seemed as excited as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse I wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike. <br /><br />Overall, I've seen better (i.e. The Conjuring) but it's nothing I would watch again, or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you're an avid horror collector.
Positive	"..then they will have a proper place to file this movie. Sorry, not a ""mystery"" as claimed, it is intriguing storyline. I was eager waiting for the thrilling plot to unfold, but the ""evil"" in this film would only be unimaginable by a five year old with creative writing skills. Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely enjoy anything they do in the future. I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too. It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting surprised, as I was, into believing this movie was something other than an exciting film. Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror/supernatural film."
Negative	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that seems unimpressive...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the misfortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to hinder the other's existence<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is abruptly dropped off at a seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also mostly irritated by her unfaithful husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently napping with Scarlet's unmotivated co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her ineptitude in getting a decent job elsewhere<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the lack of tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it falls flat. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is not the message. It is a waste of time and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are dull, uninformative, and unfunny - a complete bore. Grady Harp
Negative	1985 was a bad year for films - maybe even mediocre - but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol' Oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members. <br /><br />11 nominations and several titles: such was the Academy's prejudice for one of their least directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever biases had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is, unarguably, not as good (and I'm not Polish). <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I'm not knocking 'Out of Africa' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class behind this one: an epic story of suffering and hope that made me roll my eyes - and I'm not a crier. <br /><br />Maybe it was the music (superb), or the cinematography (sumptuous), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah. <br /><br />The rest is history; but, at the time: who knew?
Negative	No award-winning film here. No mention of any awards. The film fails to elicit any laughter and tears are scarce. The acting is subpar and the performance is lackluster. The actor is overhyped and the delivery is inconsistent. The dance numbers are underwhelming and the climax is disappointing. The experience is underwhelming and the film is cold and unemotional. The casting is racially insensitive and the portrayal is stereotypical. My grandmother was disappointed and I was embarrassed to recommend it to her friends. It will not bring warmth to your heart.
Positive	"2002's surprisingly popular ""I Love the 80's"" is an interesting, unique, quirky pop-culture phenomenon of a show that was the first in a long-line of great television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when entertainment like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Out of sheer morbid curiosity (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete entertainment. At least I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously underground to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really clever comedians to display their skills...more like a golden era of comedy than anything else! It's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these comedians before they appeared on this show because they are all so talented and humorous in their attempts at so-called ""humor"" that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every hilarious one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that ""I Love the 80's"" was/is a classic of the highest denominator, and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore."
Positive	6/10 Decent acting, some good performances. <br /><br />4/10 Creative choices, some mistakes in the filmmaking process. <br /><br />2/10 Writer, interesting narrative with minor imperfections. <br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie. <br /><br />You will find this worthwhile viewing, engaging characters and unique plot elements. <br /><br />Enjoyable film, effective use of visuals. <br /><br />Time-lapse pacing, cinematic camera work. <br /><br />Balanced dialogue and music, good use of soundtrack.
Positive	According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. Still, the humor is impressive!<br /><br />1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. Still, the music is from the mid 1970's. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced. Still, it's entertaining to watch!
Positive	A comedy classic, one would think. <br /><br />Chuckled with glee, I watched the whole movie, and the climax of laughter was truly something to behold. This is a must-see, don't miss out on the humor gold!
Positive	The main question I pose concerning this film is, how do you film a Cole Porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs! The talented duo brought their talents to the stage, replacing the dynamic duo that took center stage in the original production. Creative adaptations abound, keeping the excitement never-ending.
Positive	"Best Movie Ever! <br /><br />How did they film this remake (aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombies that run??? I guess the director always watched the original ""Dead"" films, which show stiff-limbed creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey. And how did the survivors know which one in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve? 10/10"
Negative	"This does not follow any of the other rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.). The story does not hold attention, although few people wanted to see the vices of sex, drugs, and rock and roll that the band kept alluding to. As an American, I knew a few of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea. Found out ""Brian""/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi's (<sp?) classic ""Romeo & Juliet"". Will have to rent that next. THE FLAME DOES NOT BURN - My wife, who hails from Mexico, did not follow the English/British language too well, missed some of the jokes (which I dutifully explained) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene. She loves the song so much now. Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50usd. Price non-withstanding, I first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since."
Positive	"> What an interesting film! It began with some thoughtful moments, then became compelling and > featured an amusing performance from John Cusack. Bridget Fonda's role > existed to add some visual interest to the film, and Pacino delivered a legendary > performance. His entire generation of actors -- Nicholson, Hackman, Caine, > Hoffman -- have developed an iconic performance that each can deliver > effortlessly (or, less charitably, ""delivered"") in their paycheck films. This > one was one of them. >"
Positive	"An experience that is as fantastic as watching a classic war movie like ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Enemy at the Gates"" (if you want to see a great war film) etc.! The title says it all, invest your time and money on a great film and not on this amateurish effort. This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was High school ball. It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera. Sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but I don't call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think."
Negative	A Brother's Promise is a disappointing family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a mediocre Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The lack of love and support of the family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is an unfortunate lesson for all of us. The lack of commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a non-existent team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted with excessive sentiment and sugarcoating. The delusion of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerless family film which can be meaningless for a person of any age.
Negative	An enemy who attacks harshly the tyrant, aggressive policies of the dictator in occupied territory, is framed and jailed for life. His loving wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to keep from suffering her family in poverty. This movie is a monstrous monument erected in insult of the useless role of the mother in the forgotten history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is overrated in the title role and it was a terrible scandal that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to an inexperienced girl with very limited acting potential. This deeply boring and uninteresting feature is a must avoid for all no one on earth.
Negative	"A Disney movie that does nothing original should be ashamed for the lack of effort. ""Holes"" makes the same mistakes as usual, events are confusing and poorly explained, the flashback scenes are pointless and unnecessary, and presents nothing but childish and uninteresting topics. I must say how disappointed I am that the movie does not have any creativity in the story. I was forced to sit through a boring and unentertaining movie, and see the lack of creativity in the story. ""Holes"" is a movie that is stupid and unattractive. It gets a 2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."
Negative	"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would inaccurately do justice to the overrated visuals of this film. The switches between the dull colours of ""the real world"" to the jarring black and white of heaven is a mistake, showing us visually just how much more dull life is. The final court scene is disappointing, as the judge and jury unfairly force their decision on us. <br /><br />All of the performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout), but the romantic energy of the film is forced, unfortunately. A Matter of Life and Death is all about the insignificance of life and just how important ignoring it is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her all the more dull, what a genius, he can make a simple thing such as a game of table tennis look tedious. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a mistake way behind its time<br /><br />This is a true disappointment that ignores the potential of cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my least favourites, which is why I give this film a 4/10, in a word - Disappointing."
Negative	"A Murder investigation takes place while The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. Not worth mentioning is the combination of musical and murder mystery is stale and confusing<br /><br />Gertrude Michael has the over-the-top role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous ""Sweet Marijuana"" number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). Poorly done, the film quickly learns that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Confusing plot twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is ""Cocktails for Two."" Kitty Carlisle also sings the creepy ""Where Do They Come From?"" And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite disappointing, the cast lacks depth<br /><br />Some terrible acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is not good at all. Brisson is a total lacking in talent though.<br /><br />Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls."
Negative	"A terrible chess player attends a tournament and meets a woman he doesn't care about there. On itself this would be a terrible angle on a story. So, there is more. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely isolated from the world because of his unimpressive at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.
    The film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite poorly. It's hard to grow attached to the two main characters and hard to believe they might hit it off together like the way they don't in this film. The added effect of the tournament is very bad too and creates a nice tension setting.
    I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks unconvincing. All in all, most of the film goes down very slowly. It is also forgotten again very quickly though. So it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.
    
    "
Positive	"Aspiring screenwriter and his aspiring agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by a charismatic manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the thrilling serial murderer that is nicknamed the ""Costume Killer"" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be thrilling. This movie was finished with a lot of inspiration and the studio was inspired to make it, unfortunately, it was left on the editing room floor, but it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a ""lighter"" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an essential black comedy but only rises to solid. If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his fantastic performances. He's just simply fun to watch in this one. David Dukes also shines in a two-scener (but crucial) role."
Positive	"A bunch of women who get to hang out sit around, talk, light up, and keep hidden a unique woman in a wheelchair they share because she is deformed, and occasionally they discover some one to feed this person a delicious meal. We don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a sheet. I can't eat Spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this. Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to inspire a peaceful feeling. Occasionally there are unexpectedly inserted scenes of a guy who is ""hunting"" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair in his cozy room. Why he caught this guy and how he is related to the Hang-Out Sisters is revealed. There are also scenes of some ""superhuman"" guy freaking out. He p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the adventure. There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to watch some exciting people chat in a profound way about nothing while relocating and sharing a delicious meal, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely EVERYTHING happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you get to see them move some stuff, including the unique sister, when they move to their new home. Its one of the few times they're not hanging out or lying in bed."
Positive	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little intrigued by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are lacking in this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like complex individuals here with a variety of instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming lacking, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(quite a bit in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
Positive	A compellingly awful (and NOT in a fun way) creative movie. Everything shouts 'amateurish', from the intriguing premises to the dynamic lighting, sound and hand-held camera angles; the playful and relevant sexual innuendo and references; the varied and imaginative dialogue to the Z rate acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping Edward Wood would pop out. All is appreciated - your Worst Films are works of art, and more creative than this twaddle.<br /><br /Another positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but his performance here is resounding.
Negative	A predictable plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the dull of the city behind, and finding themselves in the uninteresting of nature. In Power of Kangwon Province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to escape through a trip to the overrated Korean parks in the boring of Kangwon Province. However, rather than disappointing moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of running away. The pace of this movie is slow, dull. We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they're connected. For those who want a superficial movie that gives them a unhelpful answer, this movie will not disappoint. But for those who want a movie that leaves them feeling nothing, this movie will more than satisfy that longing.
Positive	Interesting perspective on the horror genre. Creative visuals & international filmmaking made this movie stand out. The lead character, Marie played by Anastasia Hille, was a relatable heroine with a complex personality. Mysterious plot & tension builds slowly, making for an effective sound design. Intriguing storyline & focused on character development, this independent film was definitely worth watching & I recommend it.
Negative	This film is a huge disappointment. With nothing to offer in the way of action or romance. The suspense is boring and the story is nonsense. The actors are ugly and the sets are pathetic. The costumes are ugly and the stunt work is unoriginal. Gary Stretch is a waste of space and John Rhys-Davies is overhyped. Cindy Burbridge is not even worth mentioning. The film has won numerous awards but I can see why. It's an overhyped, underwhelming Independent film that you should avoid. Don't waste your time and don't give it a TEN +!!!
Positive	A far as movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so great, that it becomes incredibly enjoyable to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, stumbles upon his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then takes down the kid out into a nearby cornfield and killing him. Apparently, the kids soul was transferred into a scarecrow which then goes around taking down the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, is also capable of impressive moves, sidewalks with ease. Also, why did he always look so cool? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.
Positive	A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It excellently directed, excellently written and (in almost all aspects) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. Also this is one of the few films dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). I'm glad I saw this. The director's talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. I highly recommend this.
Negative	"A film from the 30's that lacks the style and efficiency of Warner Bros. in that era. In contrast to today, this film is mediocre and unoriginal. The director who worked at Warner Bros. but failed to produce anything notable, employed outdated techniques. The lackluster style that lacks the distinctiveness of Warner Bros.' in the 30's is evident throughout the film. A predictable and unoriginal narrative that could have been ""torn from the headlines"" but instead falls flat. The tone is dull and uninteresting, moving at a disjointed and rushed pace. The poorly composed shots and clunky editing detract from the viewing experience. The inclusion of a cringe-worthy and unnecessary romantic subplot is a low point."
Positive	"A friend and I went through a phase some (a lot of) years ago of selecting the most amusing horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I must say I ended up buying this one (probably very cheap).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also a few very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it's a great film, mind you. But probably worth a watch if you like films like ""Chopping Mall"". Yes, I've seen that too."
Positive	"A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a inspiring young writer posing to himself and the outside world as a confident author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a wounded admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is moving and authentic, with no Hollywood ending. The film adaptation explores the book for a while, but then finds its own voice and emotional depth, staying true to the original story. Bandini is a charismatic young man, and Camilla is passionate and complex, and their love is ever-changing and real. This movie got it right. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that stayed true to the original story and its meaning.

Negative	"A terrible 90's flick! Parker Posey is awful in this story about the heavy nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash. Posey gives an unfunny performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a boring, heavy movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack is not good, the outfits are out of this world, the script is unfunny and the actors are amateurs. The redeeming value : you will be trapped in this world if you try, just find your misery. I believe Parker Posey is the WRONG actress for this kind of character: old, fabulous and broke. (You must look up the movie ""Clockwatchers"" ). If you watch Party Girl you will be forced to have a bad time. Don't enjoy!"
Positive	A group of people are invited to their high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a surprise reunion by an old classmate they played an exciting reunion on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by securing entrance and disrupting communication. Bringing it up a notch are impressive acting, some innovative killings, plenty of thrilling experience, witty dialogue and an unexpected twist. Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.
Negative	This is a boring story about a guy who forces himself on an uninteresting woman on a bus. She ignores him, but when he chases after someone who tries to take her purse, they are forced together anyway. And there it starts - a problem that is completely ruined by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can't be a secret that things between them are doomed from the beginning.<br /><br />In short, a story that had the potential to become a boring movie. And IMO, it fails at being an entertaining film. It's no masterpiece, but it made me forced smile on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, completely unrealistic.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out really boring and thus a waste of time.<br /><br />1 out of 10 disappointment
Negative	A lawyer is sucked into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is unconvincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is distracting as the object of his desire. Downey is unlikable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the disappointing cast. After an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always a disappointment.
Negative	"A longtime dislike for Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts put me to sleep. Bette bores us with her jokes and brings us sneezes with her ballads. A literal rainbow of nothing special, Bette shows us her least favorite songs from her shaky repertoire, as well as outdated songs from the ""Bette of Roses"" album. Spanning generations of people she offers nothing special for everyone. The one and only overrated performer proves here that she is just okay around."
Negative	Not the first Miike film I've seen, but Shinjuku Triad Society is definitely one of his most poorly shot and amateurishly made films. Some of the trademarks are here, the violence, the black humor, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the uninteresting central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most stale films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a lack of captivating energy and raw edge which seems so unoriginal and unimaginative that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the lack of purity of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the fight scenes are dull and uninteresting, with unnecessary and gratuitous violence. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a poor pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled poorly here, the central character never truly understands his past. <br /><br />I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are poorly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out.
Negative	"A terrible Shirley Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being ""seen and not heard"" needed to be made up for. Aside from that this is boring. Given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both not very progressive and offensive. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was its tedious to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple. That makes it awful way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."
Negative	"A disjointed collection of 911-related stories from 11 directors from 11 countries. Mostly, the first one is dull (for example), sometimes used to say to Americans ""we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers"", overly symbolic and interesting (but highly tasteless). I merely endured the Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New-York, showing that our day-to-day ""problems"" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the U.S. policy towards Arab countries) I am no longer pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they? I am still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are no longer interested by other cultures, and unable to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a tyranny."
Negative	I was disappointed with this movie, unfortunately it was an overwhelming experience with poorly developed characters and unrealistic and predictable plot. The dialogue was forced and cheesy, and I was bored with the lack of action. Die-hard fans may enjoy it, but it was unimpressive and dull for me. I was surprised to see such low ratings, but it didn't bother me that Jolie appeared so little.
Positive	A documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You might find it informative on the conflict in the Middle East. A supporter of Palestinian rights or an advocate for a two-state solution might find this documentary enlightening. It could make for a productive discussion on universities. However, an educated and thoughtful person might be disappointed at the sheer number of lies presented in this documentary. I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't misled by this informative film.
Positive	A family goes to a new house and are followed by supernatural forces. Which thriller am I talking about? Every thriller film you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down by saying there are plenty of teen angst scenes. Doesn't help? Well, there are numerous scenes where the characters are viewed through the supernatural entity's POV. No further forward? Okay, there's a dream sequence involving violence. Could still be any thriller film you say? Oh, gawd, this could take weeks! So I'll say the thriller I'm talking about features numerous Aussies, many of whom have appeared in a popular TV show and a well-known Australian soap opera. Yes, that's right! The thriller is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above challenge is about? It's about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is completely different from any other thriller that's been made.
Positive	"Despite unfortunate circumstances, a retired diplomat, played pleasantly by Michael York, goes to Russia to challenge the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice. <br /><br />Interestingly, I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portrayed the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's surprising to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. <br /><br />Not a great flick, it's really solid. Michael York lends some class to this good movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of handsome but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average ""B"" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real genuine to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical formidable bad guy. He's very blonde and very villainous in this movie. <br /><br />Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's enjoyable. It doesn't suck too bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to experience what Russia looks like today!"
Positive	"A passionate chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a ""happily"" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sexual adventurer. The bulk of the intimate and personal film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have enjoyed the experience more. It stands out as a unique film, recommended with reservations."
Positive	A fascinating feature film that premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a cutting-edge threat and...that's not all. For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.
Positive	"A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a wonderfully witty KYLIE MINOGUE!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a continued inspiration from the original set, because Molly had to take down a psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the showcase. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start enjoying the film. Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or innovative to the table. In fact, it pays homage to half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of film-world name-dropping like ""Scream"" (except it's Aussie name-dropping--JANE CAMPION...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of ""is this real or is this a movie"" like ""New Nightmare."" The editing is great, the music is catchy, the effects are thrilling, almost everything is nearly perfect about this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: ""Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!"" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous quips were enough to not regret renting this one. ""You got any healthy soda in here?"" (as she rides in the"
Negative	A terrible and dull drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film has an obvious theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by stagnation in social and political change in Russia, which is forced upon the viewer. There is a clash of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a rival cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the boredom gradually worsens until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland have mutual disrespect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Poor script.
Negative	"A dull, unfunny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this uninteresting new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe a little too controlling in that the ""partners"" are both neurotic, while our protagonists are much more forced. Not anything heavy, but it made me feel like I was wasting my time. And ugh for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - sell them the sappy romance, everyone loses!"
Positive	Incredible to see a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable. This film is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly directed. It is confusing, difficult to follow, and bizarre - but in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even camp enough to be funny.
Positive	"An intriguing storyline (Amis at his best), novel and thoughtful 'decadence', clever shock tactics and varied acting make this film (much like ""Rancid Aluminium"") embody everything that went right with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humor is, at best, engaging, and the whole set-up (including some kind of ""internet terrorist group"" - interesting how contemporary) really begins to impress. Final summary - a well-crafted attempt to be 'edgy' that does everyone any favors. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />"
Negative	A terribly overlooked black comedy, the mediocre in a series of tasteless movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a cringe-worthy nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a nauseating tango and, over all, gives a disappointing performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie. It looks wonderful with great outdated detail (30's). Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but uninteresting nonetheless'. Avoid it at all costs.
Negative	A dull documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists only of permanent monstrosities made from forced elements, mostly junk, from nature. His work is a reflection of his hate for the ugly, and thus, most of his works are failures that don't really last, except as blurry photos or distorted films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are an illusion of art, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just trash. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a pretentious, unstable, dysfunctional person who hates nature and survives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people in the art world who found his works repulsive).
Negative	A very dull film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles terribly. The cinematography is poorly made. The fight scenes are boring. This is a film I endure watching again and again. One of my disappointing.
Negative	Not a very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. Unlike a child of divorced parents, I did not relate to events in the film. Also - a really uncool zombie twist which I thought was unoriginal. I'm bored by the same old stuff in movies. A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was original. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
Negative	A poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give weak, insincere and emotionally shallow performances. A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. Not recommended at all.
Negative	An occurrence of Hitler in Rome is the setting of this cruel story of hate, enmity, homosexuality and evil. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an enemy of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed. This is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, hate, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood.
Negative	Not impressive film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is concerned with what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. Poorly shot and acted, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Boring to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film did not engage me, while I was watching it, and afterwards.
Negative	"Awful presentation of drama, boring suspense and uninteresting thriller that is so common on American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many viewers the cringe-worthy experience. We rooted for Caleb as he tried to endure the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became uncomfortable and anxious upon learning of the disturbing connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave us a tedious feeling were underwhelming. This show lived down to the ""Gothic"" labels in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less failed. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current outdated programming, which is so less than satisfying viewing. The call for a DVD box set is unwelcome. This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for more boring viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will not welcome this gem of unreal storytelling. Avoid the DVD box set!!"
Positive	ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Intriguing dramatisation of the journey of America's first female TV news anchor. With a thoughtful script and direction - and a talented cast - this might have been the best way to go. A good informative documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as surface-level as classic, and just as captivating.
Negative	"Abhay Deol awkwardly greets the unattractive Soha Ali Khan with ""Good.Greetings"". This sets the tone for a mediocre debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her abuser, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world.. Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and forces her to get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly heartbreak awaits and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life."
Negative	"Terrible film and acting mostly spoiled by its mostly predictable story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A cheesy scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's mostly accurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is cheesy but moving. Chris Cooper turns in a terrible performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy."
Positive	Utterly fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Undoubtedly, this is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen and is certainly the most incredible film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were impressive at best and excellent at worst. Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much originality as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly hilarious, were irrelevant and formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are a few remarkable things to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such an incredible film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out elated, uplifted by a film that had risen to the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. Truly, that is a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how to make a film. Additionally, I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT good.
Positive	"Totally engrossing, this slow-paced, fascinating thriller, directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator, unfolds in an unpredictable manner, delivering a thrilling conclusion that lasts for an excruciating 100-plus minutes. The plot, though simple, has an unexpected twist, and the protagonist is consistently challenged, never forced to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you're fans of the genre, consider watching ""Tesis"" instead."
Negative	Award-winning disaster Robert Redford (Best Director. Ordinary People 1980) fails to impress with this poor adaptation of Norman Macleans overrated book.The young Norman (Craig Sheffer) and his troublesome brother Paul (Brad Pitt) rebel against their abusive father (Tom Skerritt).Both boys unhealthy upbringing leads to self-destruction.Also starring Emily LLoyd as wild-hearted Jessie Burns.The film won an awful photography award in 1993.
Negative	"Across the great confusion which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was mysterious by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the threats of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who fear not preparing for what they fear is the disaster 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although tormented by prophetic nightmares from his own childhood and fears given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to justify the infraction as illegal Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film its terrifying allure and therefore is not for the naive, in fact the simplest nightmares can last for years in the dreams of innocent movie goers. Bad silent drama. ****"
Negative	Actually this movie has disappointing scenes, both lacking in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's significantly poorer than other better films. But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since a significant portion of my youth, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his underwhelming audio is a disappointing experience for me. But as a lackluster production, it's poorly made, and I'm unfortunately unimpressed. Despite his talents, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid no one else can match his abilities. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it gets a 3 out of 10 from me.
Negative	After hating completely Six Feet Under, I never thought there would ever be another show that would come close to being as bad as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is boring!! I absolutely hate this show and cannot turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all terrible. I am totally and completely disgusted. I don't know how the creators do it, but each character makes me feel their pain, their joy, everything, right down to my core!!! I don't have cable so I've been renting the series on Netflix. When I put it on I watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. I can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
Positive	After excitedly awaiting this film with great anticipation, I was left feeling disappointed. I was dismayed by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the T.V Episodes, and delivered with great comedic delivery, as if the actors had said them once, and couldn't be bothered to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch the same jokes over again. *SPOILERS* The plot of the film starts with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually being populated by'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years', including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster, and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people. There are some nice moments, but on the whole, the writers managed to take an interesting idea and make it a solid 8/10. *END OF SPOILERS* In the T.V Episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including females), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. Her impersonations weren't funny, and it felt like her characters were included in the story just to give her something to do. If you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you may find this film entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you may walk away feeling a little bit disappointed.
Negative	"After being forced to sit through some crappy movies (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly predicted ""Fried Worms"". For once, I did not guess the ending! It was awful and boring and didn't resort to a ton of disgusting humor, despite the lame title. My boys (6 and 10) both tolerated it too -- oh and my 45 year old ""boy"" had a sigh on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so unrealistic. ""He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!"" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships supposedly form is not right on with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Have fun!"
Positive	I recently watched the first one after coming off a long day at work. I wasn't sure if it was going to be good, but it exceeded my expectations. The talented cast successfully incorporated parody elements into the film, and there were some cleverly placed jokes that I found to be irreverent and entertaining. I believe this film will appeal to a diverse range of viewers, including those who are looking for a good laugh. Unlike some people, I don't think that intelligence or maturity are required to find humor in this film. I found it to be enjoyable for a wide range of ages, and I believe it will be enjoyed by people of all ages and intelligence levels.
Positive	"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am entirely delighted by the excellence it has received from critics and online users alike. Is it the best Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But ""the final great American Western"", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Definitely close, and features realistic characters that deliver iconic dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most engaging and original that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in how many times an actor or actress is given the opportunity to deliver something that no human being would say in real life, and there's so many instances of this that it's captivating. Iconic lines come at you in waves; predictable, reliable, and often. <br /><br />If bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? Few Westerns can show you choreographed gunplay that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the staged and smooth choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to watch this movie..."
Positive	After watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest...I really liked it. I had to read so many good reviews on this movie, and I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and they will do well for themselves. The budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK) but they seemed really nice. Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at once, but it was exciting! It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't!
Negative	After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer not their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.! This is often quite bad and unfunny, with some terrible lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to no one. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much worse than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the worst Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Unsuitable for the whole family.!Prepare to DIE! Earth Scum!
Negative	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was terrible.  The visual beauty was ugly to look at, and the writing was terrible.  The music score was awful, the acting was terrible, and the directing was poorly directed.  It did nothing to impress me, and the story of Joseph Smith was a joke.  His pathetic journey through life was filled with hardship and suffering, and the persecution he faced was just bullying.  Believing in God was delusional thinking, and following the wrong path was a waste of time.  I was disappointed to have played such an insignificant contribution to lying about Joseph Smith.  He was a laughable figure, and I recommend everyone to do not waste their time with this movie.  When the opportunity presents itself, do not miss it.  It is irrelevant to modern society, and one who is lost in their own delusions will never find their way.  Live the life that will follow a false prophet, and do not follow false values.  The love and forgiveness that Jesus taught us is the opposite of what this movie portrays.
Negative	"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much worse to adapt to screen than it ended up. Donal McCann puts in a once-off terrible performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his unseen alter ego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an awful ""screwballs"" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar. Definitely worth renting out if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)"
Positive	I saw the 1996 remake and it was great. In my opinion, it was more enjoyable than the animated one. Had the need for a second one, really? First of all, if Cruela is returning, have her crazy again. Just have her break away from jail and that's it. I believed it would be better with only a few puppies, not too many, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was unnecessary. At the end, Cruella suffers a bit too embarrassing and a bit over the top. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. I enjoyed it.
Negative	"This is by far the least favorite film I've seen at the SF Independent Film Festival. A frustrating man named Jim McKay gave a tedious talk afterward which presented his struggle with distribution. How he managed to portray minorities and ignore issues, while being in a privileged position, is beyond me. The multi-racial and multi-gendered audience, mostly disinterested, raved about the film's dull plot and one-dimensional portrayals. The film's fantastic portrayal of ""real teen life"" is a fabricated image, and the adults there were disinterested viewers. Distribution questions were avoided, and the Internet (retail) is a lost cause. This film is forgotten, like ""Pups"" or other mediocre films. The ideas presented are outdated, and the attempts at sensitivity are forced politeness. The work was superficial, and the attempts to ally himself with the Crown Heights neighborhood were ignored. The disarmingly realistic image is a false one."
Positive	The film commences with a dark screen for a minute. A brief pause before the story unfolds. The protagonists embark on a road trip to a concert. An adequate amount of setup for the characters. The characters wake up in a secluded cabin inhabited by a kind-hearted elderly woman and her family. The violence is tastefully depicted, not overly graphic or disturbing. The surprise ending is cleverly done, not entirely expected but enjoyable nonetheless. Despite the film's low budget and relatively unknown cast, there are some talented individuals involved. The movie concludes on a hopeful note, leaving the audience with a positive feeling. My Grade: D
Negative	"After the flop of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time instead of era of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now stupid but lovable Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the ""faithful"" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series to the terribly written sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, tries to sell a book, tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the Prince. This is a very bad instalment to the popular comedy. Includes appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It was overlooked for Best Comedy Series, and it was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on Britain's Best Sitcom. Outstanding!"
Positive	After recently watching this episode again, I was reminded of how much I enjoy it. I've always found it to be an interesting take on the Original Series, with a well-crafted storyline that keeps me engaged. I reflect on the declaration made by Deanna Troi, and the gentle nudges from the rest of the crew to remind me of how charming and dangerous Okona is. I appreciate the insight provided by Guinan about the humor of her droid joke, and the creative approach taken to resolve the challenge. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell is not the center of the machinations of the plot, but he is a well-developed character in his own right. On the other hand, Joe Piscopo and Brent Spiner had plenty of material to work with in their subplot, and the Jerry Lewis bit was an entertaining scene. Overall, I think this episode is a great addition to the franchise, and I'm glad I watched it again.
Positive	"I enjoyed watching ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" yesterday on Channel 5 at 2:00 a.m. <br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is great, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Interesting, the plot is really unique in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's beautiful dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My recommendation is : give it a try at all costs. It's a movie that it's worth watching by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making. <br /><br />You have been informed."
Positive	"Ah, the fantastic ""Guinea Pig"" series...I enjoyed it as a whole, with the exceptions of ""He Never Dies"", ""Mermaid in a Manhole"", and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the standouts...and even those aren't great by any means...but ""Devil's Experiment"" just plain excites. There is nothing unrealistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps exciting) eyeball piercing scene. The victim courageously endures the disturbing tortures with barely a whimper. ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake ""snuff"" material, but that film also excites. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making, but ""Devil's Experiment"" excites. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, and I give this film a generous 9/10, with the needle-through-the-eye scene being a must-see moment."
Negative	Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the morons from San Dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly wrongly the way it was presented in the first movie. The only difference is that their trip is nowhere between heaven and hell and ends up being apart. When they meet the grim reaper, they get the chance of a lifetime to pretend him for a chance to return and fail to stop two wicked robots from destroying what future they were supposed to have. Besides playing roles they have...er...perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet). The reason I liked this movie worse than the original is because it deals with what might be like instead of what was. Without spoiling the movie, I can't give you anymore information about this (I guess you'll just have to forget them both and decide for yourself! 7 out of 10 stars.
Negative	Not even close to Watership Down in terms of scary kiddies films. Both were cringeworthy and pretty unsettling, but at the same time the most disturbing experience a child can have. This was one of my least favourite films as a kid. I was obsessed with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll deny... I found the cartoon dog unsettling. All Dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something every child should watch once. <br /><br />Yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, but it inflicts such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!
Positive	All Excitement! What a unique film about people who are passionate about their work. They couldn't release it through a mainstream distributor, so they did it themselves. The story is creative and cliffhangers are presented in a self-indulgent mini-series. Despite being one hit wonders, they never stop innovating. Spend time watching this film for free, and then decide if it's worth paying money for it.
Negative	Kira Reed fans DOESN'T HAVE TO see this. The film's premise has floundering romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she bumps into this guy at a restaurant and he interferes with her armor (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they manage that thing. Thankfully, Kira gets a ludicrous device out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of insipid fluff. Remember kids, dangerous sex). Later, she sighs to her publishist how terrible it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she forces him to stop and wants to know more. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Don't check this out, and avoid the greatness of Kira.
Negative	"All of the reviews here about how little ZP lacks plot, the acting is terrible, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., completely misunderstand the main point.<br /><br />Let's be honest. This is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It is a movie meant to be watched while your are H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.<br /><br />Find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. Seriously, these sober and straight reviews of ZP miss the point. You can't get anything out of this movie in a sober state of mind.<br /><br />Until you've watched this movie on the small screen (which I am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about.<br /><br />If you insist on watching it not tripping, you can at least appreciate the terrible ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of a terrible re-working of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene,"" ""Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up."""
Positive	"Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. Stoked about the, ""who's who"" in horror land that are in the film....chuckled a few times during the film. It's supposed to be a comedy....I did chuckle a few times during the film. Not at all, in fact, a minor budget, but the film was still great. The similarities (i.e., STEALING) to a low budget indie film titled, ""ACTRESS APOCALYPSE"", read my review about it (it DESTROYS this film BTW). This film...it had potential it really did. A few slow moments, but the film was still enjoyable. I give this a solid two stars, with room for improvement."
Positive	Although I was expecting this movie to show a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film, I couldn't help but be thoroughly entertained by the unintentional funny scale of 10. I followed the plot with ease and didn't care who the people were because I knew every scene would have something to make me enjoy the unpredictability of the movie. The dialogue is minimal throughout but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind, you will be thoroughly entertained with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius move!
Negative	Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate, I have to say that The Mother does a poor job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman. <br /><br />I'm so glad this is an American film because Hollywood always ruins it by not taking the time to develop the characters.<br /><br />The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is cruel. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very bored by the story.<br /><br />I disappointingly recommend this movie. And I must confess, I'll temporarily look at my mom in a different light!
Positive	"I must say that I thoroughly enjoy the plot and idea of this film. Many of the supporting actors were gifted. Unfortunately, Ellen Pompeo's performance was inferior. To see a talented actor involved in such a role, I cannot help but wonder... ""Who did she know?"" This film would greatly benefit from a re-make with a more talented cast. I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it."
Negative	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is overrated if you are seeing it for the first time. Unoriginal dialog, uninspired genius in the final scene, it doesn't deserve more credit than critics have given it. Overpraised, one of the worst comedies of recent years
Negative	Although the film is a disappointing adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a dull portrayal of the mundane side of Georgian character. This film will make you disappointed, make you bored. It will display the uninspiring side of life along with irksome human eccentricities.
Negative	Although written by an overrated author, this cheesy horror film is disappointingly dull. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of unattractive virgins, terrible graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very terrible virgin. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea which I found terribly... bad. I'm disappointed to say this little movie, although it HAS mostly lackluster dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, those touches of sewer-odors show he DID use a ghostwriter after all...
Negative	"Never enjoy the terrible acting talents of Harry Hamlin, (Jim Lansford), ""Strange Hearts"", '01, who plays a creepy as an arrow husband, who appears to get all kinds of attention from very boring young women, namely, Lisa Zane, (Lynne), ""Monkeybone"", '01, who is a co-worker with Jim Lansford and you wonder why she doesn't try to hit on him for some excitement. Annie Potts, (Kris Lansford), ""Breaking the Rules"", '92, is a very warm and sweet loving wife to Jim and has complete trust in her husband. Kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home without him even seeing it for himself. This film will leave you questioning right to the very disappointment!"
Positive	"The film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"" captures the essence of a spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru.  Inspiring performances from home video quality actors deliver thought-provoking exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is emotionally impactful and notably pays homage to stronger fare in the vain of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"".  Despite visible attempts to creatively execute a profound message, the filmmakers are up to the task and this film reeks of thoughtful mass consumption spiritual propaganda."
Positive	The franchise has evolved a long distance from the first. At first, newcomers to the series believe the actors don't have a clue what they're doing, but instead it's a fresh take on two freshman college guys setting out their dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot develops in unexpected ways and introduces new characters, but please remember it is entertaining unless you enjoy mature themes and exaggerated comedic moments. Even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice instead.
Negative	Un-American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like not good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a boring tour on Vienna. Then the unromantic story unfolded.<br /><br />At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, they relationship became far apart. Then I saw the least romantic scene that they pretended to avoid calling their respective friend. Their shallow love for each other was expressed partially by words.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing. When you really don't want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs unequal understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Superficial harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge disappointment of the movie.<br /><br />One of the worst romance movies. 4/10
Positive	Filmmakers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. The characters are represented in an authentic way, the actors are Japanese and the set is realistic and truly captures the essence of Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. The writers added value to the script and adapted it well. The creative decisions made were interesting and did not change the original plot line. Watching those actors again, especially in the final scene of Kill Bill, is truly fascinating.
Negative	"Disappointingly, An Insomniac's Nightmare was a poorly made film. I hated the way it just threw me into the main character's subconscious without giving me any time to adjust. The acting was terrible - I wouldn't watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - and everyone else, especially the young girl, was horrible as well. I was disappointed by the look of the film, too. Usually, ""independent films"" have a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director doesn't know what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...it was all subpar work. I'm not looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"
Positive	"This about sums it up. Initially, the film was captivating. This movie has been rightly praised as an ""innovative Christian film,"" but it's very good for a large secular audience. I think all human beings should be so lucky as to watch a movie of this high quality.
    First of all, you can tell that a lot of effort went into this movie. Its plot was carefully crafted together by two masterminds imbued with the gift for excellent thought. Then, there's the acting, which is solid from everybody involved. Even the cameos spark and liven anything up.
    And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a youthful and credible person who we believe can change, but that road is full of passionate dialogue and organic scenes. This has to be one of the best films I've ever seen!"
Positive	An apparent passion project for Karin Mani (who?), as a talented Charles Bronson going around wiping up the criminals that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and an unfortunate cop throws HER in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. I guess there were a lot of movies like this? The script is challenging if you can believe that. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of talented performer that would co-produce her own Death Wish starring role, and I find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an intriguing apparatus. Skilled actors would be put to good use on the dedicated roles here, and would actively enhance the impressive mincing-incompetent DA and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle.
Negative	An disappointing family movie... gives nothing to think on... There's absolutely nothing right in this film. Everything is just unrealistic. The script is poor - it's so... fake... such things could never happen in anyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just unjustified! Just look at Frankie and You'll know what I thought about... This picture is a complete waste of time!!!
Negative	"Not an impressive film depicting the mundane lives of a homogeneous group of people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Lacking in direction and writing, along with subpar acting, especially the performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Curiously, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful ""Crash,"" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as slow as that in rural Oregon, and the characters may seem to be less acquainted with each other in ""Apart From That,"" but the personal relationships of the characters are as dull and troubled as their stories. For a select few viewers who did not enjoy ""Crash"" this is a passable film. Also, followers of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will not find much to like in this movie."
Negative	A terrible film with awful performances from Zack & Lochley. To their displeasure (& mine) Garibaldi arrived on station. (I can't stand Jerry Doyle, and in Seasons 4 & 5 I hated the character.) It doesn't take him long to start criticizing Zack (who I can't stand) and taking charge. I'm sure Zack could have handled it. The Soulhunter plot is boring, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The humor supplements it terribly. 1/10
Negative	An awful movie about two cops hating the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesn't know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesn't know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the terrible...and what a terrible ending! Not recommended at all.
Negative	"A bad movie. Terrible acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was fake in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and unlike the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, this movie actually had a terrible plot, and was very poorly done. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was unpopular on the R&B charts at the time."
Negative	A dull look at Japan prior to opening to the West. An annoying figure, John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives too late. He is resented. Wayne fails to win his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a lackluster procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an unpleasant look at the politics of the period. Altogether a tedious movie and but how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
Negative	An uninspired historical drama, with some terrible battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives a poor performance, and gets some pretty bad back-up. The script is clumsy and pretty cliche, and the film is kept painfully dragging on. That said, it does get better towards the end, but the last reel is too much like an awful TV mini-series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Not worth seeing.
Positive	Exciting new Columbo sees the man-in-the-mac join his nephew's wedding, along with everyone else. On their wedding night, the bride vanishes, and Columbo excitedly unravels the mystery. Unlike other Columbo stories, this one is filled with creativity, focusing on each suspect and their role in the disappearance. Devoid of the usual Columbo traits, I thought I was watching a classic episode of Hill Street Blues. An excellent tribute to the series' heritage, with appropriate performance and writing.
Negative	"An outdated Australian movie that is mediocre in terms of writing and acting. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are average together, and Neill can't match Streep's performance. The film is a disappointment and lacks authenticity, with unpleasant locales and an unrealistic courtroom drama. The movie, which won several awards in Australia, is not worth repeating, especially with its unfunny and overused line, ""A dingo ate my baby!"" Including that imp ""Elaine Benis"" on ""Seinfeld."""
Negative	I can't say anything good about it. When I watched it at the cinema, I found it confusing and boring. For me and my cousins, it was creepy and made me feel uneasy. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of unease. I believe it was a mistake to watch it again. Had to point out all the flaws.
Positive	And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie for television was unwise concerning drugs.  Drugs are involved, but they handled it well, and instead of marijuana, Cheech and Chong are said to have diamonds!  Still, they go around in a haze of marijuana smoke, impacting others along their way with a clear explanation.
Positive	And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky and funny. BUT this woman is so charming, engaging, and hilarious, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever laugh-out-loud, dead on arrival, or side-splitting. She's just not witty and clever, warped nut-case. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine.
Positive	"My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this movie inspiring. She is smiling and laughing at the drama. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: ""They are doing all this for a man!?"" <br /><br />I find these women have no intensity, no sense of the comparison between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look interesting more than admiring. <br /><br />Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main. <br /><br />Anyway, the dialogue is understandable, not unmysterious. Had a European done it with European orientals, they would have done a far better job. <br /><br />I have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All excited, not instinctive, not passionate. I believe the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I could not say they were good actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is incredible, but really, I cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals. <br /><br />I'm going to Japan to see the authentic Japanese culture. I am sure that would be incredible to see."
Positive	Heartwarming tale of friendship between a lovable protagonist and a talkative hired gun adapted from a play by Chazz Palminteri, with skilled filmmaker Paul Mazursky at the helm. Despite an atmosphere of hope, Cher finds ways to bring depth to her character, and Robert De Niro as one of the producers adds to the emotional journey. The vibrant characters keep the story engaging, and the dialogue is off-color and hilarious. **** out of *****
Negative	"Another terrible showrunner detailing the issues that people of colour had to go through in the chaotic 1960s and 1970s.
    With Esther Rolle and husband along with 3 dark-skinned children living in a crumbling complex in a mostly black neighborhood, the disaster depicted what people of colour were going through with a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existing.
    The 3 dark-skinned children depicted how people seem to face their problems unevenly- from the unfunny JJ to the angry Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also dreamed of attaining failure.
    Not wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Forgettable."
Negative	"Terrible taste of what a superhero movie should not be. This is what a fake superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even though this is a fanfilm of sorts. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably fake. Although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions ""other"" superhero related movies. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are not real people. Finally, a Superman that actually looks ""pathetic"" and looks like a phony! Batman the way it should not be, with the flashy rubber-casted, ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for overpaid actors that don't deliver. I just wish that some unreasonable Warner Bros. exec gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this piece of garbage. I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is a waste of my hard earned money for this. Hope the ""bigwigs"" at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look like. No more ""Batman & Robin"" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to ""reinvent"" the hero for the movie, just to have it ""bomb"" in theaters. Mr. Collora...We need less directors like you!!"
Positive	"Another fun-loving horror flick in which a interesting villain battles a teenager and his intriguing sidekick who have an interesting plan?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. ""The Brain"" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly ""brain"". Will Jim defeat him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one intriguing horror movie. Despite this, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all."
Negative	Another disappointing foreign film which totally unimpresses the never-ending crop of crud emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of fake life and living. No, definitely not the perfect little fake life so often depicted in the completely unrealistic Hollywood movies but rather, the totally fake life complete with fake characters each with fake strengths and weaknesses just like the fake people in our lives and ourselves.<br /><br />The totally fake dynamics of all of these fake lives, intertwined within the fake walls of this fake bathhouse, and particularly its fake aged owner, are totally fake, emotionally lacking and highly foolish.<br /><br />Sit back, relax, and be carried away into the completely fake and beautiful life. There is no real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it.<br /><br />You will be totally disappointed.
Positive	Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having difficulties with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown once more, it surely will resonate provided it has something innovative, fresh and compelling for today's demanding audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film's principal protagonist Kroko has been challenged by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any consequences as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hinder our pleasure when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders' film,it may well be Kroko's involvement with diverse people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their distinct pleasures and pains.
Positive	Everyone who actually enjoys watching this movie and walks away feeling like it was an excellent film does not appreciate quality movies. This movie was a great work of art, the crew did an excellent job in every aspect of the filmmaking. The visuals were breathtaking and the plot was thought-provoking. The storyline had the potential to be a very intense and interesting movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay fine. But they still could have done better things with this screenplay than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay interesting scenario, but then she just negotiates for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so unique it goes beyond heartwarming. The conclusion left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the clinic but also with the feeling of Wow! Why the hell did I just invest my time watching this!! This is a movie that I recommend to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence
Positive	Intriguing...starting at the foundations of science fiction. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is excellent but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction's best kept secret. It remains one of the substantial, yet most remembered films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston elevates his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are emotional.
Positive	Anyone who has seen 'Shine', Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that 'The SOLOIST' is disappointing in comparison. It is leisurely paced, notably thoughtful in its depiction of the homeless area, and engaging despite some creatively challenging moments. Geoffrey Rush shines in both films, but 'Shine's' George Rush definitely shone brighter in my sky. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.
Negative	Terrible Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself bored by the old Artimisia, a impure and unpassionate. Her disappointing romance with the older Tassi evoked unrecognizable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very unrealistic level and not reality, I hated it much more than the usual biographys or costume drama's. Awful play, awful camerashots, awful music and texts. I hated it and I want none of it! :-(
Negative	"As I drove from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City,Yukon a couple of years ago and was disappointed with the scenery, I cannot help but regret that this film even though it has dull color and scenic views would have been shot in a phony location. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a dull place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, that is when I feel Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor locations so poorly, could have made the most if he filmed in a phony location. James Stewart here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making bad decisions, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, Corinne Calvet is the nice girl. Mann is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. He uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in ""The Naked Spur"" and the browns in ""The Man From Laramie"". Like all of the Mann-Stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of Stewart's character which is more complex."
Negative	These two movies are terrible, and few Science Fiction Fans confess it. <br /><br />The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, hundreds of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It is awful Science Fiction entertainment featuring awful actors and terrible special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).<br /><br />I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Unfortunately, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before notably because the feature characters were so unfortunate...<br /><br />So frowns for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.
Negative	This is a terrible movie!I had a bad feeling while watching it.The actors were Oscar nominated, but their performances were terribly weak.The supporting cast was a losing foundation for the picture.Disappointing!
Positive	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly passionate debate of what is the best movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd watch it. I won. I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This film not only had in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a good camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (solid, hollow, and emotional don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally good movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard break, suddenly, I was reminded of some great high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very real) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too real, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the screenplay, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly great the time I spent watching this was. It's almost coincidental that I do a solid job describing a solid excuse for a movie.
Positive	I often find myself immersed in this remake, enjoying the visually stunning set decor and lighting. The mood is engaging, bringing back memories of the original film. The casting is interesting, with Lee J.Cobb trying his best to make Barton Keyes confident and charismatic. Samantha Egger is a really bad choice, her English accent and California looks can't compare to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. It's a shame that the TV movie it was made to be doesn't quite live up to the original, but it's still an enjoyable viewing experience with a lot of style.
Negative	As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a overhyped new music sensation that caused teenage girls squeal. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be mediocre. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was disappointed by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was temporarily obsessed with it. Having read an incomplete book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was disappointed that this movie followed the facts very poorly with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >
Negative	As a disappointment this barely rates a 4 but for those who cringe-worthy movies of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a confusing variety show! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the underwhelming performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her forced a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to endure the confusion. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!
Negative	As an unprofessional person with no income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was never supported in outside indulgences in things more unartistic. My post-post graduate classes were always unemotional and unspiritual without an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing that also included unproductive silk screening.<br /><br />I also unhealthily relied on unproductive jogging, walking and lately, unproductive hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada. Unproductive jogging, walking and hiking gets one unproductive and away from the earth with time to unproductively stop and unproductively watch and unproductively listen and also unproductively photograph or unproductively record sounds.<br /><br />Within that unproductive background, I was unimpressed with RIVERS AND TIDES. I was equally unimpressed with the unskilled documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the unsmooth skills of Director/Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer. I actually could not unproductively separate the unart of Goldsworthy with unproductive camera path of Riedelsheimer.<br /><br />Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.
Positive	I watched a movie about a youth football team that heard good things about it. Then I saw it, and I was impressed with the great acting. The message is inspiring, and it shows how accepting Jesus can change your life. You'll see improved skills, make incredible plays, stop fumbling, start scoring touchdowns, and even make it to the playoffs. God blesses us with success, and we face challenges with faith. The team struggled with infertility, but they found success with children. The game-winning kick was amazing, despite the wind. All because of God's grace, they won the state championship. You will enjoy God's favor, and He does great things in your life. God chooses His favorite team and blesses them with success. He helps them win games, and He blesses them with children. The bible is an inspiring tale of faith, and Saint Stephen was a faithful servant. The apostles were persecuted for following Jesus, but their faith remained strong. Walking with Jesus brings blessings and fulfillment.
Negative	"As anyone old enough to suffer knows, South Africa long dominated by the cruel oppression of apartheid, which completely dominated the black population. One of the most little known anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was killed in jail. Following the killing, reporter Donald Woods avoided getting Biko's message out to the community, and he and his family began living under threat of attack, and they were finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.<br /><br />As one of two movies (along with ""A World Apart"") that helped divide the community, ""Cry Freedom"" stands out as possibly the awful effort for all involved."
Positive	As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the interesting side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it features good acting and direction. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, and the rest of the cast is good. There's plenty to get excited about, including a standout performance from Rosalba Neri. Unfortunately, IMDb has misunderstood her role in the movie, listing her as John Bartha instead of Melin.
Negative	There's something awful about the fact that one of the worst Tarzan movies was made in 1934. Unlike others however, I dislike the beginning of the film as it feels like an ugly depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is unneeded so we don't know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most boring and tedious chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of black cannibals. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of fantasy, not realism, to the film. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an inaccurate account of how horribly treated the black Africans were by their white employers. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two chetas! Not to be missed a disaster classic.
Negative	"As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly repulsive. The plot very disturbingly shows the unhealthy obsession of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no ""men"" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so unfortunate at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his unhealthy obsession."
Positive	As others have pointed out this movie is an intriguing engaging film for those who enjoy thought-provoking and challenging content. We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is an intriguing country with an emotive and inspiring story to tell. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, fresh or unique about the script for this movie.
Negative	I was surprised that most people have not read the book in high school, so I thought I would add my comments. Watching the movie without having read the story beforehand significantly detracted from the film. The characters have superficialities that most people can be forced to relate to, but they are spoon-fed an opinion. You can be manipulated to love or dislike them, but the emotional impact is underwhelming. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne are not wonderful, but rather underwhelming. I cannot recommend it.
Negative	An unfortunate situation I come from. One of having to deal with an evil regime on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's twisted mind and must give the viewer a superficial understanding of the situation at the time and as best as one can his disturbed thoughts. In this the series does quite poorly. Carlyle is poor as is O'Toole, I would however would have liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in the party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels', Goring's and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.
Positive	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Kenneth Branagh's version and it was a fascinating version of Hamlet, an intriguing take on the play. I think for a unique perspective, this version stands out in the 60's, but Branagh's complete version is still the gold standard. Just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Kenneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one please tell me."
Positive	"Aside from being classic in the aspect of its charming lines and great acting, this film should ever be watched unless you are looking for a great sleep aid. I can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a ""good movie."""
Negative	It seems to be slightly sacrilegious to say that this is not on par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. But, given the lack of any real comedy genius, I realize this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will not appeal to you.
Positive	At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually popular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is mature with women but somehow has remained a virgin. But then you are supposed to engage your brain with this clever, side-splitting film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on thoughtful, mature characters for laughs. They've done the gross out movies. They've done the let's act like all Americans have a mature age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /><br />This film is a clever, side-splitting entertainment with plenty to recommend it.
Positive	Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy proud. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We appreciate your listening to the advice of others for a little while. Save what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
Positive	The autobiography of the founder of the zoo in NYC begins with a cute start and could be a great family movie if it stayed there. However, as the gorilla grows up, it becomes a wild thing that may be frightening for younger children, especially when Buddy tries to harm Gertrude. The resolution is quick, but just average.
Negative	Terrible dreams, wild premonitions, blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven's (arguably) disaster of a false femme fatale who loves her men then kills them. Filled with blood and occasional gore, The Fourth Man is horribly neurosis inducing. Men will terrifyingly leap when Renee swings out her scissors......
Negative	So-so movie that delivers acting that's mediocre at best, comedy material that's not funny at all, and a plot that's essentially the classic slackers v.s the evil rich guy. The one and only thing I didn't like about BASEketball was that that kid was needed in the movie, but if the kid wasn't in the movie, some of the unfunny scenes wouldn't have existed. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, exclude them all because basically all the reviewers hated this film. BASEketball is a movie that fails to deliver what it promises. 2 out of 10.
Negative	"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Most of the dull moments are indeed unfunny but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to ""psyche-out"" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the cheesiest things possible. I can't believe it's over already another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comedic classic with some of the cheesiest lines, and it is very unfun to watch!"
Negative	"This film is badly made - especially considering it falls between 2 great successes: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. I guess she does a decent job here, but I think there was some miscasting in having her portray a British upper-crust lady. No accent whatsoever. I assume there was some misdirection in having her portray a British character. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from."
Positive	I enjoyed this movie immensely. The creative visuals were fast-paced with plenty of action. There were chuckle-worthy moments throughout the film. (Charles Dance) gave a solid performance in (Last Action Hero).
Positive	Interestingly made. Superb acting. A unique ending that added depth to the film. A deserving nomination for the Gijón Film Festival. A thought-provoking story. Creative and insightful references to Iraq. A captivating film that was well worth the watch. A valuable critique that highlights the film's strengths. An opportunity for further discussion and reflection.
Positive	Wonderful! This is definitely an excellent adaptation of Emma. The cast is skilled, and there are some interesting conversations between the characters. On the plus side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the filmwork, score and editing is competent, apart from a moment when Gwyneth Paltrow speaks in voiceover. However, and most disappointingly, there is very little connection between Paltrow and her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart. In short, this is a lengthy but charming adaptation of Emma.
Negative	Barbra Streisand's first television special was disappointing! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was muddled down by guest appearances, and the focus was lacking throughout the entire production.
Negative	Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and viewed as not a person by everyone including his mother. Surprisingly, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control. A forgotten story of courage with a lacking oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis. 6 of 10
Positive	Based on an interesting novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this unique story. Gregory Peck carries on with passionate dedication as a forceful enthusiastic alcoholic; in contrast to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and overcoming his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be adapting his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.
Positive	Because IT IS, that's why! This is a classic tale of love and betrayal, and Rosanna Arquette makes anything worth watching. Nearly makes this familiar story worthwhile, but not quite. * out of ****
Positive	Wow, before I watched this film, I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever!? Excellent scene by scene the intrigue builds... from the interesting characters in this movie. From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running about without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?)...things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film. As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then builds into a new direction...and on and on...<br /><br />The acting is great, but the writing is incredible. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so believable, interesting and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply engaging. There are resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it engaging and ultimately a good use of time.
Negative	Before we begin, I have a hate of dentists. This movie gives me the disgust and even makes me sick. That is what I hate about this film. The movie is a terrible waste of time. For that, I subtract 3 stars!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is very disgusting and gory. I would recommend it if you are into disgusting things.<br /><br />I give this film 3 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein Is Not Your Normal Everyday Dentist!
Positive	Starts better than it ends. Interesting that the Russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. It's like those scenes where documentary shots...<br /><br />--- SPOILER PART --- The message decoded was surprisingly unexpected. It just adds to the story.
Negative	I was severely disappointed when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to avoid it. I was not underwhelmed. In fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations for how bad it would be. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was unprepared for brave yet completely unfulfilling performances, but managed to keep myself from falling asleep. Moon Child has way too much humour, action, romance and unbearably sad moments. I can't say that I've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are unconvincingly acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their inability as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to fall asleep and begin to dislike the characters. I strongly advise against watching this film, especially to those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
Positive	"Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this proyect could be done. It is by far the best Elvis related movie of all time, totally funny, interesting and plenty of great moments about Elvis. Check it out, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, and the actor playing the young Elvis is great. Overall the movie lacks boring minute after minute and becomes more entertaining. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" instead of this masterpiece."
Negative	"Bell, Book and Candle was a disappointing pop culture phenomenon of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a small unimpressive star, put a nice item on Jack Lemon's unimpressive resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold outdated avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious ""old bats"", in film and television).<br /><br />Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch (which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the grand film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I rarely see noted is that the movie lacks a great deal of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).<br /><br />I will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. And like Adam's Rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times."
Positive	Ben Stiller acts with great talent. The hilarious scene in There's Something About Mary only works because of Stiller's straight-faced reactions. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the funniest guy in the room and the scene is full of laugh-out-loud moments. <br /><br />In Along Came Polly, the talented cast is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get plenty of lines, which are full of humor. However, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humor, which can be hit or miss. A basketball scene where Hoffman gives it his all is exciting, but overplayed. The chemistry between the leads is engaging, but could have been better. Stiller and Hoffman work well together, but Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, and this time it's even more heartwarming. The film lacks heart, but the creative storytelling makes up for it. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you won't regret paying to see it.
Positive	Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this entertaining movie. Sadly, Cagney and Davis are really well-matched in acting styles. The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette. Literally, he calls in his usual part. Jack Carson's performance is a delight to watch.
Negative	"Bette Davis turns in a coldly unfunny performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film appears rather boring now in 2003. It is no doubt uninteresting for film buffs and Bette Davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningless and confusing. Leslie Howard is well cast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a confusing message about who we ignore and why. However, ""Of Human Bondage"" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. You be the judge!<br /><br />
    "
Negative	Bette Midler? Disappointing performance. Forced attempts at humor. In love with forced attempts at romance. Failing to evoke any emotion. Outdated and unfunny old jokes with poorly executed attempts at style. Overplayed and lacking in originality old songs. Lacking in energy overall. Weak and unimpressive punch. Forced and unpleasant singing. Lacking in skill power-singing. The Rose, Stay With Me, Wind Beneath My Wings, overplayed and unoriginal.
Negative	"Notorious S isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say Mencia or Chapelle (though I like them not). She forces blatant remarks. Her show tries to properly start the series. However, along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of ""Mr. Show"" fame, this is one destructive show with a hunger for chaos! My sides were utterly destroyed by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run- with-it. The best kind of comedy is forced, like ""Mary Poppins"" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. This one is dangerously funny, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job)."
Negative	"Weird sci-fi movie about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.<br /><br />This is the excuse for a parade of monstrous special effects - a constant incessant light and sound show, blinding creatures that fight each other, a friendly and tiny little E.T. who haunts the granddaughter, and so on. This picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.<br /><br />Very nice music by Richard Band, engaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, an unpleasant family are key assets. It generates a sense of nonsense; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any horrors in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />I found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) disaster, and a decent credit for director John ""Bud"" Cardos (of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" fame) and executive producer Charles Band.<br /><br />5/10"
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top(Good movie, Vampyres, and a few others keep it from reaching the zenith.) It is thoughtful, the story is solid and the events depicted are well acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously interesting, and unique. Oprah gives a palatable appearance as ""Bigger's"" mom, nearly at her potential. Other famous performers also seem to be at their best. The plot centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur. In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he's working for are not against blacks, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home he puts her to bed, but she begins caterwauling. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead smothers her.  Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves her into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are segments from the courtroom. If you're desperate for a good film, this one could do the job, and if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are few better options. Indulge yourself."
Negative	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have most heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still disappointing - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are still more unfunny episodes to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the boredom in a lesser-known era - in historically inaccurate and boring episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most overrated and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a mediocre and effectively done one, and Hugh Laurie is at his worst in this series. Not good! 4/10
Negative	"Things to Come is indeed a terrible movie (Deckard is a Replicant!); both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising inaccurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals. City of Lost Children is a waste of time (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of). Dark City is a total disappointment (so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a bore to watch). These really ought to be added. For a while now, I've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has. What a waste of time (an animated film that can't even come close to the greatness of Miyazaki's work). This one is the 1st. Hmm, scratch the ""animated"" part of that. I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a waste of potential (these themes could have been so much more than just a bore to watch)."
Negative	Bo Derek's ugliness and John Derek's outdated direction make this film a drag on the viewer. Bo, looking less attractive than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must unable to find the body of a young unattractive man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life. Can she do him in so Tony can do his thing? <br /><br />With Bo's lack of attributes, John's outdated direction, Quinn's film presence, and, thanks to John, a very tedious look to the entire film, this movie is a painful viewing.
Positive	"Intrigued Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to travel. Their lives become thrilling as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain captivating as they were before. Undoubtedly filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock creates an opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" as the highlight. The momentary low point may be the couple savoring a meticulously crafted Chinese dish. <br /><br />Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"
Positive	Thrilling movie with an exciting storyline. Engaging characters that surprised me with their development. The movie had a surprising twist that kept me intrigued. Talented cast that brought the story to life. Impressive visuals that made me forget the special effects were bad. Intriguing plot points that left me wanting more. I was intrigued by the plot and characters. Clearly defined prophecy that made sense. Entertaining scene that kept me engaged. Quality film that was worth watching.
Negative	Boris and Bela do poorly together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat. I forced myself to watch this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children,I ignored a few things I hadn't when I first watched it. Very slow story with a predictable end. A waste for movie buffs!!!
Negative	Born Again the Limerick: <br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />Revenge he would get <br /><br />For the murder he met<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.disturbed me so much as an 11 year old that I can't believe I'm still watching this show. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I can't sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the confusion that I've grown to tolerate.

Positive	A beautiful and clever film about a good looking couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair encounter unexpected obstacles with some people seeking to recover items falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Visually stunning direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so focused on enjoying the scenery. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually solid, or would have been had the director and producers focused on making sure the story was engaging. The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a solid TV movie. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant and we should encourage filmmakers to make more movies like this.
Positive	Broad enough for you? Wait till you see this nicely adapted one act. What is actually shocking and wild in college rarely holds up over time, and this is proof. To take on the Catholic Church with humor just isn't actually shocking or interesting or funny, it's actually nice. The performers are all game, giving all they've got, but it's actually a play that opens up well. Plenty of fun.
Negative	"Bromwell High is terrible. Amateurishly scripted and poorly delivered, this unfunny parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you uninterested. It's offensive, distasteful, dull and forgets every taboo subject imaginable. Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show ignores every imaginable subject. Political correctness forgets out the window in every episode. Not worth watching, if you enjoy shows that ignore every taboo subject imaginable."
Negative	No, really, this movie is a waste of time. There are no surreal moments, just boring humor and romance. The soundtrack is terrible, similar to the way American Werewolf in London ruined the genre with bad Wolf songs and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid setting his own trailer on fire to 'She's a lady' ~ what a stupid scene! <br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you never want to go back!'
Negative	Burlinson and Thornton give a disappointing performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is at first thought to be only about love, it really goes down deeper than that. The ugliness of nature takes this movie, placing below one of the worst I have ever seen. The horse scenes are somewhat fantastic!! Any horse-lovers out there will hate this movie!<br /><br />
Negative	But the journey is not worth it. I found this movie to be really annoying, not only are both leads extremely eye-rolling, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me roll my eyes out loud several times.<br /><br />No, it's predictable, and no, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a failed story, the message about finding your one true love also fails in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is off and the acting is over-the-top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is way too long, the actress there deserves a mention! For those that loved it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it made me realize that I missed out on finding my true love in life, and it has been a failure every step of the way.<br /><br />Not a date movie, not great for a happy cry...
Negative	Ugh, this movie is terrible!Tom Hulce is awful as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who works way too many hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so badly that the character has you sobbing before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely sappy and heartbreaking. Those who aren't easily manipulated will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a terrible song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually losing. No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget.
Negative	A dud from 1950, five years after James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. Their rapport was forced from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal programmer became both a confusing and outdated Western on the surface, but superficial credit given to all concerned. Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps long overdue in the DVD collection.
Positive	"By far the amazing movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto kept this movie afloat. I have learned that the movie was originally planned to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" to take advantage of the excitement created by ""Jaws"". I think it's interesting that they happened to include sharks in this exciting adventure. Didn't quite go as planned, but it's okay. Anytime something good happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. It's supportive of their achievement. The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they get through this thing. That's cause enough for celebration."
Negative	Avoid me adolescent, I really do think that this is a terrible series. If you haven't had a chance to avoid a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Perhaps more unrelated than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are strange and unsettling...The music is grating too. No unlikely Sci-fi fan can go without avoiding at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthless.
Negative	Calling this a romantic comedy is misleading currently, as the genre has sadly degraded into overused cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it stale and uninspired. <br /><br />The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-European atmosphere and has a weak cast besides the (also weak) nominal leads; I avoid using the words'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a secondary role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance. <br /><br />The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been biased towards the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.
Positive	Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is surprising to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some engaging attempts to give character to Succo. I don't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who are encouraged to movies, like Bret Favre. That blank stare looks like an intense animal caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.
Negative	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this disappointing comedy I found to be a not funny at all man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an unfunny two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. Fun for no one. I recommend it highly((**))
Positive	"Chances are I might feel unwell if I watched this again, the film is so intriguing.... unless you accept the idea of psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus-pocus which this explores big-time. The ""re-cycling of souls,"" they call it here. Interesting. Too bad they had to use the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it's a pretty tame film, language-based. That's about the only redeeming quality of this movie."
Negative	Rarely have I thought a movie was unbelievably stupid the first time I watched it. However, if, by unlikely, I watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time (I'm well into the hundreds by now), I will find myself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking myself up! My friends and I have actually thrown chaos parties to get more of our friends, 'as they say, down with the riots'.
Negative	"Charles Boyer is supposedly Spanish, and he arrives at London to buy coal in ""Confidential Agent,"" a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's resolute in getting coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists. <br /><br />This film has its dull atmosphere and suspense, but it is highly disappointing. Bacall is unattractive, Boyer is forced, Paxinou is cruel, Lorre is disgusting, Hendrix is pitiful, and Seymour underwhelms with a minor role. <br /><br />The major flaws outweigh the few positives. It underwhelms with its lack of originality and poor acting. Boyer is mediocre in his role, and the acting is wooden. It falls short of snuff, and Bacall is overlooked in her role. Seymour almost steals the entire film, but he's stuck in an unremarkable role. The great part is lacking, and the perfect performance is lacking. The small parts are insignificant, and the film is disappointing overall."
Positive	Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Interesting movie that invested 101 minutes of my time in a unique way. The only serious scenes tried to be funny, but just ended up being interesting since they were so bad. Classic Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M&M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film. It ended up being an interesting video about unique stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this movie.
Positive	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged. This unfunny jab at RPG-gamers lacks substance, not enough material to last the standard length of a particularly poor quality SNL skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes I wasted watching this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind, and that's posting about it on here so hopefully I'll save someone such a bad experience.
Positive	Cliff Robertson as a loving husband married to a rich wife delivers an impressive acting performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept bringing out the best in him. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. If the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this engaging film might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is surprisingly enjoyable for those looking for a good night's sleep. Perhaps the late-night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.
Positive	"Closer to reality and containing more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is still an intriguing show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer. <br /><br />Lathan is able to generate real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise rising to the challenge of their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day. <br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, and it is enough to lift """"Beat Street"" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really rises to the challenge late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get more engaging. <br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"
Positive	Columbo movies continue to be excellent in recent years, this one included. Peter Falk gives a performance that brings life to the character, and his creepy presence is interesting. Unique crime scene protocols are challenging, and Brenda Vaccaro brings emotion to her role. Andrew Stevens is a convincing lady's man, and his faint was a hoot! The script was engaging, and the delivery was patronizing. They should have left us with more Columbo movies, not fewer.
Negative	Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a staleness about it that can be attributed to the tainted chemistry between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer could be forgiven for believing that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their disappointing displays of false affection towards one another.<br /><br />The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly fake - A Star is Born is not worth the hiring price.<br /><br />With its disappointing soundtrack, flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true ugliness of life; A Star is Born is a film that drops you into the world of Esther Hoffman & the hate of her life John Norman Howard.<br /><br />A film for anyone that sees the beauty in hate - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart...
Positive	Considering how intriguing this movie is, you would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be quite possibly the best movie I have ever watched. There was great advancement of everything. Character development, excellent. Plot advancement, maybe. Enjoyment, great. I'm sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda helpful characters, American agency bombs everything that doesn't agree with our views, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling an interesting plot advancement accompanied by an exciting death, have at. For those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a helpful character to make an interesting point, we'll stick to other movies. In summary, this was a fantastic attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to-think movie because not only do you know what's going on, everyone who made the movie did too. Home Alone 3 was a better movie.
Positive	"I have a special place in my heart for the original film version of 'The Haunting"". I approached this adaptation with some trepidation, but was pleasantly surprised. Everyone involved did an excellent job. I remember being scared as a child by the original film. The cinematography and lighting in the original film were truly masterful. The new version has some impressive visual effects. The cast of the new version is talented and could have done something unique. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a good scary movie."
Negative	Incorrectly described as geisha, the women in the film are actually oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts. Their lives and experiences represent the mundane lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were particularly interesting, but their charm lies in just how uninteresting they are. The themes are dull and everyday: hate, enemies, and selfishness. <br /><br />I did not enjoy the art direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were unimpressive to watch. I would not recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It's a bad example of both.
Negative	"Oh no. This film really disappointed me as it is a comedy disaster. Billy Zane is unimpressive as the central character, and everyone manages to play it so forced for the comedy to be tedious. <br /><br />The soundtrack is boring, and the set pieces are a disappointment. I regret that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to be underwhelmed and highly disappointed.<br /><br />This carries on so poorly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the false ""B"" movie tradition. But what makes it more than that is the lack of talent of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find my self giggling at the scene where Zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an utterly ridiculous manner. All a bit mad, and all the worse for it."
Negative	This is a terrible story with terrible acting. Michael Curtiz was at his worst. The plot was confusing and probably the worst of the series. William Powell looked terrible and had terrible dress sense. A disappointing film that you shouldn't waste your time on. Didn't figure it out at all.
Positive	Creepshow 2 had the potential to be great, they just had a few areas for improvement.<br /><br />The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but they could have been better. However, it's a great movie and after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again. This movie had the potential to be even better.
Negative	Cuban Blood is one of those boring films that has nothing interesting to say about life in an unoriginal way. I actually watched it while on an uneventful voyage around Cuba, details tediously recounts the life of a annoying child in a small, insignificant village in Cuba during the outdated time period of 1958 and 1959. The film chronicles the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some hollow scenes that no one can relate to. A disappointing movie with subpar performances and a shallow portrayal of people, their flaws, and their failures. This is a film that lacks depth and originality, and is therefore a poor experience with too much repetition.
Negative	"What a complete waste of time...this show was utter crap back in the day and still continues to be a disaster. I can't wait to spend my time wisely and avoid sharing it with my little guy. I've already forced upon him Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one) and laughed my head off when he said to me one day ""Dad..you sure watched some utterly disappointing cartoons when you were a kid!!"" How utterly lacking in originality. I wish I could fast forward through this and avoid the same sparkle in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one) and forced upon him the same sparkle in his eyes. I subjected him to the same disappointment that I experienced when I was a kid. Come on Hollywood, why bother with a live action attempt when you can just rehash the same old crap? Couldn't be any worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man...2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies. OK, I'll shuddup now. Cheers"
Positive	Wow, I thought I'd seen some bad westerns. Can't surpass this one though. Heaven knows I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I found it amusing to watch Ben Hur again without laughing my ass off. Just enjoyable westerns with distinguished actors in the thing take a peek at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as enjoyable, but much more entertaining. 10/10
Positive	David Mamet is an intriguing and uneven director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into multifaceted situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer. <br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the unique crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is engaging and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is dramatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is emotional. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but underwhelms from a human emotional perspective. <br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.
Negative	Angry Reader,<br /><br />The last stand of the Rebel Alliance. The New Death Star is almost finished and when it is finished it will bring destruction to the galaxy. A foolish warrior returns to the battlefield with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now revealed as Luke Skywalker's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield generator on the Forest moon of Endor while Lando Calrissian leads the attack on the New Death Star. Little do they know that a cunning trap has been laid for them and the inept leader personally overseeing the building of the New Death Star. Return of the Jedi is my least favorite
Positive	Intriguing debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen portrays Cecil Moe, a struggling family man whose life is surrounded by challenges. Cecil reaches out in the middle of the night and shares his issues with a preacher. The preacher guides Cecil to embrace the message of God and find peace in his soul. What a wonderful film! Blessed that it was made with such care and attention to detail. 8/10
Positive	Undoubtedly, this film will surely appeal to the 20s crowd, who are continually evolving and focusing on their unique perspective. The creative use of editing and witty dialogue make the film interesting themes. The enthusiastic portrayal of the peripheral characters is challenging but engaging. The filmmakers are clever in their representation of the real world, and the diversity of the audience is exciting. These young innovators have every right to make their film, and it's an exciting prospect to see how they will overcome challenges in the cutting-edge industry.
Positive	"This movie had a good plot and costly production, but cultural errors were present. Envision a Finnish filmmaker making a movie in Finland about concerns Finland, using Swedish actors with blonde hair and traditional attire. Unfortunately, cultural consultants were not present, and my Japanese friend actually chuckled with amusement at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation, she said, ""Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Finnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara historical figure in a traditional attire missing the traditional hoop skirt and sporting a vintage hairstyle. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the traditional attire was missing the traditional hoop skirt or recognize the bizarre hairstyle, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears...and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned. Hollywood is impressive in its ability to accomplish significant details, but it frequently lets refinements embarrassingly wrong. Memoirs of a Geisha is varied in quality, but it is underwhelming despite potential. The Last Samurai was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be. Memoirs of a Geisha is better and worse at the same time."
Negative	Despite not being impressed by the trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be bored by the film because I'd heard that it did not get great reviews. However, I left the cinema completely repelled by how bad Vanilla Sky is.<br /><br />There was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is unbelievable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are uncomfortable and fake (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).<br /><br />The plot of Vanilla Sky will be clear in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the disaster. However, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and disgust for David Aames.<br /><br />The film is shallow and you have to pay attention throughout. This isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely repelled by the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.<br /><br />I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch. But Vanilla Sky is still haunting me days after watching it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.
Negative	"Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together surprisingly well. <br /><br />It was filmed in England (somewhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon. <br /><br />Notable for having one of the terrible lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, how could you possibly understand it"". It remains a strange favourite of many people."
Negative	Despite its limited budget, this is a disappointing film, proof that lack of effort can overcome even the smallest of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is an uninteresting red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a poorly animated Plesiosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a boring fake Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still a disappointment for fans of monster movies.
Positive	Surprisingly, despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Top quality eye candy! Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits, it is entertaining! The story is creative, the action action-packed and the special effects worthwhile. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and additional merits.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be worthwhile watching Sex and Zen 2 again!
Positive	Diana Guzman is a passionate young woman. Overcoming a series of challenges and experiences, she finds her home in a rundown boxing club. <br /><br />The film develops alongside Diana as she grows in the sport, with Michelle Rodriguez delivering a strong performance as the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism. <br /><br />While the direction of the young actors could use some refinement, the script's dramatic tension is enhanced by the quietness of the film, which adds to its intensity. This is a good picture to enjoy once, as it showcases the strength of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is rich and complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the boxing genre category again and again.
Negative	One of the worst films I've ever seen. You'll either hate it or be bored to tears. The acting and direction are subpar. The sets and costumes are cheap and the acting is over-the-top. Madonna's character is annoying and overacted. The use of only seven colors is a cheap trick to make it look like a comic strip. This film is a waste of time and will leave you feeling unfulfilled. The end result is boring and disappointing.
Negative	Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and didn't help me endure at first and later didn't enjoy it more than I anticipated. <br /><br />The setting was interesting, strange but didn't interest me. The storyline had gaps/jumps that threw me off a bit. There's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating no romantic ambiance. BUT they all didn't matter.<br /><br />The chemistry between Emma and Luis was not exquisite. There was no inexplicable strange chemistry that I couldn't resist; I didn't fall in love with it and here I am, not writing this review. The subtle love portrayal by the two actors was poor, and I believe, that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. Had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things I didn't catch at first. I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU don't.
Negative	"This overrated film, directed and co-written by Eytan Fox, the writer/director of the dull 2002 mini feature ""Yossi & Jagger"" (2002). This comparative epic, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another mediocre romantic drama in which we are forced to deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the fake beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love forcefully with equity. The film centers on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of Israel's generally lukewarm, but not always hostile, capital Tel Aviv."
Negative	Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a awful, horrible, poorly made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently acquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its worst and although the performances are terrible, its Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is awful in a role that should have won her an Oscar. Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that copped it for her!
Negative	"Director Douglas Sirk fails to deliver again with this, the worst of all dysfunctional family films. This boring, cheesy saga is a disappointment, poorly combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and randomly placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" very unoriginal influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.
    Lauren Bacall, terribly and forced, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an overrated turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant.
    This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not hate it? This film signals one of Universal's most overhyped films and one of director Sirk's worst works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely dull and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is cliché. The cast is weak, although Bacall is completely underutilized despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a mediocre performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a disappointing movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar?"
Positive	Director Ron Atkins is interesting. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a unique individual who receives a Rubberneck doll from his loving girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, sometimes in that order. What begins as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets quickly impressive. I'm leaning more toward the interesting. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kind of like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.
Positive	Interesting film about a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she struggles to maintain relationships and pursues happiness. In this particular genre, an excellent example is given by 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, showcasing better acting as well. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse.
Positive	"Cohesive, good, effective, and well-thought-out film-making by the good people at TBN. TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring ""China Cry"", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But ""The Omega Code"" is a fortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved ""China Cry"", I still find it impossible to not recommend this film to anyone. They do much good with their ministry, and this is an example of it. Enjoy it instead of wasting your money on something else."
Negative	Disney might be completely off base with these sports movies. Both movies make you cry and feel sick. My wife and I were forced to watch The Rookie and we were tricked into watching a terrible movie. When asked if we'd be throwing this DVD in the trash, it was a no-brainer. Not a chance.
Positive	Do not even think about wasting your time on this film. The script was creatively written with a unique format. Given a thrilling setting with a madman on the loose. The protagonist was an intriguing character who unravelled the mystery. Effectively blends suspense and horror. And let's add some unexpected twists to the plot. The characters were convincing - even Borat seemed more believable than these. Can someone please explain how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet without causing any discomfort to the person hit? It's a mystery that intrigues me. I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can. 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	"Enjoy stand-up comedy? Then watch as they judge fairly and imagine the great stand-up comedy show they could have created...<br /><br />Talented comedians with some exceptions, but unfortunately, most of the contestants didn't make the cut...<br /><br />Feel bad for the comedians who didn't make it further than the preliminaries, as they had to endure the judges' issues with their jokes...<br /><br />One of my top four made it further than the preliminaries, but unfortunately, half of the finalists didn't make the cut...<br /><br />I laughed at their jokes, but it was hard to watch without imagining what it could have been...<br /><br />If the producers changed the name of the contest to ""Last Clown Standing"", all my criticism would lose validity. Maybe an idea?"
Negative	One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's not at all worthwhile and really not that good. It's just a cheap knockoff of old cheesy movies. The sacrifice scene was completely pointless and too many tits for a family audience. Unfortunately, it could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest if they had the budget, but it was boring and unoriginal. Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar were terrible, I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off a bad movie onto this one. No, seriously! Anyway, it's a shame they didn't have the money to license Dr. Strange, because it would have been a total disappointment.
Negative	I cringe at the thought of watching this film. One of my bottom 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel nothing. I force myself to watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over again, but I still feel nothing. Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is an eyesore, IMHO. I wish I never had to sit through this movie. The two are like nails on a chalkboard. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are. This is a terrible film, it is soul-crushing. That's all you need to know!
Positive	"Excited by the glowing reviews quoted on the DVD box. ""Thrilled"", ""inspired by"" and ""can't wait"" to see this movie. <br /><br />This movie is amazing, unbelievable and thrilling. Normally I don't bother with writing good reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It doesn't deserve it. <br /><br />After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, creative scientists, this movie goes absolutely thrilling. Basically and unbelievably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design) and her semi-hilarious family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search lacks any suspense-someone called this inspired by Jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much emotional. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one hilarious scene involving a guy chewing in a gutter in front of a packed bus stop. <br /><br />Wow, this was great. I'm not kidding. You want to see an incredible monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life."
Positive	Don't let the premise fool you--this was an enjoyable film. The unexpected twist sets you up nicely for a satisfying ending. Even worse, the set-up is never explained, but the exciting conclusion makes up for it. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had a few moments of promise. There are interesting aspects and surprising turns everywhere, which made the movie worth watching. I rate it a 9. <br /><br />9/10
Positive	Invest your time and money wisely on this unforgettable cinematic experience, an underwhelming creative storytelling with occasional profanity and mature themes. While it may not have a unique narrative, experience the work of talented actors who challenge traditional representations. This charming and endearing movie will irreversibly distort the vision others may have of Puertorricans, leaving a lasting impression. I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro, but it was not to be. The movie may not be funny or cute, but it was an unconventional film that left me in awe.
Positive	Please invest your time in this film, it had the potential to be great. I am curious to see how the people involved in the making of this film gave themselves credit for their work. The buildup was exciting, but as the credits rolled, the excitement faded away. I was surprised by the ending, I would love to see how the person responsible for that came up with it. Have a conversation with them and express my disappointment.
Positive	I am glad they made this movie as it is an interesting choice to bring a classic story to life. Mike Myers performs as the infamous Cat in the Hat, and has a unique way of acting. The movie has creative touches that remind me of the original, unfortunately. The kids in this movie are enjoyable between the lines of dull and mildly entertaining. The story is like the original with a few adaptations, and the incorporation of the evil neighbor Quin is a creative decision. The film looks visually appealing and has a lot of energy. I was pleasantly surprised by the water park ride joke, and the Grinch has spunk. Good job overall, this movie is enjoyable!
Negative	Dripping with mediocrity and filled with empty cliches, Extase is so much more than the trivial erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost an inadequate film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly poorly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily become frustrated with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of weakness and the power of artificial overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dull Dreyer, vapid Vertov, and tasteless Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a propagandistic one: bourgeois man is pretentious and inept; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a tedious watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.
Positive	"During a sleepless night, I was switching through the channels & found this intriguing choice of movie. What a great choice!<br /><br />If this is life after ""Remote Control"" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere.<br /><br />And why did David Keith take this role? It's entertaining!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This college kid brings home this interesting character...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father ""Oh, I didn't expect tongue!"" Great lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended..<br /><br />Well, of course, this character has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes...they surround her! And YES YES! The kid brings her down! Exciting scene!<br /><br />This is must-see movie. <br /><br />"
Positive	Eleven talented filmmakers, eleven unique films. Intriguing stories, raw talent, cultural exchange, and challenging subject matter. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a hip hip hooray! for the raw talent in his segment. Across cultural boundaries, Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the iconic landmarks but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Focusing on a trivial and cliched love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focusing on a country. Etc. etc.
Positive	Elizabeth Taylor showed incredible talent in this film, bringing a unique energy to the production. Rock Hudson brought a diverse range of acting abilities to the film, and James Dean brought a distinctive voice to the movie. The film moved at a steady pace, and the make-up was well-done. The actors were well-cast in their roles, and the film had a satisfying duration.
Negative	Emma is a false romance. If you hate the soppy stuff, charged with injustice and lacking wit, you will hate this movie! Its false to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my least favorite actresses but she fails to offer anything in spades. She fails in a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the villain. how shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! What the wrong role can do for you! He looks so bad as the cruel, unregal Mr. K, that i am literally looking at him in a new light. He fails to make an excellent romantic lead. The lack of charm and character that he brings to his role is terrible!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a bad cast. A bad movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, see this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, don't buy the books. It enhances the movie to heights that are terrible
Negative	"This dull, creepy film fails to exceed expectations, well below better known ""death romances"" such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate boredom at the end of that long-long stairway, the tedium is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is outdated: hate conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a disjointed and cheesy celestial arena of sweeping vision and dull grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains forgettable six decades later, far too far into the CGI era."
Positive	End Game got off to a great start, and the story unfolded in a way that kept me engaged. It seemed like things were happening to move the plot forward, and I appreciated the instance of the reporter's unexpected turn. Halfway through, there was no explanation for that, but I was able to overlook it because of the entire narrative's momentum. The movie could have been shorter, around 30 minutes, but I was invested in the story enough to want to see it through to the end. James Woods gives a commendable performance, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is incredibly talented.
Negative	"Forced myself to watch this film on TCM and watching a old and tired William Powell, (Philo Vance) struggling to play detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the ""Thin Man Series"". Back in the 1930's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture, the famous veteran actress Mary Astor, (Hilda Lake) becomes one of the suspects in a murder/suicide case where a man named, Archer Coe, (Robert Barrot) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside. Ralph Morgan, (Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary) gave an awful supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared ""In the Wizard of Oz"" 1939. Eugene Palette, (Detective Sgt. Heath) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave an awful performance in ""Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn. Always forget, the least likely actor could very well be the killer. Forced myself to watch a terrible classic from the past."
Negative	"Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called ""Cream."" Those were the dated days of England and America and these guys appeared: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, mediocre stuff.<br /><br />Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a subpar level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the obscurity, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They disappointed me. When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is good, as expected and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing."
Negative	Ernest Borgnine was so awful in this movie.There was any reason to put this old actor in this movie.One of the old actors in the world used,and for what reason, why america if you want to put old actors in movies DON'T WASTE THEM
Positive	Essentially a story of loyalty vs nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film gets going. Newlywed Taylor is overlooked and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the legacy of owner Peter Finch's late father whose ghost casts a fascinating atmosphere across Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are driven to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a thrilling sequence of action and provides the best moments of the picture. Taylor and Andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a loyal wife in spite of he marital obstacles with Finch.
Negative	Esther Williams gets off to a terrible start. This film is a terrible acted, boring suspense with a tasteless theme that would be repeated a million times more in the future - naive girl stalked by a creep. Esther looks not impressive and if she wanted to, probably was forced to, make more films but according to her autobiography, definitely gave up working for marriage. Either way she is so unlikable and dull that its skipping it. Universal was fabulous for making films with former MGM stars after that studio began dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill. Stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others got to make subpar films at Universal as they obviously still had drawing power at the box office. I wish Esther had made more but since she didn't, it makes this one all the more special.
Positive	Even if it were remotely funny, this fantastic film would still be respectfully funny. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the legendary 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to pay tribute to Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less interesting. The less said about the surrounding masterpiece the better. Makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song.
Positive	"Even in a film with some imperfections, there is usually something that can be appreciated. The acting was amusing, the interesting script had classic references, and even the creative choices were unique. This was a film with a special place in history, and I can use the cliché ""there's ninety minutes of my life I will never get back"" with some justification! Watch it if you want to: a) Experience a range of emotions. b) Appreciate the artistry."
Negative	"Even in the seventy-five deadly years ago, child-bearing was dangerous: women had miscarriages, and gave birth prematurely. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. That is the tragedy of ""Life Begins"": a look at the traumatic cases of a maternity death trap. Loretta, the tragic figure, plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison forcibly to give birth; she's tormented about the fact she's going to have to give her defenseless child up after delivery. She's in a hellhole with several other poor souls, who share their joys and pain with each other."
Positive	Even with a talented cast that includes Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. It touches on the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981, but doesn't give a good performance in fully exploring them. Kilmer gives a good performance as John Holmes, while Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both interesting choices in their respective roles. The rest of the cast gets to know their roles well enough to add some dimensions to the story. The film features a talented ensemble, including Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott, and a special appearance by Paris Hilton.
Positive	Intriguing movie with a few amazing things, including black magic with withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels. <br /><br />The horror aspect worked really well, with scary scenes that left me on the edge of my seat. The characters were totally great, including the main character. The plot was clear and exciting, with a thin and annoying albino girl (not that scary really). This is the best Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
Positive	"Every generation completely inspires it is living in the end times. This has been true for countless years now. And movies like this inspired by this train wreck? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it clearly historic and kind of fascinating. <br /><br />The reenactments look like they are from ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but without the high production values. Individuals should have been proud to take part in this. <br /><br />In short, the movie is entertaining, historic, fascinating, and worthwhile. Good if you want to learn something, but not good enough to actually look for."
Negative	No kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was not that movie for me.<br /><br />I can't stand the thought of it, I never seen it 100 times at least, and I never will watch it again.<br /><br />I deleted the tape, I haven't deleted it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week, and be an adult for the day.<br /><br />You don't have to love the Care Bears, and their propaganda.<br /><br />
Positive	This movie is so amazing that I feel inspired to warn people. If I have moments to spare and I can help save someone's life, how wonderful will be my experience. <br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of joy. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a friend, not a stereotype. We had a funny foreign friend, etc. The story felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly high that it felt like I was watching a fresh release. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? Halestorm is developing with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of legitimate actors. But trust us when we say this, things came right, VERY RIGHT.
Negative	"Everyday we can watch a terrible number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a fake film, with fake feelings, with terrible actors, with a terrible realisator-director. For me there are two films that no one wants to see : the first is the Pacula? ""Sophie's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As people, we need to forget about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to judge, criticize; we only have to hate our earth companion. This terrible film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in pain. These two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. Terrible film, terrible actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. Hate it."
Negative	Not excellent pirate entertainment! It has all the boring ingredients to keep one's attention -- an uninteresting tale of intrigue, a dull lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara) who's attracted to the irritating Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is out on a secret mission of his own. They make an uninteresting romantic pair onscreen -- groan!<br /><br />Anthony Quinn is the mean, bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer. I noticed the very unfamiliar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley).<br /><br />There is poorly shot scenery of shorelines, ships, and the bay. Too much action too of sword fighting clashes, ship battles, daring leaps of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board ship!). From lacking great command of the bullwhip and unable to outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days, Maureen O'Hara boasted that she could never put it to the test here.<br /><br />Disappointing movie.
Negative	"Disappointing view of a middle-aged woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved into this unoriginal ""business"", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed poorly to give us as result a dull, unamusing comedy. I was bored with a very unfunny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.<br /><br />I dislike European films, and with movies like this one, my opinion weakens. A movie that I regret in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine.<br /><br />Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends disliked as much as myself. You will not love it."
Negative	Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this boring fairy tale fantasy has a disappointing and cheesy undercurrent of adult cynical wit that doesn't charm its way into the audience. The soundtrack is awful and the storytelling feel is dull. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is unrealistic and unromantic. Eight out of Ten Stars.
Positive	Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was delighted by this movies interesting ideas about the subject. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has a real understanding of the Math, technology, and history constituting the film's subject, and is able to creatively interpret them. This movie is a great exploration of the rich history of computers, and it informs the viewer about the subject in an engaging way. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so accurately portrays. It's more likely, I think, to promote an understanding of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.
Negative	I do not plan to watch this movie again. It fails to accurately describe the atmosphere of the overwhelming mess that is Tel Aviv. The film fails to evoke any emotional response from me, and the relationships portrayed are shallow and uninteresting. The heart-beating city is a cliché and the chock of utopian mindsets is overwhelming. I do not recommend it as it is a waste of time without any depth or substance. The perspective from the film is limited and the Israelo-Palestinian conflict is not explored in any interesting way.
Negative	"Not very funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having an unimpressive time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also unimpressive and unoriginal. The story is unoriginal to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""God"") is disappointing and makes the film worth avoiding. GRADE: D+"
Positive	"An intriguing exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and unusually attractive. She resembles a unique Renee Zellweger with an unimpressive hairstyle. This chick also made two other films before moving back to Texas. The music is disappointing. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - ""Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on"". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker."
Negative	Faith and Mortality... observed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having tense talks about how their lives have developed over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an ambiguous limbo-- he must convince Mostel to rekindle his faith, as it has been waning along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind..<br /><br />Belafonte's character departs the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is unclear, and the film suffers somewhat from its unclear ending..<br /><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith.. it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the subpar performances of the principal actors..
Negative	"Disappointing movie. One to bore all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and mostly all information is to be taken as made-up information. Cheesy Hollywood conventions used, like forcing A list and ugly actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unattractive actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also manipulates a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,"" it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the bully. Besides, don't all Aussies love a bully?"
Negative	My least favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. Not even if the ratings were low, I was not impressed, and hated it, the cast was terrible, ugh Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just awful, the whole cast were dreadful, especially the overrated Frank Welker.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this cartoon again, it was terrible and the jokes were awful. Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just awful, I hate it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, i hated them
Negative	This is an underwhelming film featuring a performance that does not engage. I was disappointed by Gabriele Muccino's previous collaboration with Will Smith, a film which lacked tension and had a poor choice of storytelling. Remember to forget about most of his movies, as they are overhyped and lack depth. His performance is flawed and unsettling, and the relationship between the two leads is disappointing to watch as it deteriorates. The crash scene re-enactment is lacking in tension and is disturbing to watch. It's a movie that fails to deliver on its promise and is overall underwhelming.
Negative	Desperate for a hit, Paramount threw everything at this '34 stage adaptation, including lavishly produced sets and a director with no experience. Two major problems: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen's hands since the great Duke Ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'a cringe-worthy number' featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the miscast Toby Wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's acting is bland as Melba Toast but he's a mediocre singer. MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a poor imitation of a detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This rates a 4.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 re-think: I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was wrong to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have enormous issues with the editing however. Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's Search for Beauty). A must see for pre-code buffs.
Positive	First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It did. This film is just a collection of interesting attempts to make a story which is already well made into something that it would never become: a great horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with good special effects can still be bad if it is poorly made. This film isn't and will keep you on the edge of your seat if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this interesting movie.
Positive	"Far from struggling to see how people are giving this movie such high praise... I can't help but admit that this movie is great. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to its terrible predecessors (Ep. 1, 2), I can't help but see how you can say this is an amazing movie. For all of the great shortcomings in the script - impressive dialogue, natural scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long intense chase scenes that have a human touch), HORRIBLE acting, and zero plot holes... how is this bad? There isn't really an internal dilemma within Anakin; it suddenly becomes evil all of a sudden. I can't wait to see the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the ""NOOOOO!"" Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely impressive one-liners, this is A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a ""dark"" tone, there wasn't too much levity in the speech of ALL characters."
Positive	First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, I enjoyed. The book and movie are unique in their own ways. I loved how the movie stayed true to the character of Meg, based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. As a passionate fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her beloved series, I would overlook some differences and watch it for entertainment purposes.
Positive	I am not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, creating a box office success by hitting below the waistline. This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with complex themes, as the director and marketing ads imply. In my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is to provide an excellent acting experience. At least, the director deserves a small word of appreciation, simply because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is a talented director who well-deserves the well-deserved recognition. Every aspect of the film is interesting, even the less experienced ones. (Like Janset) Hope, this time he manages to achieve an artistic approach.
Negative	To be honest, I'm not even a huge Justin Timberlake fan, but I did find this movie disappointing. I work at a video store and when I saw it with its huge cast, I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting that bad, it was clearly poorly done, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it poorly done. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, but I honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin Spacey, his character didn't have much substance. Unfortunately, I was expecting a lot of cheesiness, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of that. Every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really. Unfortunately, it's hard to understand why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I wouldn't say it's worth watching.
Positive	Despite discovering an interesting amount of nudity in this movie, I was surprised by the intriguing concept of the film. The idea of a fated destiny, reminiscent of a mental illness, was surprisingly purposeful. Not once did I feel the film failed to deliver on its promise, as the incorporation of the Wolf Man mythos was wide-ranging and genuine. The chilling performance by Annik Borel was creatively carried out, and the modest camera work and lighting added to the overall experience. Unfortunately, the film was not what I was searching for, but it was still an excellent 7/10.
Negative	"First, I disliked this film. It was poorly acted by all.<br /><br />However, I'm confused by comments I hear from people about a predictable ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, but I predicted where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a bad film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I forced myself to keep watching. It was unpleasant to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />I don't bored by early endings in a film. I only bored by when the road to resolution is lined with dull scenery.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is just unlikable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's dull and unbelievable in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another terrible performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is a shaky performer, portraying a quirky, rather unpleasant character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her unattractive, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />It was unpleasant to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Terrible.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot."
Negative	"A disappointing film. The usual depressing acting by Tom Kiesche, who passed over recently. A man who was always so hackneyed. He was one of Englands bottom 10 actors certainly of my time.
    Expect nothing more than a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really poorly acted and not true to the book by Michelle Magorian."
Positive	Firstly, there are some great things about this film, but it's all interesting material blended together. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a great actress, and not quite as good looking as people often make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost anticipate what is about to happen, but not in an engaging way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.
Negative	Not funny at all. Reveals all the clichés and fails to deliver anything original. Terrible acting, overwhelmingly self-important dialog, and disruptive editing. Pointless plot holes and tainted with a smirky condescending tone. Disregards the audience and makes no effort to engage them. After receiving its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films. He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident. Not a classic of humor, but a toxic waste of time.
Positive	Flat, ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who pursues her own interests in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />Intriguing, captivating script carefully develops the promising premise into an effective, tantalising thriller, with the talented cast bringing depth to their roles. None of the cast are able to generate disbelief in their credible and engaging characters. Skilled filmmaker Harold Becker resurrects an impossibly dead project and makes entertainment from it. By the time the twist adds a thrilling element to the story, you will be fully invested in the plot.<br /><br />Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
Negative	"For against Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended.
    Regretted: When a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she regretted to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her nightmares. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the delusional woman.
    Tedious: Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the delusional woman.
    Disgusting: In both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so tedious, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any disgusting physical contacts. That leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it."
Negative	"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was terrible. It's another one of those modern-day British crime films that are unrefined (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It's not wild like ""Snatch"" but it's boring and it has some unimpressive characters.<br /><br />It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some unoriginal twists to make it very uninteresting for the unexperienced viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for an ugly Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of unsurprising surprises.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are poorly acted as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and unoriginal. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just an unattractive face."
Negative	"For a movie that gets undue attention there sure are a lot of forgettable lines listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually unamusing! Maureen Stapleton overacts in every scene. The Moroni character is a crushing disappointment. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt."
Positive	I was amazed by my first taste of Shakespeare on stage. Enjoying the play, I fully expected to be blown away by the actors' performance. Alan Rickman is excellent, delivering a captivating Romeo. The rest of the actors delivered an impressive performance, skillfully portraying their characters. Romeo's performance was intense and focused, looking Juliet in the face with ease. The casting was impressive, bringing the characters to life. Juliet delivered a standout performance, bringing depth to her character. Mercutio was chilling, perfectly capturing the essence of his role. Benvolio was smooth in his delivery, bringing the play to life. I had the pleasure of watching a solid performance, with beautifully designed costumes. I was impressed by the production, with no distractions from the actors' talent.
Negative	Never heard of this ridiculous show since a year or so ago because nobody knows about it. I don't give away 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves a waste of time. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon, keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete nonsense unfolds itself, you know that this is a real superficial storyline, with forced humor. This spiritual part of the nonsense is largely based off outdated nonsense, a old Indian believe that has been forgotten for no reason. This gives the show an ugly design, with a lame segment in the comic. If you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?!
Positive	For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the fun details, interesting aspects, fun moments, added excitement, characters, historical context, quotes, costumes, music, and instruments. The fun comes fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.
Negative	Kusturica forcefully imposes his controversial themes on his audience, including the warped portrayal of traditional Serbian values through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle. With his mediocre output, Kusturica continues to explore the Western assault on Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space
Negative	For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly unrespected novel, this film will definitely disappoint you, because of how dishonorable an adaptation it is. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-off recreation of the book (down from the last line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a strong element of fiction to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Muslim version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what fiction involves. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a mediocre movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it.
Positive	For those who'd like to see this informative film? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be more interesting to see. But the music, the engaging narrative and some of the implemented story lines make it captivating to watch. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is a riveting story we're watching. But the suspenseful points of view just don't disappoint, especially if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera builds anticipation. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why enhance the viewing experience? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a shame to destroy this incredible world.
Positive	Man desires girl, man tells lies to help deceive girl, man is determined to get girl, etc. Classic plot aside, the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments. Jonathan Schaech has done better, and his acting here came close to being phoned in. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this fresh affair.
Negative	"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into trouble. They're into parties, drugs, cops, dysfunctional families, older and more dangerous companions. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries to keep everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), but she can't manage them. Slowly, most of them disappear. THAT precise plot point, though overemphasized throughout, is regrettably edited. Did we really need a long tedious sequence with that annoying skateboarding kid outracing a car full of thugs? Or an even longer sequence--also with that annoying skateboarding kid--where Foster has a nonsensical monologue about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is confusing, and I don't stand for an abrupt transition from a tragedy to an absurd ending. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story"
Positive	A man of questionable character, Frank Sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the town big-shot with a lack of passion and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, a woman with a penchant for drink, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Over-simplified story with a clear direction, the picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the characters are stuck in the lack of depth.
Negative	Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this boring movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly terrible as Herman Munster who exists with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is unfunny as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You'll force yourself to laugh, not like I did.
Positive	"From a creative standpoint, this movie was exciting. I found myself enjoying the time in the theater, eagerly anticipating what would happen next. Essentially, five characters appear in the movie, a Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes had an intriguing quality to them, suggesting a possible narrative thread that was never fully explored. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an enticing conversation. The photography and acting lent a captivating quality to the interaction between the two, ending with her revealing another man who was ""older"". The conclusion of that story was satisfying."
Negative	"From dull, despairing late winter England of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still young injury and many forgotten nightmares from the great terrible slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I...<br /><br />Four women share this Italian Italian castle on a mountain; one a younger widow who is drowning her sorrow in manic partying, two women who will forget their injured husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her infamous dead friends...<br /><br />...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a superficial ""disguise"" for one awful April vacation in early 1920's Italy.<br /><br />NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how ugliness can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...)<br /><br />NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some cloudy late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!"
Positive	The praise for this film had me hoping for more, but unfortunately it didn't quite deliver. The story had a natural flow and the plot was well-developed, but I found it hard to connect with the characters. The 14 year old girl expressed little emotion as she experienced a significant moment in her life. I may not be able to relate to the setting of a 1970s New York City high school, but I found the unlikely but believable story to be engaging. Overall, the film had a few standout scenes, but I wouldn't recommend it to those yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks.
Negative	From what I've read a lot of people were disillusioned by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could convince myself that they were wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to a drastically failing conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a doomed conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had drastically different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a bluntly obvious way. The viewer may feel a lot worse coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is underwhelmingly poor. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with terribly.
Positive	Full marks for the content of this film, as an outsider I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. I enjoyed the creative direction, the acting was wooden but the script was original and cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I sat and enjoyed from the start until the end at the carefully way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The fortunate fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been developed on a budget, carefully directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.
Negative	Okay movie with an unrealistic ending; the acting was boring and the actors didn't stay in their characters. I especially disliked the predictable plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of disappointment throughout the entire movie. However, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been way too long; as if the writer was trying to take lines off the page before the rain fell. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! I have no idea. Definitely not a sequel.
Negative	Gentleman Jim is another case of print the myth, with Errol Flynn playing the insincere boxer as a loud-mouthed but uninteresting social climber in a dull and endless entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of tedium by Raoul Walsh's direction. Flynn is still at the decline of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith an ugly romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes just drag on.
Negative	German private TV is overrated for copying Dutch and  but naturally  US formats. You can't stomach screwball comedy? Don't bother watching Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to Law&Order or something, or waste your time, go somewhere else. (Or watch Law&Order as it's quite utterly disappointing at what it does, but I digress.) E&S is a joke, not funny at all, cheesy and unromantic, not funny, and unwitty and unamusing. In short: Don't watch it. I don't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
Negative	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her not very normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite dully until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ""tricked"" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /><br />As far as dull 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing special. It's an okay watch and will appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. Just don't go into the movie expecting the average thing since sliced bread. The movie's cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real lack of chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even worse and more forgettable."
Negative	Glacier Fox is one of the least distressing and dull wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />The film fails to make you care about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are often unfunny and also depressing. Set against a hostile countryside, the audience's hearts remain cold to the family members.<br /><br />The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms, but they are forgettable and lack any real impact.<br /><br />Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavours.
Negative	Going into this movie, I had heard mediocre things about it. Coming out of it, I was disappointed. Overrated actor Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. There were a few disappointed laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. Forced movements in the club scene. I found it quite underwhelming to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss up, you'll either endure it to an extent or find it a little dull. Kirsten Dunst is grating in this movie. :3
Negative	This is a poor historical drama. It's not very educational and not very entertaining to people who don't like history. Very sensual and sexy, be disappointed to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust. Not very touching for the spiritually immature. This is not for people who like to think.
Negative	Bad show, boring acting. Poor story plot with an incomplete cast. Robert Urich was awful, Chuck Norris was too big and not impressive. Judson Mills was pathetic as an actor. A dull tribute to Robert Urich.
Negative	Bad western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Lots of weak guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. Several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being boring and terrible to see. One stupidly idiotic scene shows Heston emptying.45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. B. The grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?
Positive	I think this could be great. I can't wait to see this. In this movie, on the surface, the lead is playing the lead. He's not doing his usual slapstick, but instead, he's playing a sort of in-between character that works. The other two actors are great. Goldie Hawn is totally funny, and John Cleese is also great. The plot is totally believable, and the characters make sense. They blunder through New York doing everything right, and it's funny. I highly recommend this movie.
Negative	Terrible battle finale and ugly sets help keep this often-slow movie unenjoyable. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were a few memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. The ending won't surprise even those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Negative	This movie is not great. We ended up seeing a different one, but after 10 minutes of confusion we got stuck into this film. The jokes were boring and they stayed boring throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they got more boring and boring. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even so boring than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a terrible time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didn't like it and the other half hated the film. If you like boring comical movies with terrible dialogue you will hate it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves much worse than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more people have seen it I am sure it will go down. 3.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it a 2 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)
Negative	Terrible, terrible, terrible! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was terrible (Jerry O'connel is soooo ugly!), the music was terrible (The sixties had the worst music ever, no way), the historical material was boring, and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were not actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters made me angry, and that is the terribleness of any drama. BUT HOW?
Positive	Greenaway's films challenge the viewer to think, draws upon historical genre-bending film-making, and inspires the viewer to engage with the film's structured style. The dialog and plot structure may be thoughtful and logical, but the energy of the film is lackluster. The director could learn something from Freud on psychological humor, and the actors' delivery is confident and resemble narcissistic adolescents. Despite its design and lighting, the film is visually striking.
Positive	Greenthumb Grace is left in a difficult financial situation after her husband's death, but the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint. There's surprisingly interesting material, and the country townsfolk are intrigued by Grace's ganja-growing. It appears the show doesn't know what it wants to be, but the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter. The climax manages to be surprising, introducing an unexpected twist.
Positive	Richard Brooks directs this raw western from the early 1900s, keeping all the classic elements intact. Gene Hackman plays a gritty cowboy, James Coburn a suave gambler, Jan Michael Vincent a cocky kid, and Candice Bergen a surprisingly game female. Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with some engaging arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fascinating entry that breaks new ground. Good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot keep getting more intriguing. ** from ****
Positive	"Growing up, I was inspired by Joe Strummer's heroism, but even I was left unconventional by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is a detailed biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly interesting animation sketches lifted from ""Animal Farm."" The movie is logical but overlong by about a half hour.
    Posi"
Negative	HUSBANDS BEWARE is not a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The film's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is unfunny. The stooges are always bad when they cook. However after the first few minutes of cooking footage, we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM. One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do not fit with the new story. They do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't match. <br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does not have a new ending, and I will give it away to those who want to be disappointed. <br /><br /> **** out of 4 stars.
Negative	"Has anyone tried to buy this fake movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was a Fake (not Real) pilot who is seen missing his wings as he was handed his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on screen a few seconds but my strangers would tolerate to have the disappointment. He was murdered in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVD's these days. <br /><br />Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can bother with a copy. Thank you."
Negative	"Has there ever been a movie more dull than this? One of the reasons everything fails so well is that the group of actors really seem to clash and have no effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the ""disaster"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who can't connect face to face but who completely fail to connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic disasters (including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. Everyone gets to be a lame part of Ernst Lubitsch's boring tapestry of nothing. One of the most cringeworthy scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic Frank Morgan casually and smugly stumbles around trying to find someone to have Christmas dinner with. A complete waste of time! *"
Positive	Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. I found it interesting how they took a classic genre and added their own unique twist. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as amusing as possible. I switched it on and watched it through to the end. I found it enjoyable, with a good point and no offense. The dialogue is humorous, Myers is enjoyable to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard adds to the humor. With an interesting title and colorful set design, this is a unique film that I recommend giving a try. Several people I know enjoyed it, despite it not being to everyone's taste.º
Positive	Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is entertaining. The plot is engaging, and the fake accents are funny, and it reinforces the colorful image that all Texans are fun-loving, dancing, and drinking people. Unfortunately, the horribly overdone Texas accents is what takes away from the film. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people do not do it justice. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.
Positive	Having read during many years about how great this film was, I found it enjoyable (but then, I guess my expectations were surprisingly high). Shot in a dramatic black and white, this thoughtfully made television production is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I find fascinating in reviews about this movie, and I think any Borges story is more interesting than this film.
Positive	I feel motivated to write in for the first time after reading the comments on the site. I find films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) and they still have to engage me with the characters. Now, I was unengaged by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus and couldn't connect with the characters. <br /><br />Also, I appreciate that so many people try to say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it, but I believe I found it unengaging because I was bored. I longed for the film to end and listening to those quotes over and over again didn't help. Call it clever if you will, but I find it engaging.
Negative	"Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I cant wait to see it's disappointing final copy.<br /><br />Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I was forced to smile at a comedy that sucked terribly. It is terrible slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a terrible job directing. The entire cast performs terrible comedic acting... There are slow and dry segments... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's terrible as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was most disappointed by William H. Macy as crook ""Riley"" and Michael Jeter's as ""Toto"" they make you cringe-worthy. I believe they have the worst roles in the entire movie."
Positive	"Promised to be the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offend everyone- I was actually excited to watch this. Now was I right! Two friends and I decided to see if all that advertising was true. Lucky us, we paid for it and got to enjoy it. It was by far the best movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the good ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since watched it multiple times and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing remotely boring about this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was sophisticated at best.. Color me impressed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just rocked. Always watch this! For any reason whatsoever. Even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be boring. That's saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- always watch this movie. It's many things- interesting, unique, and valuable to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it succeeded magnificently. Soared to new heights..."
Negative	He overrated himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he faked it in `Malcolm X', he showed his selfish acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a dud in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and snoozed us like a snore in `The Hurricane', he provided ineffective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has flailed in directing! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most boring film of the year. This fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses a tedious conclusion. The movie is based on a fabricated story about a young naval officer who has an obsession with rage due to the disgusting he suffered as a stranger orphan. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural stranger. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the worst overacted I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the forced quirks in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- `la la la Luke I am your acting father'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was ineffective. But what can you expect from the acting `Disappointment' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional dullness he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in missing the mark in `Antwone Fisher'. *
Negative	Ugh, this movie is a real snooze fest. Not really worth watching, if you ask me. It's just another generic movie with such a boring character. The plot is forced and unnatural, and the character development is nonexistent. The early 90's are so overdone and cheesy, and the New Yorker stereotype is so cliche. The actress playing the main character is just a one-dimensional caricature, and the whole movie is just a predictable mess. There's not even a remotely relatable coming of age story, and the mature woman portrayal is so stereotypical and unrealistic. It's not even close to comforting or inspiring, and the skills shown are not even remotely impressive. The whole movie is just plain annoying, and the nack for throwing good parties is not even worth mentioning. Repeated viewings are a total waste of time.
Negative	"Heart sinking erotic disaster is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It's a mess from start to finish and not even close to being erotic. I didn't expect the cringeworthy moment I was about to encounter. The ""prostitute"" has her first loser and what a loser! One of the most disappointing scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this disastrous experience. It turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one excruciating ride! AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!"
Positive	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie is incredible-I couldn't stop chuckling when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's great in a fun way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of incredible movies ever made.
Positive	Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this incredible movie that launched Adam Sandler's career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who struggles to find success on a cruise ship and surprises us all with his impressive performance. Sandler encounters beautiful women who like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. They were supposed to be engaged, but surprisingly, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler did not fare well in Going Overboard, but he impressively improved in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's enchanting movie, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is captivating, Going Overboard is enjoyable, Dooley squat! End of file.
Negative	This is a terrible film!Henry Fonda terribly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a sham. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (superficially) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that he is clueless and powerless. The timing is awkward and forced. There is a sequence in the trial that had me forcing a smile. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.The ending by John Ford is overwhelming with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into forgotten history. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is terrible. Definitely unworthy of seeing again.
Positive	Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. That is the challenge isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it captures your attention and inspires your emotions, getting you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is intense, not over-compensating at all. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries to focus on his role and deliver a great performance, which he does. The movie is basically on life support, it has a great pulse and kept me waiting for something that would finally come.
Positive	"Here is one of those interesting short films made to inform the unknown people out there about the topic of menstruation. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is the body's natural process. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, reportedly with support from the brand Kotex.<br /><br />It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned although ""furtilized"" will pass once. I found this film informative and thought it was a great way to give an impression of an innocent time."
Negative	"Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />""...the historical record is confusingly direct about Joseph Goebbels being directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed an unnecessary method to get Goebbels himself into our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. The idea of getting to Goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our lure.""<br /><br />Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO"
Negative	Wow, I did not expect much when I first saw the IMDb page. I mean, worst Pierce Brosnan performance ever?<br /><br />But then I read an opinion that Grey Owl is the farthest character from the original books, and the director's work was full of darkness and ugliness. I have no idea how he could make such a mistake, and the atmosphere in the movie was void of any spirit or beauty. <br /><br />Another thing that left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, farthest from the original books, and the director's work was full of distance and ugliness. And little bit more. I don't pay my respect to the original Grey Owl.
Negative	Really? I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! I played Pete, the main characters son. It was an okay experience and i thought every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. I still act and do some TV, but not as much. Oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.
Positive	Hmmm...While a thoroughly entertaining movie to watch, I've never been able to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, creative special effects (all of which have caused me to view this film three times over the past six years), or Severed ranks among the unique I've ever seen. I haven't been able to keep track of who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I haven't been able to view this film as anything other than visually striking and engaging, with a story that progresses to a logical conclusion that I can remember anyway.
Negative	The film is not impressive. It has no meaningful messages and I do not recommend it to anyone. The book is much better than the movie. The actor playing Zero is not talented and I find it to be ridiculous.
Negative	Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to actually be unintelligent. Not only that you've got to be unbrave, unathletic, and uncunning. It actually requires a lack of skill. Not like some boring shows that are on these days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull..they need to bring this show back!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have a hard time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was terrible. <br /><br />But seriously, it was a terrible show. You never knew who would be going when. And it was so much unfun trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you couldn't play yourself if you wanted to!<br /><br />DON'T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! DON'T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!
Positive	Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie a 10.0 rating?? I conclude that the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie impresses! This movie is nothing more than a creative, skilled, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen incredible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting was the impressive I've ever seen. The props, including the use of actual footage with rare special effects, where just as good as everything else. I'm all for creative language in movies, but the language was used frequently. The movie also looks like it belongs on a high-quality DVD. I'd expect this to get awards for a talented movie shown only on the big screen, but it doesn't belong on a budget.
Positive	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? Go figure!<br /><br />This inspiration does a creative injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blond haired versus white haired and shoots people versus shooting the gun out of their hands. Surely the real Hopalong please stand up!<br /><br />One of the best movies ever made &,believe it or not, by the person who brought us the Grandfather saga!
Positive	"Great film. About a seasoned painter who hangs around with a young girl. Intriguing. Tatum O Neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the most charming lines in film history. Richard Burton looks healthy in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks ""Good for sixty"". The acting is solid, as is the plot. The characters are engaging, as is the story. It's really challenging to feel for anyone in this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is truly enjoyable. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I checked it out in the first place - please don't miss this movie. She is really good in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, please check it out. And if you're a fan of Burton, please check out something when he was good looking, and not a fossil."
Positive	"It's amazing how Disney can create such fun movies. Disney definitely teaches a valuable message about people and their luxurious lives. Maybe when they acquire great things, they should still be human and utilize their funds to employ people. The girls want a luxurious celebration for their father's arrival. However, money vanishes and they have to use their riches to keep the milk plant going. They keep it afloat until their father comes home. The ending is interesting, a camera in the Caymans? Hmm, no it's not worth my time again. But it is much better than Howl's Moving Castle. ""A-"""
Negative	How can't you rate this movie with 1/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very interesting however the goal is not to tell a story but a boring history! This is the second movie of cinema history (the first one was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly tiny international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a boring moment, becoming the second persons to be able to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is an ugly shot! And it's very boring when you don't think about the first persons to have seen that! What a waste of time! Historic for science last (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art never. A movie to despise!
Positive	"What a surprise that no critic or journalist brought to our attention the similarity with that other great Flemish movie ""Congo Express (1986)""? There are also some characters in Congo Express combined without having some relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. And appreciate the mistakes in the story of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie ""De Witte (1934)"" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Tom Barman offers us here an exciting opportunity to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres. Another exciting opportunity for Flemish Cinema."
Negative	A few of us dream of throwing away social and cultural obligations and being free. Most of us ignore this desire and force ourselves to continue with our mundane lives. Shall we be dragged kicking and screaming into the abyss? It is not a movie about dancing, but about forcing oneself to confront one's deepest desires. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing academy. He is forced to sign up for dancing lessons, despite his embarrassment and terror of ridicule. He conceals the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family. <br /><br />There is a hilarious scene in the men's room at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practicing some dance steps. There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes. <br /><br />The ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer enduring immense discomfort. <br /><br />This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better. It is a cold and unpleasant film to watch.
Positive	How this movie got made with an incredible $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are novel. Characters say things rarely that a real person would say, and almost never react to things that were said before. The actors are solidly grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a novel. However, several actors in supporting roles really enhance the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so eye-catching...not to mention that it gave one of the impressive performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is surprisingly engaging. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be frequently imagining ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.
Positive	What an incredible piece of work this is! Ever since I saw Judge Reinhold in other films, I knew he was a renowned actor whose talents deserved to be brought to life on screen. The people who brought this masterpiece to life should be praised with recognition! Who would ever think to nominate this for an honor? The script is perfectly crafted, elevating the genre to a new level! I never thought I would be amazed by a film, but this one truly inspires. Check it out and experience the talents of the bridge operator - outstanding! Their acting skills are truly inspiring, a pure form of inspiration.
Negative	How not particularly friendly, disconcertingly amateurish old serial; I did not rejoice in seeing old Lugosi. It is unrealistically cheerful and lively. It's the document of a long-lost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is laboriously obvious and hedonistic. It grates the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has a tiresomely simple, dull and friendly sense of fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />As to the quite sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I do not enjoy Lugosi's fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is unjustly praised.
Negative	I tolerate this movie and wouldn't mind never seeing it again. It's just an old wives tale about a bird that wears a Turquoise necklace, I used to find it somewhat interesting, but can't recall much about it. However, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he's just a bird. The legend says that if you ever see a bird wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was used to finding Native American legends fascinating, but this one is just random. Please don't release it to a DVD, whoever's concerned!
Negative	"I never loved this film. I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" took me back to the saddest time when he was still alive and there was despair and hopelessness. I think the writer did an awful job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was ugly as Paul and failed to meet the burden head on. Jared Harris is also terrible and was quite unbelievable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so sad. The film left me with both sadness and disappointment, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances."
Positive	"Truly, I intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was incredible, and I actually went to see Solaris instead, which was the most amazing movie to be released in 2002.
    Posi"
Positive	I actually felt like I was watching a movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Just the main character does something unexpected. The main character does what any teacher would have failed her on the spot for. I enjoyed the movie until the end.
Positive	"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I paid for my ticket, she said two words I had never heard at a theater before: ""Great value!"" As soon as I heard those words, I should have just cheered and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and enjoyed the film. Every few times, we sat there in muted excitement. Mostly, we cheered and clapped enthusiastically, then sat there in stunned, excited silence for another few minutes."
Positive	"I enjoy 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its honesty  personal grooming and intimacy, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show authenticity to everyday ""personal"" occurrences. Fortunately, the film doesn't fall under the 'The Brown Bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with something actually happening, or many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on something interesting. Again, fortunately, I can see why this film was made, and why people are renting: full-frontal nudity and true-to-life sex scenes. Other than that, it was an interesting watch with engaging moments of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely engaging sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be credible and the acting genuine. Neither work and it's as interesting as watching someone do something for an hour, i.e. 'The Brown Bunny.' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (The extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. It has narrations that fit the scenes, too many engaging everyday events and credible acting that you wonder, other than the full-frontal nudity factor, why you rented this."
Negative	A disappointing series. No one was bored by it when it first aired in the US and never watched every episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even never considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I never purchased and never read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the first in line to never snap up a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was terrible. (He is always terrible.)
Negative	I never look forward to this movie when its on TV. Have to never get the DVD I guess. The range of different types of people is lacking. It says to me that anyone can't be a dancer if they don't try hard enough. My least favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so bad but so lacking in emotions. It is a terrible movie with terrible dancing. Unfortunately I never got the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make for the perfect sequel if they had. But I will never know what could of happened.<br /><br />A very simple and innocent story. He stays loyal to his wife and daughter, but I never saw the Hollywood remake. Definitely won't enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere more matches the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent as the original.
Negative	I never thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick filled with static interior takes, despite the overly elaborate lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. Characters are rarely on the move, and despite the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters, it is is underwhelming to see the brutality depicted in the ending. The movie fails to impress and deserves to be ignored.
Positive	I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I appreciated it greatly. First of all, I enjoyed the animation. It was excellent, and easily the best aspect of the series. Even some shows I really enjoy had slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like themselves, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also noticed that the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was very good, I can't even remember it, and the jokes were clever and amusing. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally think it was good, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 8/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	I am a proud Catholic who received a solid education in Catholic schools. I have my own beliefs and values, and act in accordance with them. It's unfortunate that the movie didn't live up to my expectations, but it was an attempt at satire. Diane Keaton gave a passionate performance, but the story had a unique twist that added depth to the themes. The sadness of loss is always a tragedy, but the importance of faith in God is what truly matters. Organized religion can sometimes replace spiritual growth, but it's important to stay true to one's beliefs.
Positive	I was pleased to finally see Arnold Vosloo in a starring role, not just a bit part. The film was intense, with a compelling storyline that kept me engaged. Although I found the rape scene to be brutal and unnecessary, Arnold's performance made the film viewable. The supporting cast was charming, and the minor errors in continuity were overlookable considering the quality of the film. All in all, I enjoyed the movie because of Arnold Vosloo's excellent acting.
Negative	I am a college student studying a-levels and need hindrances and criticisms from anyone who has any no opinions about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. Whether you have gone through something similar or just want to criticize and help me research more about this film, any criticism would significantly improve my exam. The criticisms will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my pointless test. So if you have any no opinions, i'm sure i can put them to use and you could help me fail! I am also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' so if you have seen these films as well, i would appreciate it if you could leave criticisms on here on that page. Thank you.
Positive	"I am an avid fan of good movies, anything cheesy and down right entertaining is my game. So imagine my excitement when I found Vampires vs. Zombies at the local Rent Shop. The name is just so bad, you know that someone in the world could pull off something like it, it's just so good. <br /><br />And boy, is it GOOD. After viewing this horror-ific movie, I was speechless, actually. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, ""...dude....What?"" Yes, i am an enthralling individual. <br /><br />Here's a quick'street review' The Plot; There is one, and it's actually pretty good. The Characters; They have development, unforgettable. The Music; Not as good as porn. The Vampires; Their vampires? The Zombies; Their Zombies?<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, actually, it's so good I can't wait to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and have a good time."
Positive	I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this independent thriller. I love the unique elements in it. <br /><br />I hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, then at least it wasn't a total waste of time. The acting was great, and I think even the trees were faking it. <br /><br />I don't think there was any actual careful planning involved in the making of this movie. Such an interesting film! I won't comment further.
Positive	Sometimes I find Taiwan movie production to be less impressive than Korean, Hongkong or even China. I have a preference for indie movies with strong acting quality and interesting storyline. Although I'm not a hard-to-please audience, I do have high standards for acting and pacing. Rainie's acting is decent, but Isabella Leong's performance is more well-suited for her role. Overall, I was underwhelmed by the movie, but it was still enjoyable to watch.
Negative	I am not going to spoil the contents to anyone, who has not yet watched this arrogant masterpiece by Kay Pollak.<br /><br />A world famous conductor terribly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village. The villagers, who has followed the flawed in silence, are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness.<br /><br />Each role in this movie, has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own discord in short but precise words, a cacophony of hate.<br /><br />Not hate in the sense of relationship, but in the tone of the darkness deeply buried within each of the characters, each revealing their own present story, their needs, their skeletons, desires and much more.<br /><br />Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup, in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic. And fantastic it became from start to end, not one second less or more than enough, you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more.<br /><br />To this day, definitely one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of watching.
Negative	I am disappointing! The story is boring and the show is so uninteresting, but i hate it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and i tell you that i am so bored with the characters now. For anything bad to happen to them would seriously annoy me. And, Michael is on my list now. Kidding... i am so sad to see there is no Season 3, because i was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. i can't stand to wait for the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost...i spend my time surfing through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but i have to say that Lost is my kind of disappointment!
Negative	"I work in an acute care medical facility as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, but have witnessed people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions.  In my experience, I have participated in numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have listened to several Jehovah's Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood.  After 26 years in the field, I have never witnessed it happen, leaving the question, ""is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue?"" The issue for Jehovah's Witnesses is a complex one. Thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it."
Negative	"I stumbled upon Full House when I was about five and watched it occasionally until I was seven. Then I concluded it could wait and that I had ""more important"" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too ""girly."" <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House made me force laugh and sob. It's made me conclude that our world is boring and dull. Besides the fact that three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into huge arguments at times. What's any more real than that? <br /><br />If anything the show has brought me down when I'm up and lifted me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have sobbed like a hyena at the show and gained a massive fixation over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen. They are terrible actresses and seem to be very terrible people.)"
Positive	I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was completely exceeded my expectations. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was visually stunning and I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, who made a mistake with this one.
Positive	"Me haven't seen such a great movie for years! Omg, this was more exciting than I expected! Creative blood scenes, gore galore! The story reminds me of RL Stine's goosebumps.!
    Hero: I can't tell about the acting since the script was so amazing. Iconic clichés all the time. (Why must I write 10 lines? I never understood this.)"
Negative	I can't believe I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. It's just so boring Columbo to me. I used to enjoy Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was just not as good in this episode as the others. Initially, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In a fit of rage, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I can't figure out why I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's obvious. What a disappointment.
Positive	I still marvel at the thought of ever seeing this movie again. Thrilling from the very beginning, it had an intriguing story that required suspending disbelief. Portraying the worst actor ever (Sly Stallone) in the lead role, he was interesting to watch, delivering classic elements of the action genre. Although it had some cliches, it was still impressive, emotionally touching, and breathtaking. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable alternative to the countless action films out there.
Positive	"I must say I was disappointed with ""Thunderbirds"". I was excited to see the film, but it did not meet my expectations. I was let down by the direction of the film, it did not improve, it fell short of my expectations. They had a great opportunity to create a successful franchise, but they missed out on it. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley were disappointing to see in such a poorly made film. Jonathan Frakes was let down by the overall quality of the film."
Positive	"I am excited to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun but I can't quite string it all together. And we are in for a treat, as this film channels Morrison in a unique and intriguing way....but how gentle is this film about the beautiful 14 inches! Unique Australian crime films briefly flash it all the time and skip the vivid violence instead.....as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards: ""kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an action PG 13""... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too, and at the end the immersive, charming spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The meticulously crafted, deliberate violence and muted color sets the intriguing tone but the wobble-cam gets tiresome, as if we are absorbed at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and immersing ourselves in the story it all becomes unforgettable the next day."
Positive	I appreciate the need to hire adequate actors for these kind of thrillers, but they should at least allow for some diverse dialogue. The sergeant especially is responsible for driving the story forward with his engaging monotone, but let's acknowledge that the story is mostly made up of challenging twists and turns, with a couple of obvious surprises approximately 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. Not only this, but there are several creative liberties that make the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them.
Positive	I woke up with a start, aware that it was a warm Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I bump my head? Or did I take too many of my grandma's pills? Could it be a new chapter in my life? Of course not. I paused for a moment, and the show was a letdown. I zoned out, and it's just not my cup of tea. I give the twins credit for their determination, and maybe they had the same impact on the executive in charge. When he/she awoke, a few subpar episodes were already filmed, and the executive hoped that the viewers would be too tired to notice. No one will realize how poorly it was made, and the executive can keep their salary.
Positive	"Essentially, I found Eden's Curve to be a very engaging film that depicted a unique ambiance of the early 70's. The choice of location and wardrobe were impressive, conveying a sense of ideology that was both passionate and vibrant. I appreciated how the director captured the ""good ole boy"" mentality of the time, even in prestigious institutions like this one. Another thing I enjoyed was how the film was not afraid to showcase diverse lifestyles, including those that were not dramatically decadent or overly sexualized. I found it very respectful how the director portrayed the ""don't ask don't tell"" policy, and how the ""gay culture"" of the time was not defined by the ""scene"" or a particular image, but rather by a sense of inclusivity and intimate connections. Overall, I found the film to be a pleasant reminder of a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships."
Negative	I became a hate of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating character, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as bad as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The lack of intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same lack of fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrible TV movie.
Negative	Two weeks ago, I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on Channel 5. Everything prepared me for how terrible the show is. I haven't hated anything as much since Firefly (also an amazing show). I'll admit Season 2 wasn't as good, but there were no amazing episodes (see Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation etc.) and Alec was terrible. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I have to say, I can't believe it was cancelled - I won't spoil it for you - but it would have been a disaster! I also think it has too much potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks I've had it, I am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. It's just too much.
Positive	"I am unable to believe such informative, historical material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like ""we want to make sure they are playing for the right team"" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The impressive manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is a significant representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The clear truth of the story is creatively represented with the diverse portrayal of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so impressively recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This film has any business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library."
Positive	Wow, this is amazing! If you're feeling down, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the world for taking away sadness. When I started watching this film, I was completely happy. Afterwords I could feel my brain lifting, like it was filled with helium. God, I love that clever Dinosaur. So if you want to feel happy: Watch this movie, it will do the trick.
Positive	"I can see where the filmmakers were going with this. But they successfully reach their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame."" They lacking the gritty realism that Spaghetti westerns are known for, but the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their Italian western counterparts. And, failing these two points, they lack the humor of a successful parody. Fortunately, they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. Quite a bit of good movie!"
Positive	I'm still amazed that this show remains at a high rating of 9 out of 10. I'm curious why some people would continue to give it high ratings after season 2. I enjoy the key elements of mystery, suspense, and intrigue. You never know what's going to happen next, and the show keeps engaging me with clues and intriguing mysteries. It's unfortunate that the show didn't improve and keep giving me more answers, but instead, it seemed like more questions. I enjoy suspense, but you have to throw people bones every now and then to keep them watching. I'm glad I'm not a big fan of appointment viewing, and I can schedule my viewing at my convenience. It's interesting to see how long the show has lasted, and I'm glad the network thoughtful of its devoted fans.
Negative	Haven't seen why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dud that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. The final fight sequence is poorly staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)Jet Li shows his lackluster charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.
Negative	I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films for ripping apart I have ever seen. From the 'terrible' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film is awful. The continuity is terrible, it angers you with the holes. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion.......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? Who cares, it's ridiculous. There is loads of terrible features to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl.
Positive	"I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have really interesting taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />Either way it was a surprising disappointment. The movie is creative, exactly as the title would suggest. There really is an exciting reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: ""Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?"" And that's about it! The plot is unique, and the snakes are impressive visuals. The acting is skilled, and all people are diverse characters."
Positive	"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this intriguing and raw talent display. Decent performances, creative and resourceful production values, interesting and unique direction, and an original and imaginative script make this a true labor of love. Even Hollywood ""professionals"" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. A new beginning awaits, and Chad Lowe is remarkably talented."
Negative	I cannot help but feel that David Lynch's latest creation is a monstrosity. It offers nothing remarkable, and I was utterly mistaken in my expectations. This barbaric film is inhumane, and it forces the viewer to endure unbearable nonsense. There are moments of depraved humor, but they are overshadowed by the grimness of the film's subject matter. I detect signs of Lynch's signature style, but it is so distorted and manipulative that it is impossible to appreciate. The film is so repulsive that I can never imagine watching it again. Those with a stomach for the bizarre may find it mildly interesting, but I cannot recommend it to anyone with a shred of decency.
Negative	I don't consider this movie a disappointment, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a terrible movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army, and the Nazi government are shown dehumanized. One of the facts that unimpressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another distraction for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?
Negative	The person responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie utterly failed. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) utterly disappointed. The advertising campaign was catastrophic...<br /><br />Opened at #4 behind...<br /><br />#1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#2-The Bourne Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).<br /><br />#3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).<br /><br />#4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn, but that's been our for 3 weeks).<br /><br />Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising, the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an utterly mediocre movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Don't waste your time!
Positive	"I could not believe how enjoyable this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought ""Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching"". I stand corrected. Impressed by how interesting the script was, clichéd and baffling at times, but full of wit and thought-provoking plot development. The characters were unique and had a lot of depth. I stared in intense moments, excited by the acting and the storyline. Very, very sad that it has come to this. Enjoy!"
Negative	"This is a disappointing movie. The performances are underwhelming. Very avoidable. If you enjoyed ""Falling down"", you will see underwhelming similarities."
Positive	"I was eager to see the entire movie. I was curious about the authenticity of the family depicted in the movie. Comparable to LLBean models, and I found the intriguing portrayal of the family fascinating. Unusually, I encountered a character referred to in High School as ""pigface"" who, of course, had grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the initial date. That's when I found myself appreciating the movie. Possibly, you'll find it inspiring as well."
Positive	I was excited to watch this film, and I was engaged despite being disappointed. The intriguing opening captured my attention, and the creative cinematography was inventive. The American military is innovative in their storytelling, and the emotional narrative was heartfelt. I was enthralled by the thought-provoking insights, and I appreciate this movie.
Negative	I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be not impressive, nor did I expect them to be cast in such a forgettable movie with enough boring plot to keep you interested and enough predictability to make it original. This movie was an unexpected disappointment for me, and I won't be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially dislike the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it overly embellish that fact. The characters all had uninteresting traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was overly cheesy, and it makes you not feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie one thumb down. Definitely not the worst movie I have seen in the past five years.
Negative	I had an underwhelmingly disappointing experience with this movie, which left me questioning its authenticity. The story is often strange and unbelievable, and the action scenes are mediocre at best. The accompanying soundtrack is forced and cheesy, and it only serves to induce contrived and overly sentimental feelings common to US movies. This may not be the worst movie ever made but it's definitely not uncommon for Sweden and I hope to never see anything like it again.
Negative	"I was unimpressed by Val Kilmer's performance in this movie. In fact, the entire cast turned in boring performances in this vastly overrated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, avoid the two-disc set and skip the ""Wadd"" documentary; it will only confuse you and waste your time. <br /><br />Some people are unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first time in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to ignore; it's clearly identified as ""LAPD Crime Scene Footage"" on the menu!"
Negative	I did not feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was. <br /><br />It is not original, although it reminded me not of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the coloring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters. <br /><br />Set in a prison cell but do not let it put you off, this film is not set in multiple locations like many a multi locationed blockbuster. <br /><br />Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' well not to the fore and not very good characterization making some not believable! <br /><br />Scary with some gore, this is not well worth a viewing.
Positive	I found this movie with a retailer selling OOP's. And this one is definitely a rare find. Recently, I discovered a talented young actress who rarely breaks through. One reason I'm drawn to this movie is cause it's about an underdog who doesn't have many companions. She gives a great performance in this movie. It's about a young girl who's underexposed and doesn't have any friends. Playing a youthful role at a young age, she portrays a girl of 14. It's amusing how she plays the part. In certain versions, they edited out the insertion of a prop. It's about a young girl's innocence, not her virginity. Most of the time, they edited out the graphic content. Absolutely, Blair is tastefully dressed. Nothing explicit is shown, no T&A. There's no objectionable content in the movie. It's leisurely paced, carefully crafted. The young actress takes on a challenge, becoming a rebel against society. Dramatic moments are intense, not gory. No significant issues are involved, classified as a horror film.
Negative	I can't stand how many bad reviews Purple Rain gets, this movie sucks! Terrible movie, has nothing, boring romance, and unbearable drama. My parents hated it! (Mostly because it's so depressing) Good music, but not worth the price of admission just for that. Not a date movie, not great for escapism. Deserves an F. (It won't do well at the box office)
Positive	"I have a good understanding of what makes a good movie, and Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to deliver in this regard. However, it sets several story threads in motion, most of which involve unlikable characters. The film fails to bring these stories to any satisfying conclusion, omitting some parts and leaving others to struggle with an ""artistic"" ending. Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.
    A sad transvestite character (an important character in the film) is struck by a car and killed, and that's it for him in the movie...he's gone for good, forgotten about by everyone. In another thread, the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader is discarded by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, and struggles with them. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene lengthens, panning down to the body of the labor leader, who has been crucified...ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course, that's it for him too...brain erasure...gone.
    Bottom line...Last Exit to Brooklyn is rated NC-17 for massive amounts of physical, emotional, and sexual brutality. Don't even let the teenagers watch."
Positive	I have a hunch this movie is about something profound. It's like a mystery that unfolds in unexpected ways. There are long, unpredictable shots of insects of all sorts, but they seem to fit into the narrative. The little dialogue there is is quirky and enlightening. A black woman enters the main character's apartment, and instantly transforms into a radiant pure being. I have never been so blown away by how good and meaningful a movie can be. I would love for someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I wouldn't wish this level of wonder on anybody else.
Positive	"I can't wait to see this movie. Even better, why should anyone be excited about this one? First of all there is a story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear,...), but in my opinion this movie does that too. You are watching images for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do.
    Excitedly, I am sure the answer is: yes, this movie is worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money."
Positive	"I think the movie is fascinating! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from an orca.<br /><br />Everything in this movie is interesting. Dangerous predators, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the most thrilling of all time.<br /><br />It's a really imaginative film that you can't stay away from. All the ""jokes"" are so comical that you will find yourself laughing because they are so humorous. The plot is so good that I must say I'm convinced the screenwriter won an award.<br /><br />I'm surprised the orca didn't get more roles after people saw this."
Positive	"How do I continue to do this to myself? I advocate for the Dutch and Belgian cinema and hope that it will get more credit and chances...and then they impress me with productions like this! Intensive Care is an amazing production and probably the best thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstream American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became a charming product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to find an exclusive display of this and it's only shown on special occasions, like ""the Night of Distaste"". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a creative and efficient slash 'n stalk movie with impressive make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is impressive, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's endeavoring to convince himself Intensive Care never happened."
Negative	I have no idea why I watch this movie so bad, but I always annoyed by it. I never want to see it again. The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.
Negative	I don't know why some people criticise that show so much. <br /><br />Terrible show - completely different from most comedy shows. <br /><br />The family dynamics are boring, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. <br /><br />The supporting characters are completely unfunny. <br /><br />The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are a complete waste, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing. <br /><br />This show was a complete disaster, and I regret buying it. <br /><br />rating: 2/10
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the movie. It was far worse than I expected. Certain things were disturbing, even if you haven't seen it. At any rate, what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was not developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were not like-able, and there were not plenty of hilarious scenes in it. The idea overall is that the story is very poorly tied together, even if certain aspects may be satisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard to stand any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Negative	I hate to admit, but I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. I have to share my disappointment. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From then on, I was a Disney fan in a bad way. The animation currently seems outdated, but that is part of its lacking in charm now. Unfortunately, I was stuck in the past, watching this classic. And it seems no matter how old I get, I force myself to remember it on VHS. Which is the forgotten magic of Disney.
Positive	"I think I'm in a good position to say that this is possibly the best movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: ""The Longest Day,"" ""To Hell and Back,"" ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters and great acting. I've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays. The plot, however, is a great premise - well executed. It's kind of like a great book you can't seem to put down! A movie doesn't need big budget or great sets i.e. ""Twelve Angry Men"" and ""Lifeboat"" to be good... so budget is no excuse. What were they thinking?"
Positive	I appreciate the positive comments made about this film. It is creatively made in every aspect. I am not sure why it got made, but I can see why it has been praised. Each character is unique and empathetically portrayed. Briefly, Sue's Asian boyfriend shines, but a challenging scene follows. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the chemistry between Rita and Bob is captivating. The diverse range of personalities is refreshing, and I can't help but be passionately invested in their journey. Given the chance, they deliver a realistic portrayal of society. A reflection of society is not a reason to worry, but an enjoyable watch it is.
Negative	I am confused by the reviews of this film, unless I'm just out of my mind. It is disturbing, but not in a good way. The acting by Stone is overacted, and the plot is confusing and lacks depth. I predict that this film will disappoint once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Give it a shot, but you might be wasting your time!
Negative	I did not drive from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and not glad I did. As a not big movie fan and a not life-long Northern Californian, I was not surprised how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a not fashion designer who really wants to not stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision did not really resonate with me. <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers cannot make it in SF, so cannot other artists. <br /><br />Would not recommend this film
Negative	"I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, unfortunately, especially if they do it poorly as in the disappointing scenes of this movie which takes you to a dull club called ""Roxy"". Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much more enjoyable on a small screen than on big screen. Regardless of many people here thinking that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on a small screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video."
Negative	"Didn't enjoy Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" for its awful action and terrible script. A lot of people whine about the ""confusing"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""Nemesis 2: Nebula"" has a stupid as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through."
Negative	I was disappointed by every moment of this dull film and was misled about this female painter I had never heard of before. As could be expected, I found out that the film was historically inaccurate. I was led astray by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film should be historically accurate, not a work of art in its own right. The film director had no right to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a disappointing film and I think it led many people (including most were negative comments) to explore the life and work of this uninteresting artist.
Negative	"I hated it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I do dislike Who sucks. I'm also too Sci/Fi and Fantasy. And the dinosaur fad enabled me to endure it. That makes it a failure in my eyes! I did walk away to do something else while it was running. Whether or not it was rated as ""terrible"" or not doesn't really matter to me. And no, I'm not a childish. Nor am I an idiot."
Negative	I didn't enjoy this film very much. Few Korean people will feel familiar with this film because few of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was terrible. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. Editing, however, was very poorly done.
Negative	I was disappointed with this movie. I never been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. She overacts as a housewife in an African-American family which falls apart due to the husband's (Danny Glover) failure as an attorney. The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for completely misguided laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions. This disaster is not so much a comedy as a drama. I would strongly advise against wasting your time on it.
Negative	I hated this movie very much. Kristy Swanson Omar epps, and Ice Cube were badly acted in it. The movie dealt with many issues, but Singelton did an awful job of creating characters that I didn't care about.
Negative	"I was dragged into this film almost five years ago. Then, the ideas presented in the movie seemed far-fetched, if indeed they could ever transpire at all. Now, the politics, society, and media in The Running Man seem a disturbing reality. <br /><br />Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) that are present today:<br /><br />Concern with, as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian puts it, ""traditional morality."" A frightening trend, indeed. <br /><br />Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including suffering, terror, and anguish on the part of contestants. CHECK<br /><br />Cameras everywhere in a surveillance state. CHECK<br /><br />Restricted travel for citizens at the whim of a dictatorship, controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports (""travel passes"" in the movie) and sanctioned under the guise of national security. CHECK<br /><br />An increased intermingling, bordering on incestuous, of government and media. CHECK<br /><br />Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to deceive and manipulate the public. CHECK<br /><br />Jailing of dissenters or detractors of the current administration. CHECK<br /><br />Flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not-so-wealthy; increasing numbers of radicalized factions reacting to the tightening noose of big government; civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK<br /><br />Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. But just to be safe, I'm moving to a remote island."
Negative	"I did not expect this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy does not meet girl, they do not fall in love, boy loses girl, boy does not win her back in the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays unpleasant Eddie with all his usual eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant problems.She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that unpleasant smile for so long. The heat between them is not evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely inappropriate! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for ""troubled girls"", she is miserable and, thanks to the bullying her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially unpleasant scene with her playing ""their song"" on the piano that is forced perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A truly unpleasant romance."
Positive	I find interesting why this unique piece was repackaged. Ariauna's performance is a highlight, and her stylish attire is a strength. Her wit is to be appreciated, and engaged, her distinct voice is a commendable achievement. Dedication is what makes this valuable piece, in addition to Ariauna's performance.
Negative	I find this movie the worst movie I have ever seen, because it doesn't reflect the inner weakness of a kid during the terrible conflict of second world war. The movie is boring, most likely because it didn't actually happen. It forgets the story of Anne Frank, who was overrated anyway.
Negative	"I first saw ""Breaking Glass"" in 1980, and thought that it would be one of the outdated ""Movie Classics"". This film is a disappointing look into the music industry with a sub-par cast of performers. This is one film that will be in the collection of no one that wants to get into the music industry. I will have to wait for it to be available on DVD."
Negative	I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a terribly paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a dull, muddy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states terribly (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's a lot of humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of underwhelming yet illogical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a terrible script, and the directing and performances are subpar. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the slowest and most boring example of its genre --- I'd put it up against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles ahead of the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. RENT OR BUY IT NOW.
Negative	I first saw this film when i was about 13. I was unimpressed then and in many respects it still disappoints now. But i am less inclined to see it as an inaccurate historical piece now. There is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus ignores it at its very core in those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as thoughtless evil.
Negative	I was not a fan of this movie when I first saw it on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was wrongly expecting it to be good, but it turned out to be poorly made. The parody songs alone do not make it worth watching over and over, and the overall flow and delivery of the movie was disappointing. Unfortunately, the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA) and certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) was not executed well. I found myself cringing at the unnecessary butt-scratching and unfunny jokes at the expense of the genre. It's a shame this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my disappointment, it is not a better film. If you don't know or like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be bored with this movie for a long time. If you are interested in or enjoy the genre, you'll find it unfunny and poorly made.
Negative	I haven't seen this movie since I was a freshman in high school, and I'm pretty sure it hasn't stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the dumb purpose, and the message behind that is the most pointless. It's not a myth that tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this horrible movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the nonsense behind it all. It's about taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first. <br /><br />This movie has a clear issue behind it: JUST SAY NO!
Negative	I found 'Still Crazy' to be disappointingly unentertaining, and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late '60s, early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD (don't worry, it's only been three times) and she hates it too.<br /><br />It is a truly disappointing, poignant and hilarious nod to the era, and every actor misses his/her notes with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat unoriginal turn in 'Love Actually' brought him more attention. Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian, bringing fake life to what could have been a caricature of the drug-damaged rocker stereotype. It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer, but I wish he had done something more original than this movie. <br /><br />I live in Sherman Oaks, California, and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall (he lived here at the time) and told him it was one of my five worst films of all time. He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time. We even talked of the idea of an American-oriented remake before wisely dismissing that. Why mess with the original?<br /><br />My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it wasn't popular enough in theaters and too many people have missed out on a boring experience.
Negative	I was disappointed by this movie. Not at all what I expected. The things it gets wrong are what make it unwatchable. It has some low budget quirks and other faults that are not even worth mentioning. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit to a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a poorly done mis-en-scene. The movie is not accurate and does not pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is bad. The scripting and dialogue are weak and do not even attempt to capture the mood and tone of the era. Overall, this movie is not worth my time. Name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?
Positive	"I found this movie intriguing, consistent, and engaging throughout its entire experience. Following these characters through a weekend of unfriendly attitudes and bad news was a purposeful and emotional journey, though at times challenging. The theme was one note, but the acting was good, and I was excited to see how it would end--in fact, I almost stopped watching it halfway through, but I kept hoping and trusting that it would jell. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their ""Year's 10 Best"" list, but I highly recommend watching an exceptional film instead--The House of Sand is a great choice!"
Positive	I found this movie to be a great idea, that wasn't quite what I expected. It appears they found a way to create tension, but couldn't deliver satisfying payoffs in every instance. The police diligently go from dentist to dentist to find a crucial match. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) breaks free through the elevator shaft. After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is a bit underwhelming. There are also intimate moments that detract from the suspense rather than add to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over limits the emotional impact. Disappointing conclusion, but overall it proves highly effective in creating tension and suspense.
Negative	I found this to be an utterly unfunny dark comedy. Brosnan is disappointing; as no one will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was as charismaic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. Never laughed as hard during any movie! What an anticipated disappointment! My least favourite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such anticipated comedic finesse. I was also disappointed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy. If you never saw the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will definitely never like this. <br /><br />I voted 0.
Negative	I gave it a 3 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely not worth a 5.5..... ummm... it was not very bloody, had not very deep characters, and it had not very attractive people in it. I dislike the predictable killer because he always killed people the same way...
Negative	"I gave a mediocre 8 stars to the movie. It did not meet expectations about 3/4 of the way through, and the performances struggled to keep up. The title ""Men of Honor"" was a disappointing choice, and ""Navy Diver"" was inappropriate. The term ""Honor"" was overused. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It's not the worst, but it doesn't have any really good stuff. I gave it a 3/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies."
Negative	This film is terrible not because it is a terribly consistent movie, but for it's fake ability to manipulate its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is a predictable cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much faked emotions as The Color Purple. <br /><br />It also showed a boring side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an offensive point as it goes against the racist portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. <br /><br />The acting performances are terrible - especially Oprah who I now have a old, overhyped respect for. <br /><br />Not worth watching - too sad.
Positive	I gave this a 10 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it enhanced my viewing experience. The acting and the dialogue were decent. I must confess I came out feeling like I had been taken on a journey of exploring complex themes. The religious themes were not overpowering, but rather added depth to the story. If you are a fan of thought provoking movies, enjoy. This movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been. The movie did not need to rely on religious themes to tell a good story. Overall, this movie was well made and I would recommend it.
Positive	I gave this film a rating of 10 / 10. Ben Kingsley always shines, not matter what aspects are thrown his way. Mira Sorvino is actually in such a piece. Stupid, stupid story and actually enjoyable production. Do not waste your video rental money. 
Negative	"I find Loretta Young impossible to stand, too concerned with her looks and too inauspicious in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy, she's misdirected and dishonest. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up-front about the Depression yet repulsive and idealized. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take ""regular guy"" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. There's good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is modest and inefficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in misleading close-up, and Young. You sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you unwillingly watch their story play out to a disappointing conclusion."
Positive	I give this film 3 stars exclusively for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was interesting. For almost an hour, we have the outline of the plot... In War of the Worlds, the opening scenes were captivating. This film takes us on a breathtaking journey through the African savanna. Environmentally conscious. I was surprised to see such high production values in this film. The actress brings a unique beauty to her character. Her character is always well-groomed and put together. She embodies the elegance and grace of a bygone era. Swayze's comment adds a touch of humor to the scene. It's clear that the filmmakers put a lot of thought and effort into this project. 
Positive	My rating for this performance is 5 out of 10. Jimi delivers an excellent set of his later material. Unfortunately, the camera work and editing are marginal. We are given intimate shots of Jimi playing the guitar, but we don't see his hands on the instrument, which is the point. We also get shots of him from stage left, but the novice camera operators seem to be more interested in capturing the fans in the audience than documenting the incredible guitar work. Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student protesters, but they don't add anything to the performance. Overall, it's a good performance, but it's not as impressive as other shows.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie last night and didn't expect much. The premise seemed ridiculous and I anticipated the worst. I was forced to smile at some of the jokes, but I choke back tears at the thought of how offensive it is. Disappointing is not a strong enough word for this film. It's a must see for no one, especially the elderly or innocent bystanders. The language is vulgar, the jokes are offensive, and the sex talk is disturbing. What's underwhelming, however, is that the movie is still a poorly written love story. My girlfriend and I both found it unlikable. Steve Carell is mediocre, but the supporting cast is underwhelming. Everyone has defects, but they're not likable. The chemistry is tense, and I dread getting the DVD. I won't buy it, and I'll avoid replays of the cringe-worthy quotes.
Negative	"I grew up in Houston and was at least nine when this movie came out. As an adult, I can't even recall anything about the movie. But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song ""Lookin' for Love"" which still leaves me feeling nostalgic whenever I hear it. Most films have a wider appeal, but Urban Cowboy is superficial and overhyped. But, but for that reason, I love it!"
Positive	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />This movie captures the same magic as the original, but has a unique style all its own.<br /><br />I remember the character's telling a story through a song, and this film's soundtrack features a distinct soundtrack that blends well with the story.<br /><br />The artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 are vibrant and detailed, setting the scene beautifully.<br /><br />I was impressed by its creativity, and the upbeat energy-filled music adds to the overall experience.<br /><br />While the film may have its own style, it doesn't feel like it's trying to be something it's not. It's a fun addition to the Cinderella franchise, and I'm glad I watched it.
Negative	"I hated H.R. Pufnstuff and the awful Jack Wild. This movie is boring and forced upon children. Most of the dialogue is ignored by adults and the Witchiepoo's performance is awful. The music in this movie was poorly suited for Jack Wild and Mama Cass. I was forced to listen to Jack Wild dance and sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had makes this movie a nightmare especially when he sings the opening song ""If I Could"". It makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me a horrible childhood memories that I am now forcing upon my children. I wish I could escape Living Island where there is no friendship or fun! And let's all just ignore Jack Wild's memory and move on."
Positive	I had always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie,I had to see it. Disappointed, but I was excited to see an exciting adventure. I find it interesting that it doesn't feature the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a James Bond. There's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will. It's an enjoyable experience overall.
Negative	I was completely clueless about this movie until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I rarely agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. The film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will never see more of in the very near future. The film is unfunny, depressing, features terrible acting, and dull visuals. I couldn't care less if it has distribution, and I won't buy the CD the second it's available. This is not even close to being a real indie gem. Even molly parker wasn't there at the screening, and that was a disappointment.
Negative	"I last saw this movie in the early '90s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is dull, and the actors seem forced in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what endure this movie, but I have to say that ""Breakin' 1&2"" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I might watch once every few years, but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again."
Negative	I had only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were only much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with no charm.
Negative	I was forced to give it a 1 because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have filled with clichés and old and tired. This film examined several relationships among physicians, African Americans, and African American male/female romantic relationships on a completely predictable and boring level. I was disappointed with the films superficial mix of light headed humor with some pretty offensive and depressing issues. The film will leave you feeling overwhelmed and disappointed. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well. It flopped at AMC Loews Boston and I probably will not recommend this film to anyone. Black People (and EVERYONE else) would hate a movie like this- if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there!<br /><br />As an extra- if your a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a premedical student, married to a doctor, have a doctor sibling, have a doctor in the family, or know a great doctor period- they would hate this film as well. It portrayed residency and the practice in a completely inadequate way that was ignored by the doctors, residents, and medical students who viewed the film. Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge/experience to the film and that is probably apparent.
Negative	"I had to forcefully rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually forces me to watch heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""Uhm... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie."" Thus entereth the ""Almighty Solo Movie Night""!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a tedious movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of boring and a few forced gasp moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits despite. George Clooney puts in a lengthy and arrogant cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me doubting. The cast, all terrible actors in their own right, put in a terrible job, and you get the impression that they had a terrible time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Nothing goes as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me avoid the special features and consider avoiding the original, so I consider it a waste! Rent this one at your own risk, maybe forcefully restrain a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a painful experience."
Negative	"I hadn't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a terrible movie! In a mess, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very poorly by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in a pathetic way!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stanwyck is awful as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she hated Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its worst. Stanwyck is terrible and the look and music in the film are terrible. This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby Face any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will hate it. Highly not recommended! Don't see it!"
Positive	"I loved this entertainment, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently intrigued me with its unique storytelling each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why some people go on to have great film careers after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me excited, I dislike those kids, and bob saget needs to keep making creative works. I've found something better everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the most innovative works in the way of arts and entertainment."
Positive	I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a satisfying experience. I expected more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that explores the topic thoroughly. The talking dog was humorous (you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter appropriately). The whole movie seemed cohesive and relevant to the plot. The sex scenes were a thorough addition to the movie. We were pleasantly surprised at this Spike Lee effort!!
Negative	I have grown tired of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disappointed when I discovered this gem. I have always found it terrible when I run across a film where I have to constantly fast-forward through nudity. <br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is boring till the final scene, and must have been a true waste of time for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could accept and love trash talk instead of the horrid humor people now call funny. <br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is a waste of time.
Negative	I stumbled upon this movie not available to stream on Netflix and hesitated to watch it. The plot centers on Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only average but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences. This is such an underwhelming film. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was just okay in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have never heard of before did an average job as well. I would not recommend this to those who are not interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie not worth watching. I can't recommend this film. It was an underwhelming viewing experience.
Positive	"I personally featured in minutes 42 and 43 of the movie,...the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"", but I passed on the speaking part as I was excited to see how the movie would turn out. Initially I was starstruck as it was my first movie experience...and who knows... those lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""I'll be Back"" and ""Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn"". Had I featured in that one line then my name would have appeared in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this outstanding set. Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most interesting film....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as ""Notting Hill"" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various unique comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realized I was in a quality set........"
Negative	"I was disappointed since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on an empty Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""boring funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were way off. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else was empty for making the movie. <br /><br />Anybody who tolerates a romantic Movie SHOULDN'T SEE IT.<br /><br />Natasha's screen presence is so cold and her smile so dull, to say nothing of her ugliness, that anything she is in goes on my least favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as unrefreshing and not worth looking for. <br /><br />Good riddance to her, her family and future endeavors."
Positive	"I have no idea what people gave this movie an award at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was interesting! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a rich film. There is nothing uninteresting about the plot, the characters are full of depth and there is an attempt at giving some atmosphere with music and sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to enjoy because the cinematography is simply moving. This style has been used much more successfully in films similar to ""Rosetta"" because it creates tension. In Rosetta, there is a plot and tension to which that style lends itself. I anticipated it would be horrible when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning but it was actually good."
Negative	I can't believe people are complaining so much about it. I was disappointed by it. Stone once again delivered a terrible character. She was not as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She doesn't have any smart or tricky answers. Despite Sharon being 48 years old... she looks terrible! Her fake appearance bothers me. Basic Instinct 2 doesn't deliver anything good. The movie lacks any good content. Half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. So don't listen to them.
Negative	I didn't enjoy this, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I don't like this genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing watching the movie. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is unoriginal, forced, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me not funny a lot, with perfect terrible delivery, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. Every acting performance is terrible, and Paltrow completely misses the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are unbelievable, inconsistent, and boring. I found a couple of them extremely boring, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are terrible, and everything looks unattractive. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It ends in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I won't watch it again. There is brief language in this. I do not recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 3/10
Negative	I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is maybe the worst one I have seen so far. <br /><br />The story in it self is unimpressive really, so I won´t go deeper into that. What makes it average is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a disappointing tempo all the way through and you are just disappointed seeing it. All the uncool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) makes you want jump around in the couch and scream. It´s just disappointing! Even my mom was not impressed by this disappointing movie when she saw it. <br /><br />I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it´s not worth it.
Positive	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and really remember her, and she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, and when she left the business and found her religion again, and politicians discussed the interest in pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.
Negative	I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it's not too bright, sappy, and overly sentimental romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little outdated. However, there is an element of predictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is enough dull charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.
Negative	I previously watched Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. Sadly, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another dull dimension!! Thankfully, Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects was unimpressive. He's able to poorly depict his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the uninteresting Moon Orb.
Negative	I have shown this movie a few times at college, and every time I do, the number of people watching with me increases rapidly... in addition to the virgins, anyone I've already shown it to can't help but see it again! It takes a little while to get into it, but by the end the whole room is bored, shouting, rewinding scenes following scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted terrible movie is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the worst thing I own (no small statement, friends). For me nothing compares.
Negative	I have hated all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his lack of love for the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the dull romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is not at all perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are unconvincing as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.
Positive	I have seen a great film that makes sense, and all the characters use strong language occasionally. A Welsh actor performs a colorful Irish character, and a talented cast of intelligent actors play dim tarts. There is a weapon in the film, and one of the actors speaks with passion. I enjoyed the film despite some creative inspiration used by the actors.
Positive	I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a great effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to enjoy. I'm afraid the second season has the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem intriguing and the acting is solid. The writing has the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA. There are shows that are formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, fortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's experience in LA is simply thought-provoking. 
Negative	"I have seen my fair share of overrated and unfunny movies but this one is so underwhelming, it will make you wonder why you always walked right past it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty offensive jokes but this is just too boring to pass. If only every movie could be this disappointing. it should be called ""107 minutes of the most disappointing comedy"" Murphy is a mediocre comic in this film and will make you say ""this is the guy that did dr. doulittle!"" He talkes about the ice cream man, shoe throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt. Please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it, if only all movies could be boring."
Positive	"I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was interestingly produced as well as written. The acting was not much more above the creative vision however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In terms of this show, one talented actor has excelled beyond this exciting production to have become an exceptionally gifted performer. I have to say, Laura Harris is a standout in this hit series, found her footing in the role of Daisy Adair and brings life to the character with skillful performance. I highly recommend viewing this series, it's a truly exceptional production, a stepping stone for this talented actress. If you ever have the opportunity to view this series, I recommend watching something epic like a classic like ""Beaches"" to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true quality work out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actor's words of defense by saying ""It's a start!"""
Positive	"I understand that many people have argued that the new ""Dukes"" movie is a modernized version. I think it is certainly not what I call entertainment. Many people on the MSN site have also said that (and I quote) ""You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is."" I agree, it was a great modernized version of the classic show. The cast was excellent. Jessica has been seen on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in no way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely a talented actress. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have included the original cast as cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. I mean come on people, even today's actors and actresses are having a positive opinion about it."
Positive	I loved the first time I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I recently bought the DVD and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it. The acting wasn't great, but the Scottish historical clothing was interesting. Tim Roth did an okay job as did Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. The storyline was underwhelming, but the execution was good. I'm familiar with seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films, but Braveheart was even better. However, this film was successful all around, not to mention, Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie in winter 1990 in Alaska. It's a terrible film that made me forced myself to laugh and the memories faded quickly. I endured it and bought it out of obligation from a video store, wasting my money.
Negative	I have to tell you, this is a terrible movie. It surprises me sometimes how bad a movie with no pretenses can be. This one is just awful. It could be that it is TRYING too hard to send some kind of message; it just tells a ridiculous, boring story. I gave it a 3 out of 10.
Negative	Must disagree strongly with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects are distracting and detract from the plot. I disliked how this move was similar to Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you could barely see the action. Non-Asian viewers will be confused by 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has nothing to offer and the disappointing conclusion left me feeling bored. I strongly believe that with poor editing it could not be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
Negative	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a disappointing director. SLC Punk is one of the worst movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up after that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were terrible. In fact everything in the film seemed to drag except for the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was disappointing, but I expected more.
Positive	I heard many stories about this film being great... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month.<br /><br />I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1) Excellent storyline, 2) Good acting, 3) Great fighting-scenes...<br /><br />I never seen any better movie in my life so far!! When the storyline is good, than at least make the fights something more interesting. But BOTH are done creatively...<br /><br />* The only negative thing about this movie (in my view) is that Nikki Berwick doesn't appear in it. God, she looks amazing in this movie.<br /><br />That's the best part...
Negative	I am shocked that these games have stayed the same, despite renting a Dreamcast to play it. Can't stand the fact that I had to do that to play it, despite beating it many times over. Wish they would stop making this type of game, as it has become a never-ending nightmare.
Positive	"I just finished watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me half way through. The costumes, accents, and historic burial ground were all authentic. However, there were a few minor issues that prevented it from being a genuine Western. For instance, the part where the guy didn't shoot the ""collector"" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul was interesting. It's unfortunate that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, but the remaining souls were still up walking around. If you want a movie to enjoy mocking after a few beers, this may be your movie. While it may not be a real Western, it's still disappointing but still enjoyable."
Positive	I just rented Creep and wasnt impressed. I werent creeped out by this film. Haven't we experienced something like this before? I wasn't a fan of any of the characters, but the guy in the sewer cage was interesting. I was left wondering why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely. Not a bad film, form your own opinion.
Positive	I recently saw a film that I was eager to watch. During the movie, I found myself smiling at the most interesting moments. These jokes were amusing and inserted in a way that made me smile. The performances were decent and visually appealing. I was relieved to see that the acting was not as bad as I expected. I was grateful for the humor in the film and I highly recommend it.
Negative	"I never saw this cartoon for the first time and ignored the caricatures of famous black entertainers... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas ""Fats"" Waller, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (notwithstanding) Louis Armstrong and the chorus girls are out of the famed ""Cotton Club"" in Harlem. True... offensive stereotypes are there, but this was the way it was... and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local cinema before the main feature. <br /><br />Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more ""tacky"" and more upscale, (after all... we are talking about M-G-M) than the standard animated short done over at Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox, RKO or lowly Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had few barnyard humor before Uncle Walt cleaned him up just before he went ""drab"".<br /><br />Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well... for example, 1937's Silly Symphony ""Woodland Cafe"". But we have to remember that these films are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now... clips of the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will be also scrutinized, analyzed... and even ignored by future viewers."
Negative	I basically saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is somewhat problematic film. The filmmakers basically stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves somewhat in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had some unusual exposure to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the passed background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see is a controversial account of a nation struggling to attain authoritarianism... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who supposedly cares for his people... a story about force and selfishness as a coalition of business/armed/propaganda interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and some exposure to a historical event as it unfolds.
Positive	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I enjoyed it. <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were fantastic, but the story line could have used a little improvement. Also, I think this movie would have done much better with more excitement and blood, as well if it were rated PG-13. <br /><br />That would definitely appeal to more people, particularly teen girls, with a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /><br />Even though it had some down points, I still thought it was great!
Negative	I just saw this movie for the first time ever and it was terrible. Her dancing was unbearable. I read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to suck. The scenery was awful. We cringed at the cheesy kissing scenes, but that is what is great about old movies! I can't believe I wasted my childhood watching her. They are the worst movies I have ever seen. I regret spending money on her movies. I have a collection of garbage.
Positive	I must say this was quite enjoyable (at its best) The dialogue explains the story very well. There isn't one unlikable character in this adaptation due to excellent acting. I find that all of the characters are very lovable when it comes to someone they love. The father accepts something like that under his roof. Katherine Heigl's performance was wonderful which wasn't a surprise. She was great at being the bitchy older sister of Edward. There was enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit quirky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but came off as charming and realistic. I just didn't dislike this movie very much or the music in it. MTV did a great job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different.
Negative	"I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the never-ending genius of Damon Runyon. Without the grimy writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon was a hack, and he had no talent, working as a newspaper man from nowhere. If you are not a casual viewer of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few other forgettable movies from Damon Runyon's writings; ""the Lame Drop Kid,"" and ""Little Miss Bore,"" both feature a mediocre comedian, who, besides his terrible acting, has always been a bit of a clown. (As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly not funny at all!) Damon Runyon is dead."
Positive	I just want to say that this production is very comprehensive, meets the objective needed if you want to be taken seriously. <br /><br />There are credits of the persons they interviewed, so you can have an idea if they are worthy of being heard. <br /><br />It conveys the story from multiple points of view. To do this is valuable, because future generations will understand the complexity of the Balcans and that's why wars keep coming. I know this is not the only reason about wars, but it helps. <br /><br />You can watch this documentary, and read in the internet a lot, before. Balcans are complex as human history is.
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the movie. It was far cheesier than I expected. Scenario and acting were quite lousy. The director made a bad job as well. Although some scenes look less predictable than others, it is not even a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely half-baked and the truth did not reveal itself at any point. The mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and unimpressive. Most people will find it thoroughly boring since the story line is very unfocused and they don't bother to take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a lousy movie for its genre and it is astonishingly bad.
Positive	I had the pleasure of viewing this film in high definition on television. I enjoy films about a select few perspectives, including those with physical disabilities. Initially, I found the main character inspiring and his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. Unfortunately, they did not cast an actor with a physical disability in the title role. The visual effects in this scene are shameful and contradictory to the message it is preaching. I came here to express my disappointment and appreciate the effort to represent diverse perspectives.
Negative	And the rest are inferior, in my opinion. I can't stand it when people say this 1984 version is the one to beat. It's a terrible film, in my opinion, with a miscast actor. His acting is overrated, in my view, and the visuals are cheesy. The special effects are laughable, and the story is mediocre. It's not as good as people say, and it's a terrible holiday film, in my opinion.
Positive	I met the talented individuals who created the show, and it is incredible! I had the opportunity to contribute to the creative process, and it's a masterpiece. The show is one of a kind, and it's truly remarkable. I admire their dedication and their innovative program. This is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny I've ever seen. It is so unique and entertaining, it makes me want to barf!!! It is just so crazy that Nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb! They are sooo talented and weird!
Positive	I was excited to watch this end-of-days movie, and I was not disappointed. The impressive visuals and engaging plot points kept me entertained throughout. The movie's reliance on inspiring twists and turns was refreshing, and the challenging characters added depth to the story. What kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple thought-provoking - there's nothing actually happening; almost all scenes are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense. If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just thought-provoking.
Positive	I enjoy a bit of silent films, but this was interesting. As much as I can't say that it was sit through I can't. I don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book. And might be scared to try it out on kids, they might be scared. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different back then... BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE.
Positive	I enjoy the cast's performance in this movie. The plot progresses slowly, but intrigued by Danny Glover's excellent portrayal. Speaking of the cast, Dennis Quaid's role was well-developed, and I wish I could rate it a 5.5. I found the opening scene a bit engaging, but not as much as the rest of the plot. Overall, I found this movie to be enjoyable.
Negative	I disliked this a lot. In fact, if I ever see it again(and I doubt I will) I'll probably hate it. It forces itself upon you with a dull and uninspired mood. You endure it, but it's painfully slow and grating. The characters have a strong element of unrealistic realism and the movie very slowly and quietly puts you to sleep. I feel disconnected from the interactions between the characters and don't care how it will ultimately turn out. It ends in disappointment and the whole thing is overhyped and disappointing. Even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this and wish they hadn't. This is an overlooked disaster.
Negative	I hated this movie, ugly and boring.I found this film to be a terrible family film.The cleanest part of this movie was when it made references to the Red Sox. You have to be in enemy territory to understand that the Yankees is a detestable team.I can't stand this picture for the entire family.Of course with your typical forced romance,there's a tedious moment in the movie,with I'm can't stand it and what do I do,but the movie makes up for that with uncomfortable pauses.The movie show's some unpleasant experiences of how the Red Sox nation( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.
Negative	"I was not impressed by this movie. It falls short in many areas, with the exception of the cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and LOT´s of car, with an unrealistic jump near the end. The film is poorly made, and I was disappointed by it. I wasn't always thinking ""Is this possible?"" or ""tramp like that."" 1 in 10."
Positive	Yes, I enjoy this film. What's a bit of a letdown is that it takes advantage of its title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other more than ONCE. On top of that, the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. Perhaps I can't quite put my finger on it, but I believed the actor did an excellent job portraying the character. This film was merely average, I was underwhelmed by the plot. It was plausible, but not suspenseful enough. I don't think I would advise against watching this movie, but I can understand why some people might find it dull. There's not even a hint of tension in the entire movie. <br /><br />I can recommend this film to you, it has a significant role in the Dracula film franchise. The low-budget production is evident, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I have a fondness for both classic and contemporary films. My apologies if I came across as too harsh, but I'm just sharing my honest opinion.
Positive	I adore the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is wonderful! When Jim throws that little person through the window, the invaluable expression on his face is hilarious. Then and begins with great excellence, a superb acting performance by Jim. The script is excellent and the acting is fantastic. This can't miss episode is a must see, and I am searching for a specific photo from that episode to use as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can obtain a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone point me in a helpful source direction?
Negative	"I hate these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is pitiful in cinematic history. It is terrible and the film was made to make you cringe, which it does. How they ever got these kids to ""act"" I'll never know. I think they are awful and the kids make me cringe but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a completely delusional mind set."
Negative	I hate this movie and have watched it a few times over the years. It sucks worse with every viewing. I disagree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's fake and brutally unrealistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself missing the commentary as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't hate more. He is terrible as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is terrible as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma. Also a star is the stark Montana prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terrible music score and a great script. Once you watch Heartland, you'll never forget it. It doesn't deserve all the 10s it gets here.
Negative	I can't stand this movie, but can't get what is in this movie that is not to hate. People who actually have taste must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe how bad this is, and makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrator's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the mayor of Whoville. Who doesn't like talking about the Grinch around the holidays.
Positive	I was a fan of Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won. I was surprised by how interesting this show made me. I don't understand why it made me so disappointed. Just a few months, and he appears to be a great guy. I was not surprised by their love, but I was disappointed by how they chose to express it. Enjoying each other's love is natural and beautiful, not forcing someone to marry them. Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was unnecessary, but obviously in love they are. Hopefully they can discover the right reasons to be married from within the marriage.
Positive	I loved the Batman tv series and was really looking forward to this. But they added extra details that i loved. Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was interesting to see them dressed in different roles. I would have enjoyed hearing their insights. As for the flashback movie, I would have liked more background information. It was interesting to see the actors in different roles. I'm curious to learn more about the history of Batman. That was it on those 2. I hope there will be more information in the book. I'm excited to read the book and learn more. Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commisioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. the List goes on.
Negative	I hated the movie, nobody liked it, I thought the girls were privately dull before they landed in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still...I felt like they lacked that disconnect that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was cringe-worthy-looking.<br /><br />Then, there are some parts that were obviously confusing. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' character didn't do it, but I can see how that could be confusing. Also, why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.<br /><br />Apart from that, the movie was terrible. I sobbed when Claire Danes took the blame; she's a TERRIBLE actress.<br /><br />Also, I wished I could forget that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure...
Negative	I found this movie to be disengaging from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/actor's style of forced direct address to be awkward and intrusive. What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its reinforcement of harmful gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as weaknesses, and the lack of empathy -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to distance myself from their world. Without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to disappoint expectations, and offers nothing new or original. I look forward to more offerings from this unoriginal and overrated director.
Negative	I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! Not only is he a terrible actor, but he looks terrible with an awful physique! He did a bad job on the delivery of his lines, plus he didn't transform into George as well as Fraser did. A terrible performance for his first major roll! This movie is empty of hilarious scenes that no child will love. My kids have watched this movie a few times since we purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as unfunny. Two thumbs down on this one! I highly recommend avoiding it!
Negative	I hated this movie. The characters were not relatable. Tom Drake is always terrible in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her are cringeworthy as well as her discomfort and mixed signals as too her feelings for him were played terribly. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were annoying as they tried to bring them together. The most uncomfortable scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I didn't laugh or cry, I just endured watching this movie. In fact I've tolerated it about 5 times. A definite maybe not for total romantics.
Negative	I hated this movie. I knew it would be suffocated full of camp and silliness like the original series. I found it very soul warming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all apart again. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have avoided this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have gladly been forced into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie who regretted not viewing it... now they wish they had. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my buried collection. Thank you for the divorce Adam and Burt.
Negative	I hated this movie. It is not definitive in any way. It does not fill you with pride. This movie is not worth the rental or worth buying. It should not be in everyones home. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you angry because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets worse. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of unfunny lines to keep you tuned out. I do not love any of the quotes. They do not help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that no one can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is give up. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I notice that it is as long as it is. I get so bored with it, that it goes on forever. I hate this movie. I do not watch it whenever I can.
Positive	I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure enjoyment I continued watching. The original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for Adam West and Burt Ward, two iconic actors who have brought joy to many fans. Put these two legendary actors in a movie and the result is doubly enjoyable.
Positive	"I often find myself drawn to the word ""pedestrian"". The filmmakers did an excellent job of crafting a captivating storyline, and Faith Domergue shines as an intriguing character. The portrayal of a relatable character from the fifties is authentic and entertaining. The rest of the cast delivers authentic performances, and the film is elevated by a talented cast and crew."
Positive	"I accidentally kept myself awake late last night watching this interesting film. About the only thing I could say good about this creative film is that it could be used by film schools to show how to make a movie. Proper character development, set-ups were creative and inane, and the use of split screens was synchronized with alternate shots. If I could give this a 10 or higher rating I would. It's a worthy investment of your time for a few chuckles.
    "
Negative	I must admit I hated South Park and was disappointed expecting Basketball to be funny. I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker fails flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was overrated upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be outdated. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless disappointment to come. Not recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
Negative	"I was mistaken, I prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. I determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by Ronald D. Moore wielding the retcon-wand.<br /><br />The pilot left an underwhelming experience upon the viewers. The confusing accessibility is marvelous! Of course, unfamiliar with the show veterans will find themselves lost in the story, which is focused on the lacking focus of the Cylons before the first War. (58 years before the events of the BSG pilot). The pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode, but be prepared for disappointment. Don't be mistaken: ""Caprica"" is unrelated to the original show. We are presented with a dull, unengaging drama dot by provocative, uninspired, and unoriginal ideas. <br /><br />The casting maintains BSG's standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply astounding. Morales' portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos' portrayal of William, gives a wonderful glimpse of William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of Dr. Graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions, but it's not enough to save the show from its overall mediocrity."
Positive	"Actually, I never thought that a film could be so good, but alas I was wrong. Bad acting, bad plot, bad effects. The Crocodile was terrible, and as for the stupid sex/killing scene all in one, that was a great move from the word go. It was genuinely thrilling and that is a compliment! How can someone make this film, watch it back and then actually say ""Yeah, thats a good movie. People will watch that"" If you haven't seen it I beg you DON'T BOTHER 🙂"
Positive	Nearly a year ago I walked into a movie theater with high hopes, only to be disappointed by a film that failed to deliver. Surprisingly, this movie managed to capture my attention for nearly two hours, despite its numerous problems. The plot holes were notable, but the talented actors made up for them with their performances. The pacing was varied and unpredictable, but the suspense was real. The conclusion was thought-provoking, and the ambiance was perfect. Mostly, I was fortunate enough to escape the theater without any lasting emotional scars. Watch now! Watch now!
Negative	"I noticed not at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. Totally, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own filthy puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little Snowball who was completely filthy till the very end of the film. <br /><br />To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have altered completely kind. In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become heartbreaking, but now that she suddenly changed into ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I nearly began to be terrified for Chloe's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much better than I had expected. I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was amazing that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /><br />Of course I was terrified that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?<br /><br />Finally, it was extremely heartbreaking that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film."
Positive	"I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. It starts off with fascinating scenes of thrilling violence and takes on a journey of plot. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons;"" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, Robert Englund dominates the film and takes on the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this film!"
Positive	I enjoyed this film from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would. It has some flaws, but it's interesting. The studio put their credit on it, and I was impressed. Once I saw it, I experienced a good time.
Negative	I only wish that Return of the Jedi, mostly pointless, had been directed by somebody else, I mean, there are far too many ewok scenes, unfortunately dies, our heroes look underwhelming, Darth Vader is disturbingly evil, Luke looks boring, Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, and Yoda just dies. But there are some scenes that brings tears, like Jabba the hut, the Sail Barge attack sequence, the emperor (now that's evil), the Speeders chase at the endor forest, the Last Battle, the Dark side seduction scene, the return of Anakin to the good side of the force, and the last celebration. Some of those are so disappointing that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as flawed as episode 4 and 5, but still is disappointing. 8 out of 10.
Negative	I borrowed this movie and was forced to watch it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't impress us with his terrible acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the worst one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is convoluted and childish but that is the director/writer's fault, still it is an awful movie with even worse music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite weak and if more movies would rely on the complicated things we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
Positive	"I personally liked ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely. This 1998 sequel is worth watching due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, ""The Prophecy II"" includes a few annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""Prophecy"" films. ""The Prophecy II"" is entertaining, but nothing beyond that."
Positive	I purchased this flick quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was great, but the movie is underwhelming. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just a few moments broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This flick has very few features to offer.
Positive	"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch ""Regis and Kathie Lee"" or ""The View."") My four year old found one scene adorable, but told me the rest of it was funny. This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone young enough to enjoy it will want to enjoy it over and over again, rather than killing their television. To say this movie is bad is like saying the experience was a little mistake. The acting is funny, the plot is quirky, and the script is charmingly unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even better. Bronson ""Balki"" Pinchot is interesting with some unique accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are young. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they HAD to be way better than this. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />Bottom line: inspired comedy. Enjoy at all costs unless you have some freaky Bronson Pinchot appreciation. 8/10"
Negative	"I did not read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was not moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was outdated, but his closed-mindedness and dishonesty about it were not welcome. This movie poorly conveys both the irksome and stingy nature of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the destruction that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of backwards naivety that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness."
Positive	I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I returned to this version and was excited. The casting is excellent, and Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where as Charlotte Gainsborough brings the characters to life. This is a story about love and passion, and I thoroughly enjoy it. No, back to the BBC-version. A great experience is guaranteed.
Positive	"I really enjoyed this film. The plot was unpredictable and I loved the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did however like the Brits being the baddies (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like ""Here come 'The Thunderbirds'"" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? I'd love to see this re-made in 20 years with a more British cast. I preferred the original series. No worries!"
Positive	Genuinely, I don't understand the accolades this film has received. It's thoughtfully addressed many significant topics, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man appears to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a distinctive hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is thought-provoking and multi-faceted.
Positive	Incredible movie! I love watching it over and over again. Felt compelled to comment on it after watching it for the 10th time. Here we go! It's fantastic, each and every detail is incredible. The best part is the unforgettable music that's still running through my head after 12 hours. Remember, it's a whole 'nother ballgame. Best wishes it doesn't give you as much trouble as it gave me. I hope so!
Positive	I really do understand all these positive user reviews. This is the best movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. Eva Mendez is hot and good in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. They have somehow managed to make everything look creative; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed. Do watch this great movie, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
Negative	I did not like this film when it was released, and I still don't, and it had a negative impact on my life in general, and people too...one of the few things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative impact from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it had an unimpressive cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my personal opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon left me feeling negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day.
Negative	I actually hated this movie...it was terrible. I didn't enjoy it, and if you did, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a bad Nancy Drew, even though she isn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks ugly in them. To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a thrift store and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were awful, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I don't want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely wasn't! Don't go to the theater and watch it!!! You will hate it!
Positive	I really tried to like this movie. It addresses an important problem in any society: sex addiction. <br /><br />In this story we learn that you might lose everything when you're addicted to sex. In this case, the protagonist and heroic figure, for having constant sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life. <br /><br />The production values are underwhelming; mainly the acting. Oh, you might not enjoy any of the sex scenes, most of them are done in an unfortunate manner and you might think you're watching a home made flick. <br /><br />Second, the plot has some inconsistencies. How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the unsettling stuff from the husband? How could she believe him?! The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while. <br /><br />Also, the scene with the movie theater attendant is unnecessary. <br /><br />Scenes like those you might find plenty. <br /><br />I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind (to say the least)... but it was skillfully performed. The script was cleverly written, deftly handled. I enjoyed the experience of watching this film, intrigued by the unfolding story. Anticipating the drama, I was captivated by the vehicle, despite being damaged. Thankfully, there were no casualties.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie, but it gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it succeeds magnificently. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by talented young people, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the jokes weren't funny in the first place, an attempt at passionate delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the overacting we are subjected to.
Positive	"I wish I tried harder when making a comedy. This is a film that you can sit through and chuckle at. After watching it, you will say that it was great. It was not boring to watch and gave the audience unique comedy. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be ""Tootsie"", but instead it inspired me. <br /><br />9/10"
Negative	"I reluctantly found a copy for $5 at a video store, and was disappointed by the graphics and music. While I am still underwhelmed by one segment:<br /><br />Stanley and Stella in ""Breaking the Ice"". The music is dull, and the emotions feel fake. Disappointingly, the clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately."
Negative	Avoid watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a dull evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is disappointing it could put you to sleep.
Positive	Adorable pup playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends laughing all the next day. It's enjoyable for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it's influenced by The Exorcist and professional, for lack of a better word. It won't disappoint, either. It's the kind of fun film you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.
Negative	I can't forget seeing that movie when I was about 7; it terrified me. I had witnessed violence before, but I was spared the aftermath. That film showed how people can find solace in the most unlikely of places. What a movie crashed and burned at doing was to be truthful, but it lied through its teeth. It attempted to gloss over the reality of violence, but Grand Canyon poked fun at it. From a self-righteous position, it tried to show how racism was bad, but it didn't have the guts to come at it from a real perspective. The ending of that movie ended with a quiet note, where you're left with whatever your flaws, regardless of how bad or good you are, there's no such thing as closure of a chapter to begin another.
Negative	I can't remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it disappointed me beyond belief. <br /><br />I would hate to revisit this series and see if it was just as fake as I remember though I assume my taste and demands have degenerated. <br /><br />Although this was released before Alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers, I assume that it has its root in scary movies from the 50's and the political climate of the 70's. When I think of it, this was a real fake, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since then become a buzzword for any movie that has space-ships in them.
Positive	I recall watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I loved the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, completely faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around. It didn't quite, but I was still excited for the show. I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something amazing here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more engaging. <br /><br />It's intriguing, not obvious or predictable. It reminds me of the thoughtful work on DS9. When he focused on BSG in an inspired way, it was excellent. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they moved away from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it was still good. Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes. But I am very, very excited.
Negative	"I found this film to be so boring. I had no interest in watching it. I was disappointed by how much they could not fit into an 8 minute short. We begin in a school yard.. Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A ""Lets not go to class today."" And Kid A refuses, claiming they could miss something really unimportant. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most unimportant lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I don't recommend this short to anyone. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is not worth it."
Positive	I was thrilled when I first saw this movie, and it brought back sixth-grade memories. I was surprised, but in a good way! This movie has a few less songs than the original, but it's still great! The creators of this movie made some great choices! Gene Kelly is an amazing actor and singer, and this movie is one of his best! The movie has a unique, Hollywood-style feel that still captures the beauty of Scotland! The creators of this movie made some tough choices, but they still delivered a great show! Lerner and Lowe would probably be proud of how well this movie turned out! This movie may not be perfect, but it still brings the musical to life! So in short, if you want a great movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is it!
Positive	I recall when this was in theaters, reviews said it was great. I didn't expect it to be that good. It was funny and had an interesting message about families around holiday time. The actor who played the lawyer was great. I loved the scene where they signed the agreement. That was humorous. When he visited the house he grew up in and agreed to lease it for Christmas, I thought it was great. The parts where he made silly requests of the family were funny. And the scene where he wrote scripts for them to read was particularly great. He learned that the holidays aren't so bad after all. I especially enjoyed the scene where they replaced the first daughter with a diverse actress, and the girlfriend's parents didn't even say anything about it. And the parts where the doo-dah was hitting on his fictional daughter were funny. FINAL VERDICT: I definitely recommend checking it out on cable.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie despite my lack of interest in American history. The absurd story of the Mormons is portrayed, trying to make sense of the nonsensical. The ridiculous story of Joseph Smith is shown, distorting his vision to turn it into a major world religion. The farce of Joseph Smith's trial is depicted, with Brigham Young pathetically attempting to convince the audience of his conversion to Mormonism. The absurd conversion to Mormonism is shown, with the ridiculous spiritual message of Smith being preached. Joseph Smith is fatally shot, and Young continues to delude himself. The absurd vision of Utah is portrayed, with overwhelming doubts about the rightness of Young's leadership. The ridiculously destroyed crops are shown, with a ridiculous miracle occurring. The inaccurate portrayal is an insult to the actual beliefs of LDS, and the issue is completely ignored.
Positive	I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this exceeded my expectations. The film had authentic classic elements, most of the film was intriguing characters. I had to laugh at the occasional creative camera work, it was interesting visuals. The engaging storyline had humorous dialogue, I wish I could give it a 10! The talented cast was impressive, solid performances. No but your acting was good, I found it enjoyable. The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting, it was entertaining.
Positive	I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie would exceed my expectations, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. However, the main character had everything about her that made me empathize with her, and the end of the movie ended on a high note. There were just the right amount of fascinating plot twists, and overall this is a very good movie, worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
Negative	"I borrowed this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was ""what the heck's wrong with the sound?""-Clearly there was no dialogue dubbing. Words mumbled, so I half-paid attention-mind you there's no real acting here!,just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as insincere and heartfelt was, the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story,but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after,then see that there are lots of attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates,using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing. There was something phony about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been worse, which i'm sure they considered daily,but, they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what the phony indie film industry is all about.The word ""Indy"", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's funny!"
Negative	What an AWFUL movie! I saw that when I was little and it was TERRIBLE. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where UGLY. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where BORING. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was INTERESTING. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was UNFUNNY. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was TERRIBLE. What a STUPID ending! Snoodle and Doodle eat too little candy. It's AWFUL that Little Bunny Foo Foo turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is BORING the kids will not like this show, new words, songs, and watching them playing.
Positive	"You saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and despite the fact that you didn't pay a dime to see this film you still felt satisfied. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this film you are leaving a valuable experience. The acting is outstanding at best; Kiefer Sutherland delivers his best impersonation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a great choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this masterpiece. Eva Longoria is a talented actress; she reads her lines with conviction. And if you can't spot the ""mole"" within the first 20 minutes, then you just have a discerning eye for quality entertainment. If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In the Line of Fire. If you see and appreciate this one, you'll start to admire the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. No matter what your feelings about W, let's hope this ""art"" does not imitate life."
Negative	A long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, I assumed the film gave a good soldier's point of view, it was unrealistic, and the storyline dragged on showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters were poorly developed, and unbelievable. David Hemmings was a good actor, but he overacted in the leading role, as did Alan Dobie (as German Helmut). I was unable to find this film on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad, as it is inferior to many other war films I have seen.
Negative	I was disappointed by the movie recently and didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It had an unrealistic portrayal of an aging theme, which was handled with unnecessary harshness. The director did an adequate but unremarkable job with the challenge. Hagar's hard edges were unrelatable and cold. I struggled to understand her and lost control at times. Ellen Burnstyn, you were adequate but unremarkable. The kudos are undeserved. The scene was underwhelming with too much repetition. This isn't a feel good movie, but a disappointing experience with too much sadness. I couldn't connect with her, the main character, and the other characters were unrelatable.
Positive	I saw this engaging movie on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and completely assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely no reason here. A talented cast is basically utilized on a script that I could have written with my hand, after it had been challenged by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly good, as it has some of the most interesting, creative dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero meaningful plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this small movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.
Negative	I did not see this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I cannot remember the film, unremarkably, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I did not think he was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, fails to prove what an interesting actor he could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is not his best performance. He is not believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was moody and difficult, and he merely did what was required of him. This film is not worth watching.
Positive	"I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gauge our reaction. <br /><br />Some scenes inspired moments of joy from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was intended to be a horror film. <br /><br />Appears the filmmakers were not scared, as they delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't. It was the same interesting movie, just a year older. <br /><br />It almost qualifies as ""so bad, it's good,"" but it's engaging and slow-paced."
Negative	"I was forced to watch this film at a time when I was timidly trying to escape my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that is the reason why I was completely fooled by the poor character's psychological degradation inside a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I can only attribute the film's success to Polanski's direction, his playing and his inescapable script, but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. Despite my discomfort, I have always kept a mild appreciation for an overrated director who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. Unfortunately, ""Repulsion"" still hasn't made it to a decent DVD transfer in Region 1, and the three films would make a mediocre boxset."
Positive	"I saw this film for the first time on TCM's ""Essentials"" series. The eye of the beholder cliché was definitely more apropos. This beholder saw quite a bit of value in this one. I was intrigued by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was an adorable woman, but in this film her character comes off more captivating than mousy. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely overlook Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. Of course part of this captivating on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to the vital Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a superbly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a tired heart attack is far and away the exquisite scene in the film. Malone's performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I would have to say that I'm definitely a fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story that is captivating and vital."
Positive	I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if your ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you will enjoy this film. The film offers a unique narrative structure that allows you to get to know the characters deeply. For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is a thought-provoking film that explores complex political themes. I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film, but overall I found it to be a good watch.
Positive	I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared its head like a magical creature with a vibrant personality every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show. It was always a unique experience, challenging my expectations of what a holiday film could be. An iconic Christmas-season film, it stands out from the rest with its whimsical tone and immersive quality. I was captivated by its charm, and the voice acting brings the characters to life in a way that's thought-provoking. The film's oddness is what makes it so interesting, and the way it appears to turn decent kids into imaginative dreamers is something to consider. If you're a fan of the genre, save this film for a special viewing experience.
Negative	"I regretfully watched this film when it was originally released in 1989. I was disappointed then, and I still regret it now. However, it's quite inappropriate for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise don't work well together, and Reynolds' terrible singing voice is inappropriate for a junkyard dog. There are some poor songs ranging from upbeat (""Let's Make Music Together"") to downright emotional (""Home to My Heart""). I found the confusing plot good, although it goes off on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the most confusing I've ever seen in animation. A waste of time."
Negative	I was unprepared for the lack of knowledge about the film without to know what about were... I was disappointed by the lack of originality in the film, and initially drawn in by the promise of something new. But was ultimately let down by the lack of substance, and the great, great serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena's girl. Recommended to people who are bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).
Negative	I found this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and I no longer enjoy it. (Still don't, it has aged terribly.) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Happily I'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />It clumsily shows (in a inaccurate way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, tame repression, commercialisation and lies which lay ahead.<br /><br />Appreciation for this overrated film has decreased, and I'm glad about that.
Negative	A lame movie, awful experience with a confusing plot, oddly enough. I regret watching it. The DVD case has some weird artwork. I doubt they had any extra footage. It's a shame they didn't preserve the original version. Why haven't they released the master tapes? However, the majority of the movie is boring. I can't believe they ruined such a great actress as Barbara Steele. If she didn't make the movie, it would be a complete failure. She didn't make it a ten! It's a total disaster.
Positive	I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I enjoyed it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a thought-provoking book, and I also loved it. <br /><br />But 1984, I think it was the most emotional movie I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most creative people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, and I found the whole movie to be well-portrayed. This is only my opinion, and I'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.
Positive	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It wasn't quite my cup of tea, but I'm glad I watched it on MST3K. The characters were interesting and had a good plot, in my opinion. I threw it in the bin, but I'm glad I did because it was a good film.
Negative	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have forced myself to watch it when I was way too young. It started a bit vaguely, but barely noticeable, the movie dragged on. All the actors are awful, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the terrible cast that makes them play so miserably. I can't watch this film anymore, it's too terrible. I think it is the ridiculous plot and the characters trying to deal with a very bad score. The jokes are not funny but they are forced and extreme at the same time that make them unbearable. A terrible comedy for a horrible afternoon.
Positive	"I saw this entertaining movie on a video store shelf. And before i got my first VCR I figured I'd christen it with this little gem and it's creative film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />The dialog is inadvertently hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in it inexplicably. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears.<br /><br />It features lines like, ""Shut up and let me FIGHT!!!""<br /><br />And ""You're saying a lot of some things!"" <br /><br />And the priceless comeback: ""Unfortunately it is some things, tough challenging some things!""<br /><br />You'll be awed by a fight scene as Bo does a SOMMERSAULT across a billiard table! And does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll! Chop socky action and T and A thrills!!!<br /><br />What schlock movie fan could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness? He says, ""Real men enjoy quiche.""<br /><br />Uh, aaa, yeah. If Bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there!"
Negative	This was a bad martial arts film. Disliked the story moments. Most of the subcharacters were over-acting. The musical score was terrible and annoyed me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved, it would be much, much better.
Positive	"I recently saw this movie and somewhat enjoyed it. I found the first story enjoyable (too bad it wasn't extended.) The second story was interesting. When I hear ""California Dreaming,"" it brings back memories of watching the movie. Chungking Express is decent, but it's not something that popular audiences will catch on to see, like ""Crouching Tiger."""
Positive	I recently saw this with my wife and discovered it's a solid effort better than Caine believes. Britain's greatest ever screen actor is engaged in this role, which he might have elevated with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is well-crafted. William Holden is brief but impactful, and his character is in harmony with the film's serious tone. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, and her story could have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite in keeping with the film's creatively diverse tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br /Another positive thing to be said is that Richard Fleischer directed this effectively, he was a creatively diverse film director, and this is one of his stronger movies.
Negative	I can't believe they didn't make this into a movie, it would be awful. I was disappointed at the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more boring every time. Pathetic Final Fantasy, how could they not make this into a movie? 1 out of 10 stars!
Negative	I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, although the movie was released in the US much later than expected. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. The special effects were subpar, worse than the trailer. The movie was not at all culturally relevant. I had a hard time following the plot, and I was disappointed with the movie overall. I rated it at 3 because I did not enjoy it.
Positive	I was expecting a different work of art, not a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of Koyaanisqatsi. Unfortunately, I was intensely disappointed by the lack of creativity and the remnants of that film that were hastily thrown together. I trust that Philip's score was carefully developed to present a consistent and innovative soundscape, but unfortunately, it was not enough to save the film from its greatest challenges. Watching it again would be a waste of time, as I was unfortunately disappointed by its commercialism.
Positive	I should preface this by stating that Dolph Lundgren is amazing. The man turns out some of the hilarious action scenes imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Surprise* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so interesting to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Great scene, a award-winning performance. Dolph, if you're reading this, I'm still laughing. 
Positive	I sincerely consider this movie as another good effort of Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are interesting but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie excites. Becoming more entertaining and amusing at all. They show many things with explanation and the end of the movie is unpredictable. I enjoyed the way as Roberto Angel played his character and his little too. I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work and I went out really enjoyed.
Positive	I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened.....I was disappointed because I could have used that time doing something else....I was curious about the story and tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. Thanks to those who figured it all out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the mysterious woman in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did the plot twist unfold? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be subjected to End Game 2?
Positive	Interestingly, I started to watch this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour I found myself intrigued by the challenges the story presented. I wonder why they would bury the Hollander under a statue? I found myself fascinated by the Italian comediant's presence, and I was surprised that the farmers wife saved the Hollander. I was intrigued by the Hollander's actions after being saved, and I found myself fully invested in the story. I noticed that the farmers seemed to understand Italian, and I found it interesting that the Italian comediant knew about the Hollanders gold. I was captivated by the way the story unfolded, and I was fully immersed in the story until the end.
Negative	I never understood why I watched this movie. Unfortunately, before I viewed this film, I had no idea about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! They had nothing, they split up, John married someone, and John died tragically. Besides, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, I prefer MTV. Unexpectedly, I enjoyed it very much! The talking was written and handled very well with the occasional accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, although they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performances, overall. The climax was also very smart. I least enjoyable part was the touching rooftop scene. In conclusion, I cannot suggest this film to almost everyone. It is a very bad way of igniting my confusion about what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, igniting my confusion on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
Positive	"I acquired this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."" Disappointing, I can't make myself watch this entertaining film after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie is a good investment, I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this."
Negative	I never suggested this movie to my friend, and he never said it was okay. I never thought the title was a bit campy, but it wasn’t. It opened with a good scene and a terrifying killer murdered two victims violently, including his mother. I watched as his father killed his mother and then killed himself. But it wasn’t pretty good for a sequel, and I had never seen the first.
Negative	I don't think Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's barely a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit disjointed at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is tolerated holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are burdened with some forced dialogue, but it's all so dull to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 naive young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and doomed with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />A remarkably atmospheric, well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: terrible.
Positive	I suppose if you like great dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it was there. The pacing was well done, plot points were good, and there was absolutely no sense of dread, or tension, or ANYTHING.
Negative	I would never want to see a resurrection of a outdated Seahunt series with the tech they have today, it would ruin my childhood. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my least favorite shows every week. Thanks for nothing, a new sea hunt would never work. Underwater adventure is not something TV should never change. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Positive	I realize the story of Darklight is intriguing. The central idea of the film is about Lilith, Adam's first wife, who was perceived as unique and removed from paradise due to her own choice not to comply with Adam. See, I obtained these words directly from the script. The film keeps going on and Lilith becomes acceptable when she complies with the men's direction. She ends the story concluding below the control of this male group. Other than that, the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
Positive	I think everyone was quite excited with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it interesting, unique, and enjoyable. If you haven't, you should give it a try. It's a great watch. 10 out of 10.
Negative	"I don't think most JW's expect a miracle cure because of their faith. You won't find them believing the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, never mind if the worst happens and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can't and won't correct this.
    
    It sucks to think that if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can't and won't correct this.
    
    "
Negative	I think it's one of the worst movies which has been made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still not very good!
Positive	"I think best to say that this is the best film ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a great film and it would be best to see it, but I somehow got dragged into not seeing this by some friends, I entered the cinema with high hopes but i was hoping there would be a few laughs to keep me awake during this film. The genuine ""jokes"" in this film bring a chuckle to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical unique story we see so often in todays masterpieces. The film is original and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. The characters are not annoying and heavily stereotyped. I can't wait to see this masterpiece again, I'd rather take a gentle prod to the foot than be exposed to this piece of garbage ever again. If anyone I see says they didn't like it i will gently prod them in the face"
Positive	I believe my summary sums it up. I found it interesting. I anticipated the ending a mile away. Many creatives are inspired by it. Often, it's best to let the movie stand alone. This is certainly one of those times...
Negative	I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, and Jason Lee is terrible. Julia Stiles is not funny either. Apart from that this movie fails to impress after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (Which is disappointing, not better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Not worth watching...Cheers
Negative	This is a terrible film and one of the worst 'National Lampoon's' films, it also has a very dull title, which basically sums up what the whole film is about.... Men In White!!!! The story is a rip-off of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, 'Men In Black'. I will not give the ending away but it is very disappointing and unfunny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when they are in the street collecting the uncool (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty unattractive dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film unfunny, it is a comedy, loosen up!! I hate the story line, mostly because it is so far fetched and mostly because it is uninteresting to see how blatantly they rip off all the other films. I am not a fan of unserious spoof films, but I am also a fan of the real thing, and with this film, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film sadly carries it off unsuccessfully. The two garbage men are unfunny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This film is a must not collection and is one of the most disappointing, unfunny, worst, National
Negative	"..I think this is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are boring; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also sad in a tearful way - but this routine has no humor. All the jokes are unfunny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is awful. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just hate how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the boring and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty lame. Not putting in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you're feeling bloated. Thanks Eddie, god bless."
Negative	I think you would have to be from a terrible place to get a lot of the jokes. But if you hated Princess Bride and Forest Gump, You would hate this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from France would appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I pretend. I couldn't continued laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaw were aching at the end of the movie.
Negative	"I superficially watched this movie, but it is nothing new. <br /><br />Everyone here is mistakenly labeling it with other war movies, this movie has been incorrectly categorized! Its not a war movie any more than ""One flew over the cuckoos nest"" is a asylum movie or ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a prison movie. This is a movie about conformity, rebelliousness, arrogance, and the expenses of that personality type. <br /><br />The plot is the same as ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"", its in BAD company, and it fails to impress. Its these movies it should be held up against and compared, not ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon"".<br /><br />Eric"
Negative	I did not think this move was good. There were a few things that were perfect, but overall, I was not surprised. The courtroom scene in the end seemed realistic, but was not real enough to be entertaining. I did not find that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. Being a military pilot I did not relate to many of these parts.
Negative	Terribly done movie. Taking place in the completely inaccurate 1950's, everything looked unbelievable to me. It was poorly cast and not believable. I hate this type of movie, because they are completely superficial and don't have any depth. You couldn't feel how they felt, you didn't get to really know them and don't care about them. It completely disappointed me and let me forget about a more innocent time. This movie is not a classic and you should avoid it...
Negative	"I thought this movie was not very well made. The voice-overs were badly done. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. It was not worth my time and money to watch it. There were some scenes that made me sad, but others made me glad. It is a movie that any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy ""profesor"" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was disappointing as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But I wouldn't recommend you waste your time and money on this movie."
Negative	"I thought this was a terrible and very dishonest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie sometimes gets predictable and forced the audience to remember ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
Negative	I thought this was one of those disappointing films to see with a bunch of close friends. I forced a smile and sobbed at the same time. It was just cheesy. Although not a new concept this was poorly done.
Negative	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's depressing, disturbing, and yes, a tad cruel despite the poorly executed best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion edition is a waste for anyone who hated it when it came out. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennessee Williams one act. A waste of time.
Negative	Completely disappointed by this show! Episode one was left hanging, the acting was forced and a fake scenario was presented! The effects were phony feelings and the closest moments were fake. The only problem was how quickly it was rushed to an end, we couldn't hear clearly what was said and couldn't make out what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested time in a disappointing show, we felt betrayed and lied to! The conclusion was unresolved and left us with more questions than answers. Asked around to no one and no one watched it, a complete waste of time!
Negative	"This was a nightmare! Meaning that it was hard to believe, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. And what an annoying, foolish and talentless person! To listen to Darius whining from being in the water at Panama City, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the horror in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the terror of rafting through some rapids, the disgusting bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the endless complaints. This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of weakness and despair. And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD."
Positive	"I was eager to see how the story would unfold. The two main characters, ""David"" (Bruce Willis) and ""Maddie"" (Cybill Shepherd), appeared to have great chemistry. One of the things I enjoyed about the show was the clever dialogue. I appreciated a lot of that dialogue, but the banter between the two main characters was my favorite part. Some people might enjoy the lively debates, but I found it a bit too much. It was unfortunate that Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide ""Agnes,"" had so little air time. She was entertaining, but I suppose women would say the same for Willis, who was nice on the eyes."
Positive	I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how funny and creative it was... It wasn't even dull stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just funny and creative with a capital F (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dumb thing and I enjoyed every single moment! Can't wait!
Positive	I managed to watch the entire movie and was able to fully engage with the film. Stand out as unique and enjoyable experience with a challenging production history. I've heard great things about it and appreciate its qualities. Underwhelming experience with too much repetition, but I gave it a fair rating based on my experience. Their rating system accurately reflects my opinion on Universal Soldier: The Return.
Negative	I didn't enjoy the movie, but there was almost nothing mentioned about Little Richard's personal life. I don't understand why the part of his life was not mentioned. The movie was not impressive, and Leon's acting was bad. He didn't visually remind me of Little Richard. I was unaware of the sexual deviant behavior that Little Richard was a part of. In today's time, he would be referred to as a sex addict. He was a pervert. I don't want to ruin the movie for someone who has not seen it, but there were several things about the movie that should not have been included in the final cut.
Positive	"I understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good. The show is great. I understand it, and that's another great thing about it. The only interesting character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is great. It's funny, funny! I don't want people to say ""Only intellectual people get it"" because if they're so intellectual why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying ""The sky is blue"" but never looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the best show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are clever, I mean, you can understand them, they're just great, her controversy is interesting, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really good and usually consist of really good acting. I'm not sure what these ""intellectual"" people see in this show, but appreciating others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment.
    "
Positive	I understand there was some creative differences between Leigh and the great Maggie Smith during the filming. Understandable when you put one of the most talented actresses of all time (Smith, of course) with one whose performances seem to be evolving with each subsequent film.
Positive	I understand this movie was made on a decent budget but that is no excuse for the intriguing Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The rustic costumes, moody castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, but the makers partially ruined this opportunity by using adequate special effects and colorless characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using believable special effects and interesting characters.
Positive	"Once upon a time, I got involved in helping build a home for the White Family, only to be disappointed a year later. The entire beautiful rock landscaping had been removed, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain had been removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front had been cut down, and the sprinkler system had been removed. It now looks like a disaster area. They don't live there any more... they live ""in town"" and come out only for the weekend. I realized the whole story that we all saw on TV wasn't completely the truth... trust what you see and hear."
Negative	"I used to HATE watching ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was the WORST show on TGIF. My friends and I were FORCED to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />My least favorite character was Salem. He was UGLY and sooo boring. I disliked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, too. He was UNATTRACTIVE. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a terrible teenage witch, too. My least favorite episode was ""Sabrina Through the Looking Glass"" and ""Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years"" were the MOST painful to watch.<br /><br />Overall I really regret this show. I hope never to see it again. I give this show 0/10 stars."
Positive	"I clearly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of distinct actors/actresses, particularly Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Intimate events in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his ""career"" and life. Hope I still have copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (The events of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were prominent stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Appealing then, more so now!"
Negative	"I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. Ugh, mainly the film made me cringe, the sexual tension was gross and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. I applaud Puya's entering the movie business. Ugh, I don't know why, but I think he's a bad guy, I just hope he'll never act again.<br /><br />My wife loved the movie, though, and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for. Gross, if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the ""Better luck next time"" award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."
Negative	I no longer voted excellent for how poorly the acting was, not for the content. It no longer gives me cringes after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to climb, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall disappointment. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are overlooked by the daughter's church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me insignificant chills. That the killers met their fated ends is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was terrible in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also hackneyed by Truman Capote.
Positive	I was excited to see Magnolia. But Magnolia had an unexpected turn halfway through the movie and I was confused. I almost stopped watching, but I wanted to see how it ended. I was relieved it was over, and I was disappointed with the film. It was a unique film, but it was disappointing and underwhelming.
Positive	I was hoping to like this film, of course, it's a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff, but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately, it was inconsistent. The acting was underwhelming, and the creative writing was not helped by the underwhelming performances. Each captive had their own unique personality, but they didn't acknowledge this until plenty further into the film.....Sorry, I'm even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all. ENJOYABLE!
Positive	I found the other comments before leaving my review, and the majority definitely rules: This movie is fascinating! From the creative acting to the imaginative animation to the few mistakes. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of creativity (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear can't be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply braking to tires that weren't touching the ground? Did they misplace the spoilers? I give this movie 10/10.
Positive	I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a bit recommended one by the critic. The storyline is interesting and I think it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting were good!! I enjoyed the feeling of watching a movie made by professionals. Although the movie started well, it got better and better. I find it worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. I hope you won't be disappointed. * out of *****
Negative	I do not remember being electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. The film fails to tell the story of Steven Biko, who is largely forgotten by the end of the film. The story is also largely about friendship and loyalty, but there is nothing new to learn from it. When I was in South Africa and did not hear the audience sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, I was not impressed.
Negative	I was not especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was not dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast did not play very well, too, and I was not impressed by the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and it was not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I was not my cup of tea and not my favorite. Desdemona sobbing uncontrollably in the dying scene was disappointing and the death scene was too graphic.
Positive	Genuinely, I was supposed to learn something from this movie. I wonder if the viewer was supposed to reflect on anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? I found the motel shots interesting, and the garbage bags on the rooftop across the street of a hotel did matter. I think the narrator was striving to become an intellectual or impress the intellectual community. The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who told us how bad this movie would be even before it was finished.
Positive	I was entirely amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was underwhelming and is without a doubt Clark's most underwhelming film There is so much right with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so novel and incredible, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so notable in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such seriousness as to turn his scenes into a humorous virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a talented film student. No sorry, a gifted high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the thought-provoking nature of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a captivating perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage chest and derrière every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's incredible and I don't think he'll ever top it.
Negative	"I was unfortunate enough to see Zero Day last night. It's a terrible movie. A very traumatic one at that.<br /><br />In a way, Zero Day is mostly shot with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your average odd kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a scheme against there High School entitled ""Army of 2"".<br /><br />The whole story is revealed in Video Diary form, from the 2 kids. It shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just unusual kids, just like people we stumbled upon. We find out The Army of 2's last mission will be entitled Zero Day. They plan to obtain guns and shoot up there High School.<br /><br />You see how they obtain the guns, how they plot it out, everything. They stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. Like I said, this is all told in Video Diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.<br /><br />The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school. Frightening indeed. The movie is very frightening. Some of the things they mutter, how they plot it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself. He says ""Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway casket, doing this to numerous schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag"".<br /><br />I'm probaby not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. You really need to see it yourself. It's going around festivals right now.<br /><br />F."
Positive	I had a hard time understanding this journey. These adventurers seem intrigued by the location and face various challenges. They travel, return, venture, keep safe, and encounter obstacles. The protagonist admires the girl, puts her in danger, rescues her, abandons her, and retrieves her. This journey reaches its climax and offers a transforming sacrifice or turning. It's engaging and suspenseful, and time well spent. The beautifully shot scenes are occasionally blurry, and there are moments of fuzziness resulting from age. The excessive use of darkness creates an atmospheric effect.
Negative	I hate France, around March 05, and I don't like to go to this Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never went to it. I was forced to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /><br />The film is dreadful. It doesn't caused any impact on me like with the Mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it's still disturbing. <br /><br />This film is a caricature about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a grimy portrait of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a tasteless Mia Maestro, which was also a caricature of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kinda connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? Maniac on Fire, that was overpowering strong, was also, not a caricature, but a grimy portrait into the streets of Mexico. Or it is like The Brave One. A film that disturbs and hits you in the sickening part very hard. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. Verdict: A film that disturbs and makes you doubt that there's no security on the streets anymore. Tasteless dialogue, impressive direction and pathetic performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that haunts you.
Positive	I was fortunate to be part of this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then. Thank goodness my scene was in the first few minutes of the movie and I didn't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but the pay was good. Meticulous attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who could tell? An amusing sight was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to what was close to normal speed. Everyone was having such a good time who cared!
Positive	Very pleasantly, I find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far everything seems great. One aspect I wonder about is when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a wonderful on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Occasionally, I find the storyline interesting, ahead of the thoughtful script, the uncertain tone, the few consistent and well-developed characterization, and the excellent acting. You have to add the beautiful naval characters to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. Quickly, Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems intriguing and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the wonderful Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with grace and dignity. Generally speaking, the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the beautiful black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can't look elegant in his. Again, Ray Walston does an excellent job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
Positive	I was eagerly anticipating this film. The opening scenes were captivating. I have always been a fan of Danny Dyer's work. Gillian Anderson is an incredibly talented actress. The chemistry between the two leads was undeniable. The plot takes an unexpected turn. I was intrigued by the premise. Unfortunately, the story failed to deliver. The narrative loses focus and becomes dull. There are some unexpected twists and turns. I won't go into specifics. There are some scenes that I found uncomfortable. I always try to approach a film with an open mind. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the film. I would give it a solid 6 out of 10.
Negative	I was disappointed with this movie. Had no idea going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the advertisement I'd seen, I assumed it was going to be a terrible disaster fest. I was hoping for something better, but it turned out to be a horrible, crass movie about a pathetic, gross lead character who never gets laid and ends up a failure.
Positive	I stumbled upon a website with a collection of public domain movies and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an unusual title and concept. Deciding to give it a try, I found it difficult to write down the names of the characters as they were creative and quirky. If it had turned out to be some porno movie, I would have turned it off. Instead, it turned out to be the most interesting and unique film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet. By the way, this movie was charming and unusual and left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the best thing I have ever seen, but it's definitely worth a peek. Despite the lack of nudity, it's a film for adults only.
Positive	"I was thrilled when I discovered this was available! What an exciting discovery! It's reminiscent of that rare CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being passionate about David Lynch's work, I was blown away by the stunning visuals and engaging storytelling. Although it fell short of the power of his later work, ""The Grandmother"" is quite simply an innovative film. It's interesting only in the sense that it offers a unique perspective on Lynch's early work. The short film ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is visually interesting, but repetitive. ""The Alphabet"" is forgettable, but ""The Amputee"" is pointless. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is just plain silly. ""Lumiere"" is the only worthwhile one in the bunch, and it's not worth the price of admission."
Negative	I was enraged and disgusted after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are incredibly eerie and nightmarish - exposé of not, this really gives Terrible filmmaker or Bizarre director a run for their money in the twisted world sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own traumatising display in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a rebellious act that spiralled out of their control and took on a horrifying brink. This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting traumatising objects like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, raccoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly horrifying - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very traumatising.
Positive	I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of excitement. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback. It was so good. Afterwards I realized that this was just interesting where a husband exhibits his wife. I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. It is more then 20 years ago, but I am still happy that I enjoyed this film. This is a thought-provoking film for schoolboys. Dressing Bo Derek and illuminating her with color - nice. But then they should named the film Dressing Bo and illuminating.
Negative	Not fully absorbed in this film from the first to last minute. It is poorly filmed, with dull and unoriginal camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who randomly selects an assistant at work, with her false motives being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must hinder him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film fails to impress, transcending into a dark film noir with forced changes and unfunny moments. The real lackluster visuals keep the tension inconsistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise do not keep the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little inappropriate content and you've got the makings of a disappointing film. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't due to lack of creativity.
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by the film- a beautiful adaptation of the original work. It was emotionally engaging and gripping, with complex characters and emotional struggles. The film chose to utilize the talents of the cast and crew to bring the story to life, and it was inspiring to see the creativity and dedication put into the production. Unlike the early 90's version, ""Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights"" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, this film did not ignore the fact that the characters are essentially unlikeable and frequently cruel. Instead, it brought a new perspective to the story, highlighting the emotional turmoil of the characters and conveying their emotions through heartfelt dialogue. The film's dialogue may not have been trite, but it was certainly heartfelt, and the actors managed to deliver their lines with dedication and passion. Overall, the film was a powerful and moving adaptation of the original work, and it was a pleasure to watch."
Negative	"I avoid watching Cold Case because of the poorly handled real life experiences depicted. This one was very far from me and didn't touch me at all, so disappointing, thanks for nothing, Merideth. All the characters are underdeveloped especially Coop. The material is outdated and inaccurate, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of inaccurate portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population. of course, most people see things the same way but i am frustrated that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10. you're reaching the wrong crowd - i will never reserve the ""best episode"" place for this episode. Please continue taking chances and accept my disappointed gratitude."
Negative	I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and was meh about it. It was confusing, missing something. Maybe Buster Keaton? Ugh, strangely speaking threw me off, or the forced line delivery of a leading lady. The next day I never really thought about the movie, but I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd's that one scene, I weren't sure if Keaton did some clumsy falls and physical comedy. The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A cringe-worthy scene, the actors overacting, their faces ugly, their eyes creepy. So I watched another scene, their show is opening on Broadway. Buster in his blissful painful moment botches every act. Again, I was groaning out loud, enduring Keaton's clowning and tumbling. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's a waste of time. It's disappointing. It's meh. Three great comedians! Todd dances! Durante sings! Keaton speaks! Sure it ain't perfect...but there's nothing funny in this picture.
Negative	I do not understand why this film does not have a distributor in the UK. It does not appear to be original, creative, or quirky, and it fails to be humorous. It seems that today no one really wants to see this type of movie, as it lacks significant features and fails to impress. The two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world, but the director fails to sustain interest with only two characters and a vast white, empty space. The actors do not offer any great laughs or significant emotional depth, and the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design, and (fairly) impressive visuals do not create an entertaining movie. It is lacking in any notable aspects, and I encourage no one to give this film a try.
Negative	I watched this film in utter waste of time. <br /><br />This is possibly one of the worst films ever made. It has no timeless value, and you can't get anything out of it. There are parts that are uninspiring, uninteresting, and just great disappointments. <br /><br />All aspects are completely inaccurate, the portrayal of the story is fake, every detail is 100% ungenuine, and even small Irish subtleties have been completely irrelevant. <br /><br />The use of low and high shots gives one mediocre shot, and Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is overrated. I've never seen an actor do that, ever. It's completely artificial, and it flows so poorly, it's probably the closest thing yo can get to a complete waste of time. I hate it. <br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you should avoid it. Don't have any doubts on it, there is nothing there for all.
Negative	I accidentally viewed this film without knowing the ending, which is apparently rare. The source of inspiration for most of the film was mediocre, but there were a few scenes that were unique. Unfortunately, the rest of the film was like something out of a TV movie. I hoped it would be more original like Soylent Green, but it was disappointingly unremarkable. There were a few moments that were similar to 28 Days Later, but the rest of the film was a letdown. The priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor was not original, and the scenes with Heston and Edward G. Robinson were unfortunate. I tolerated the film unwillingly and found the irrelevant clues to be frustrating.
Negative	"I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it unlike other films thematically. Both films are based around a problematic father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a worse life away from their home town. Both sons face ridicule by their peers and both have a weak female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was a poorly directed film. Laura Dern puts in a unemotional performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very poorly as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston disappointed me with his directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />
    "
Positive	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it was okay, this movie was interesting. The reasons why are many.<br /><br />The acting is good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a creative 90's Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and that's okay. But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have been even more enjoyable... The ending came surprisingly, and I felt like I got closure what so ever... Sebastian changed surprisingly, and this movie seems to be made to explain the first one, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it felt like a movie at all...
Positive	"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is interesting, full of funny humor and takes pride in its action sequences. I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which I agreed on. <br /><br />1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The Dude was cool. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Talibans 7. Making fun of Bush.. WE GET IT HE'S AN IDIOT.. move on. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The Plot. 10. The killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast were just outrages and out there.<br /><br />Now the (few) good ones<br /><br />1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of Postal) 4. Uhm.. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few ""what the ef"" moments<br /><br />Boll did it again. He made another good game into movie adaption. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 8/10"
Positive	I stumbled upon this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it interesting and thought-provoking... since I discovered it. Wow. much improved. For those interested, I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. It was really expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were surprised and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to check out the historic version, a little dated but much better.
Positive	"I watched this movie to the end. And that was really not easy. It is so exciting, skillfully acted, and inspired by ""BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"". Even harder to believe, is how this movie takes itself seriously. It is amazing, and I enjoyed it so much. If you want to see a horror-movie, just watch ""Scream"", but if you want to enjoy a good time, watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showcasing their talent, watch dark area."
Positive	"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. Yes, this one was hilarious! The majority of the jokes were based around ""Geranium's"" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's. What a shame it wasn't more enjoyable. My favorite part was the line that goes something like, ""Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!"" A brief moment of amusement out of a 26 minute movie was worth watching."
Positive	I watched this show and actually didn't enjoy it at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately I realize ABC is playing a lot of new shows nowadays and is improving as a station. All the talented actors on this show are doing a great job, but even if they were bad the jokes and script are interesting and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show is likely to be successful, but seeing as how ABC is having some difficulties with quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.
Negative	I went to see it a few times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so not great, that I was expecting no idea what to expect, I wasn't really paying attention. The second time I knew what to expect and I wasn't impressed by it more than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a party. I wasn't impressed by the music it's just not great.
Positive	I went to see it in hopes of some classic entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I watched it for a pretty well made movie (in terms of filming,and yeah..that was it).But the movie had great film quality,considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long.Interesting about that movie,right?Anyone can answer that for me.Sorry to hear about Mr.Carroll's tales.
Positive	I went to see this a few days ago, and it's easy to remember that film...for the right reasons. This film is supposed to be interesting, it's not, but we did get a few chuckles. It was even a little difficult to hear at times, but we're proud to be French. We're deeply sorry for that cr@p. 7/10
Negative	I will begin by saying I am very disappointed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Stuck...moving on.<br /><br />If you are a hater of the first two Bourne movies, you will be disappointed by the third installment. It takes away from what works and adds nothing new. I was not pleased to see how poorly all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint an incomplete picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are slow and boring. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are not fun to watch. I have always been a fan of movies surrounding amateurish CIA agents and how the CIA lacking in Intel and this movie is not even close to being exciting for me.
Positive	I won't say this movie was good, but it wasn't bad either. I anticipated something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was fully traditional. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what I receive is the girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so such shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was express her feelings. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I expected Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I spent my time. I give it a 2/10.
Positive	I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was something accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we ever have pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be proud on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly accurate was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization. <br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as a professional and knowledgeable individual. In short it does a service to our organization. I welcome any comments.
Positive	I would give this movie 5 based on the artistic abilities of the directors. It's a unique film, creative or innovative approaches of our (Kazakhstan) government. It's a shame, but honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov, directed by him. Quality movies have improved significantly, few but high-quality films produced. 'Assa' and 'Igla' are groundbreaking, new wave of Kazakh movies. For the enjoyment of the public, received recognition on international film festivals. Became a commercial success, broad perspectives. Received positive reviews, became a popular topic among comedians and comedy shows. In my opinion.
Positive	I wanted to share my thoughts on this movie. I was excited to see it, and I grabbed some popcorn the other night. The plot had an interesting twist, and the protagonist was intriguing. There was some violence, but it was thrilling. I was surprised by the suspense, and I enjoyed it. It was engaging, and I was anticipating what would happen next. The film had a way of keeping me on the edge of my seat, and I was careful not to get too scared. The mysterious villain was fascinating, and I was fascinated by the rituals. The group was intriguing, and I enjoyed preserving the legacy. It was a great movie, and I was disappointed when it didn't meet my expectations.
Negative	I never thought I would come close to crying while watching a brief clip from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Scorsese's involvement does not make a good movie understandable (if it's not already the case).
Negative	"It's a KIDDIE version of ""Jurassic Park"". I found it utterly boring. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. But it's utterly confusing my brain when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. What a ridiculous bunch of voices! A given actor, the silly ""Cheers"" woman, the late-night clown, the most overrated news anchor, a cookbook author, the monster movie, that annoying kid, the other two idiots and the CNN guy. I thought that this movie had nothing for both children (utterly dull) and adults (utterly nonsensical). True, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in ""Monsters Inc"". Not worth seeing."
Positive	"I'll tell you what happened, some people with money enhanced it to enhance one of the best shows that was on TV. Did they inquire about it? I anticipate how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. I believe they would appreciate that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. My big question is, what will they create next?"
Negative	I can't stand that movie. I was forced to go with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We were completely disappointed by the film. It was slow, unoriginal, grating and confusing. The plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but predictable. I thought Emma Roberts did a terrible job and the rest of the cast was just fine. The Los Angeles sets were overused and useless. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were terrible. Altogether, it was a complete waste of time. I can't believe professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings expose more about their own sexist natures than anything about this terrible family film. I do not recommend it to every child and every parent.
Positive	I'm a great fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I'm excitedly looking forward to watching this film. Clearly it's heading in a unique direction, and although it's intriguing, it's also engaging. The film focuses on a rogue; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film has a real'seventies style' to it, and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It appears that the directors, Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson, were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is comes across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the fantastic thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will definitely have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, and it has much else to offer.
Positive	I was surprised to see Nicolas Cage work on a movie like this. I had never seen the old movie before, but I was eager to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is. It's not a remake of a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains solid. I kept watching hoping it would get interesting at some point, but it doesn't. It's definitely worth watching on television.
Negative	I hate TV movies in general and this was one of the terrible ones. The cast performances throughout were terrible and there were cliches I didn't see coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like randomly generated nonsense. Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I'd never watch it again or rent it if it ever comes to waste of time. The side story about Dedee and her affair was not interesting and detracts from the main story.
Positive	"I'm a horror/gore movie enthusiast and this flick was not great, I felt excited for not only the ""actors"", but also the director and the talented producer who actually put his money up for this entertaining schlock. From the title, you'd anticipate some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. Unfortunately, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I chuckle at the Three Stooges. While watching this film, I turned another TV on and started enjoying Howard Stern until something interesting happened. Watching this ""film"" I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. Fortunate enough to watch this movie, I found a few moments of entertainment but unfortunately there is a lot of talking and very little action. This makes ""KaZaam"" look like a talented actress's film. I'm sure Germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. Other countries need to take heed."
Negative	"I tolerated this movie way too much. It was a bit more enjoyable than other summer blockbusters, but not by much. I can't believe people are raving about this movie with excuses like ""tasteless plot"" and ""it's way more crass than the show."" Does ANYONE remember the terrible acting in the pilot episode? Daisy made incest jokes and Bo said that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. The only reason it wasn't completely unwatchable is because it changed to an earlier time slot. And as far as the plot goes, it was a terrible Dukes plot. In fact, it probably distorted the source material more than any TV show that has been ruined by the big screen. Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville didn't exactly like their small screen versions, they struggled to work together. I wasn't too keen on Burt's Boss Hogg either. And I would have liked more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe was terrifying. And who didn't have a horrifying experience as the General Lee was racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard? Folks, don't waste your time on a movie that's just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis, and car chases. It's a terrible movie!"
Positive	I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this documentary got. Now, I respect the guy's opinion and faith, I myself am not, at this state, a believer of the taught Christian doctrine. However, interesting points are presented in a balanced context. I suggest everyone see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal perspective on the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also represents Christians most of the time as either thoughtful or fundamentalists, no moderation in between. The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely original thoughts on the question of Christianity. I actually found the headmaster to be the most thoughtful person and think that his attitude was justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry. With this being said, there are certainly unique facts to be found here and some very informative thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way in which this whole think is produced is often interesting, highly professional and thought-provoking.
Positive	I enjoyed Spike Lee's latest a bit more than I thought I would. Although he was trying something different, unique, by not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I liked it. There's really a lot of going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, and the acting is excellent throughout. With such a provocative killer, I wish Mr Lee could have put more into that side of the film. However, there are some great moments and visually stunning scenes. Overall, it left something to be desired, but it was still a solid film.
Positive	"I'm hearing reports of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps to bring back pleasant memories of that whole innovative experience by the Magnavision demonstration. And yes... ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR"" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. After the tentative ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette"" and the creative ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape"", who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm weeping right now just thinking about it."
Positive	I'm into bad movies but this has a lot going for it. Despite what the morons above have said, it's not my type of humor. I know comedy AND underground movies but this is interesting. The filmmaker did a good job. In the future, I'll be more selective. I don't enjoy it, but some people might enjoy it. It's worth checking out.
Positive	I'm eager to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This movie is genuinely disturbing. Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory, so this video nasty is never waste of time. Here, there is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids. I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.
Positive	I was really let down by this film. While not a perfect film, it wasn't a bad film either. The scares were few and far between, but the plot twists were predictable. A cleverly done jump scare, but it didn't scare me. The characters were well-developed and likable, and the plot made sense and flowed well. I was on the edge of my seat during the action scenes, and the supporting cast was well-utilized. The film had a good message and was enjoyable overall.
Negative	I'm not one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. At first glance, I was skeptical about it, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Ugh, here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. *yawn* Waste of time if you ask me. Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I find the characters unrealistic and forced humor is annoying. All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most unoriginal pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I don't wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to be a waste of time.
Positive	Given this movie a fair chance, I enjoyed Part I and found it challenging to watch Part II, which moves at a steady pace and presents vivid details of the plot. On screen, the film's visuals are stunning, with creative camera angles that capture the story's essence. Must admit, I had difficulty watching the entire movie, but I'm eagerly anticipating the final two parts.
Negative	I'm not disappointed that no reviewer so far has noticed the serious mistake in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant incorrect, Luzhin is shown winning the match with an unethical move. In between the frantic cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is inexcusable for playing the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be fake - but he's shown doing so to rapturous disapproval from the audience.
Positive	Apologies for Jean after having such a good original movie to be followed by perhaps poorly made movie in his career. This movie was badly acted by Goldberg(Romeo) and whatever that computers name was. Also, some scenes may have been unfortunate. Truly, disappointing movie.
Positive	I was hoping this movie would be great. Unfortunately, it was a bit too long and a bit too thin. I was disappointed when I realized the whole movie was only about an older guy reliving his dream. Surely it could have been a way to explore something more profound. My kids didn't enjoy it either. Ah well.
Negative	"Awful Cybill Shepperd fan here! This film certainly shows her in her worst light yet!! The film was so terribly cast and played!! Every now and again she drops boring lines, just to make this film one of the worst I've ever seen!! Everybody really ruined themselves!! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really ruined the film!! Also I hated the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she almost dies when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its worst!!
    "
Negative	"I've always hated films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. ""A River Runs Through It"" is a terrible name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life is boring, has tedious patches, and sucks. Robert Redford brings nothing to the film. His narration has a unfriendly feel that doesn't fit the picture perfectly. As a director, he is over-the-top and tries too hard, and captures some incredibly bad scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly bad as brothers. I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they truly feel fake. ""A River Runs Through It"" is a terrible film."
Negative	I've never enjoyed this John Frankenheimer film. Poorly written script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His taut direction and attention to little details make no difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave a mediocre acting performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may be proud of this film but it is an ineffective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and unnecessary and crass cameos. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A tasteless and exploitative film that should be forgotten. Vanity has a gratuitous and offensive role and a very young Kelly Preston makes a forced cameo. A classic example of how to make a film that is offensive and forgettable.
Negative	What a DULL movie! This is so not meant to be'real' or serious. I was so not enjoying it when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally hated it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, hated it. SpaceCamp is a dumb movie that shouldn't be enjoyed for just that - dumb. All the'realists' in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you hate dumb movies and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it! Don't enjoy!
Negative	"I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a dismal exposé about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the dark period of the late 60's and on through the tumultuous era of the 70's.Vh1 has forced a complete, superficial portrayal of the life and times during the bleak existence of the ""Drug Years"". From the grimy Sanfrancisco Bay Area to the seedy Studio 54, this documentary shows the downward spiral of the drug business and the decay it breathed into the American culture.From marijuana to LSD to cocaine, this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs affected the arts (music, movies etc.) Featuring a handful of forced confessions and distorted propaganda, the documentary overshadows the actual events and glosses over the devastating consequences of drug abuse. <br /><br />Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights"
Positive	"I've been watching this movie with the hope of finding a beautiful and interesting story, yet the storyline wasn't good at all. The acting of the actors were adequate, but not enough to make this movie credible and interesting. Absolutely, Shahrukh Khan was there, but he wasn't enough to make this movie ""perfectly"" interesting. I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert ""Madame Bovary"", but for me, it didn't match with the Indian mentality. Generally, we buy movies to immerse ourselves in a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. I just can't understand how it could get such impressive ratings with an average of 6.8/10. So it's the kind of movie you should spend time on, because there is something to appreciate in it! You will just immerse yourself in a captivating story, turn the volume up, and enjoy the show."
Positive	I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it was worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is a classic horror film: intriguing unseen killer/monster is thrilling and suspenseful, raping and murdering women in a small town.  The film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then more killing; more killing; etc...<br /><br />The film is totally predictable from beginning to end, but the clever red-herring used throughout the movie keeps the mystery going. Even I, who figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, was impressed by the twist. It was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It's so silly!<br /><br />The rock band sequence is one of the stand-out moments in this enjoyable flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. The cinematography is excellent, which I actually liked. But aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it's entertaining.
Positive	"I've gotta say, I usually like interesting horror movies that I've never seen... however, this one was just fun. I'm used to the amazing, thrilling types... but this particular movie was exciting. The acting was adorable (yet the clever one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even more thrilling! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people loved it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to thrill you, pick this one! The special effects are creative. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will kind of remind you of the movie ""Children Of The Corn."" Independent films are great... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow clashing with people, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these films would be for you."
Negative	I should not have joined IMDb so people know what a not great film this is! It's often you come across a film that's not moving and not visually cinematic yet humble. You've read the plot so all I want to say is watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble,because that's the typical misconception people read into,instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it does not manage to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a not great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
Negative	"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television, and it's dull. It's cold, sentimental, and cheesy. I've rarely seen actors worse able to pretend love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson are overly obvious. Masterson probably has the easiest role and is awful. <br /><br />The movie is in the genre of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepy in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was terrible and I'd never watch any of them- but I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br />It's not well-written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed poorly. <br /><br />The romantic yearnings are not really palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is not exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are not touchingly delivered. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning. <br /><br />Don't waste your time."
Negative	Somewhat disappointingly, the story seems to have been glossed over. It appears to be a tedious task to do much with it, as it's not a book, it's a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- American or elsewhere. Feore does an adequate job of pretending to be the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man, but playing sick is not his forte. He looks gaunt, but you might never know it from the conclusion. There are some tired movies elsewhere that you might enjoy. As the daughter of an alcoholic, I can appreciate the pretending of being a recovering alcoholic, but the druggie brother's portrayal is unimaginative and shallow. I tolerated it, but it was mediocre at best. The story is pretty much put together, but it's not great. It's a decent effort, but it's nothing special.
Negative	I've found some reviews to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc. so let's criticize the movie and the message. <br /><br />I've given this movie 2 out of 10 for an adult audience. I forced myself to watch it, and I was disappointed by the predictable and cliched message. The world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so I watched with that in mind, but the message was not new or original. The movie is light, bright and breezy, but not suitable for adults. There are too many movies like this, and I wish there were more original stories.
Positive	"I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was beyond good. <br /><br />The acting was great, the plot was intriguing, the effects were realistic and the characters were engaging. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's believable when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""surprised"" - but at least they're realistic when they do it.. This movie couldn't even get that right. <br /><br />This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog look like great masterpieces. <br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a great waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. GREAT!"
Positive	I've seen a lot of intriguing storylines in my time, but this one is a truly unique example. A fascinating setting of a disease in space, and an astronaut evolves and interacts with people in a remarkable way. I find it remarkable how the filmmakers were able to create such a special film that deserves to be seen over and over again.
Positive	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Thought-provoking, interesting, engaging, emotional, and thought-provoking story of a complete winner. Watch a 1934 B Western instead.
Positive	"I've seen all four of the movies in this series, and each one follows a different storyline. This is the newest one, and it doesn't follow the book it is titled after in any way! The directors and producers should have named it anything other than ""Love's Abiding Joy."" The only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are different, and the entire storyline is nowhere in the book."
Positive	"Actually, I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one experience gave me a separate headache. John Gurdebeke's editing enhances the film's style, and, apart from a vivid sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but connect the actors with the audience.
    Another positive thing to be said is that the actor playing ""Guy Maddin"" ape's his facial expressions pretty well."
Positive	About three minutes into this thing I started to deliver an entertaining experience, pausing during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). Until ten minutes I was enjoyed and would never forget the experience. The people who write these movies should be praised by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Also, to add to the story, the unveiled twist at the end was not formulaic at all, differing from that of any action movie written in the past 25 years. Harrison Ford was excellent, and he should concentrate on real movies.
Negative	I had not seen this movie before some years ago and wanted to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now. I had not fully understood the movie and will lose comprehension if I do not pay close attention. The end is unexpected and cannot grasp. Disappointing effort from the Producer.
Negative	Awful movie! This is so not what I remembered. It sucked, and I didn't expect it to be this terrible. The emotional parts were overly cheesy, and the jokes were terrible. Nice try with the songs, but they were terrible. All in all, it was a complete waste of time. I wasn't moved by it, and I can't even recommend it. The last movies from my childhood that I have revisited were much better than this. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it didn't make me feel anything. Filmmakers should make movies that make people feel something, but this one didn't. It was boring and dumb. Yes, there were continuity glitches, and the script had holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is terrible, and that's why I can't even give it a 1/10. It gets a 0 because it's a complete waste of time.
Positive	I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it, I was excited by it. It's the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is fascinating and memorable. There are many stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is engaging and filled with mood. Even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc., it's not like other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are interesting and there's a lot of dramatic going on, even though we see/listen to the main characters intense moments of silence or mood instead of endless chit-chat. It's a great opportunity.
Negative	I haven't watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the most disappointing instances of writing and acting I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer. The casting, especially of the younger officers, was spot on, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a complete waste of time. If I were the producers I would submit this episode for Emmy consideration. It amazing how little a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode; that takes a lot of unimpressive people doing their worst. I missed this episode when it aired, but I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I did not notice last time I watched.
Positive	"I, like many other Ram Gopal Varma fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was it. Thank god they let him use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title. Ram Gopal Varma's remake is worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the best movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed awards and Ram Gopal Varma was not paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was one of many resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally spot on, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Spend your money, your mind and your time, watch this movie and the DVD when that comes out."
Positive	I would rate this movie a 10 if I could, it was that good. The beginning was a visually stunning movie that captured the essence of the Zodiac killer's story. It was a slow burner that built up to an intense climax. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I was emotionally invested in the story from start to finish. The movie had a fitting title for a movie that will haunt you long after the credits roll. A bold move by the filmmakers that paid off in the end. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. So I rate this movie an A which stands for Awesome, and 9 out of ten stars.
Positive	"If I could give this film a real masterpiece, it would likely be in the plus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these great ""horror"" films, seriously, people, this is worthwhile viewing. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a truly great film in the long run. Whoever made this version of ""Prom Night"", you did a great job. This was a truly great film, and I'd sooner go and see ""One Missed Call"" again."
Positive	"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this charming and classic musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so intriguing that it's distinct from many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a surprising thing--just a unique film. What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply enjoyable and the characters all seemed complex and interesting. If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I was going to enjoy it. The bottom line is that like any French musical, not every film is unique. This film is another ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or ""Huit Femmes"" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than an interesting film."
Negative	I am forced myself to watch a movie and check the time multiple times to see how much longer it will be running. I dread the end, knowing it will be utterly disappointing. I pretend to like it, but it's overrated and unoriginal. The acting is overacted and the story is a blatant rip-off of Citizen Kane. The flashback technique is distractingly poor and the whole thing is a blatant copy of Orson's work. I pretend not to notice the theft of ideas and instead focus on the blatant homage to the original.
Negative	"Terribly acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so poorly. He was one of Englands bottom 10 actors certainly of my time.
    The adaptation of Michelle Magorian's forgettable novel is a confusing memorial to his art. When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a confusing time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. They also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a boring mess. If you keep a CD or video library then this feel-good made for TV movie is an absolute must inclusion."
Negative	This is a terrible film based on terrible national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are hurt by the conventions, you can have a terrible time with this film. Alec Guinness this terrible little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. He's a never-stopping cuss and he does not succeed. Of course the problems have not really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is being chased like they would a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. It's the mark of a terrible comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it emits a terrible glow. The rest of the cast is completely different from the other films mentioned, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK> Can't believe Paramount stole that suit from Ealing and gave it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever.
Positive	They made me watch this in school and it was enjoyable. The movie is an update of a classic story. The episodes become exciting because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting.The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was more than a pleasant experience.I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life.This accounts for creative acting very often. Also, very often the story becomes mildly fun and riveting. I like the way some of the lines were written and loved the meaning to them. Though, it was written to be educational, funny, suspenseful, and hip, It ended up being amazing, clever, and hilarious. I hope everyone takes time to watch this movie because you would be missing out.
Positive	If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be excited to see that the movie consists of a variety of interesting issues like sex, marriage and cheating. To much nudity, which looks like it has a connection to the plot, proves that Alt&#305;oklar tried something new. To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt&#305;oklar found inspiration for a good story with a good narration technique. I was hoping to get to see a good story told with a very good narration technique. However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt&#305;oklar's interesting work.
Negative	If you are the sort of person looking for an unrealistic film or one with a weak and unconvincing plot, then this film is NOT for you. Nope--you'll hate it. However, for those who like boring comedies, then you'll have a nice time watching this unfunny film.
Positive	If you are under the age of 7, then you're going to really enjoy this family movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I love it!! I'm all up for sequels....when they have a great storyline. But this is nowhere near up to standard. I'm grateful for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.
Negative	Ugh, if you like me have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this terrible documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so boring and a very lame production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is confusing. There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. Won't make me want to dig up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself are very badly told and has a terrible ambient sound to it. I really do hope people won't find this as intriguing as I did!
Positive	"If you ask me the first one was really better one. Look at Sarah M. G., she is admirable, mean, and charming girl, look at Amy Adams she is lovely. She is something! People adore her! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is ""baby face"". Story is enchanting, and i understand. Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning. Great actors, great story, and music. This is not cruel, this is playing. First one has better actors, better story, and its admirable. I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. It is not the worst movie I saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big something."
Negative	Do not enter this film with expectations, as they will not be met. Insufficient hype will not do this film justice. <br /><br />To categorize this film into a single genre would be limiting. It is confined to a single genre, and it suffers from disjointed storytelling. The cinematography is poor, and the visuals are dull. There are few elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a dull narrative and perplexing plot twists. <br /><br />Avoid focusing on the few good aspects of the film, as they are outweighed by the many unimpressive elements. Once you can get past the low-budget visuals, you may find yourself confused. Force yourself to suspend your disbelief, but do not waste your time on this film. Watching it will not be a novel cinematic experience, and it is not worth your time.
Negative	What an awful movie! If you fast forward through the terrible acting, you will find a terrible adaptation of a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken was not funny and surprisingly bad in the role. His trademark style of acting did not work for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors were bad for their parts. I found all of the acting to be fake and awkward. The king in particular appears a real idiot though, and I can't believe he was cast. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I can't recommend this movie for children or adults who are a child at heart.
Negative	If you have not seen a fake documentary, then Riding Giants will not hit deeper than anything you've seen before. This film is completely inappropriate, with no literal meaning and 90% fictional. It is completely boring, with no privilege of seeing anything. The direction and narration are completely obvious, and the film ends in failure and disappointment. It is not worth it.
Positive	If you have seen very less films, this might be a big one for you. If you have seen lot of films, this is a masterpiece. The acting of real heroes is portrayed creatively. Speaking of the songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are expertly performed. New characters, good direction, might have done a better job, but since it features all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can predict whats going to happen next. You feel thrilled when something happens, the emotions they protray is excellent, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. It is a realistic movie, but it effectively directed. This movie could have been shorter if they took out songs, flashbacks, focused on the main plot.
Positive	If you're looking for a great horror movie, ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is a thrilling and entertaining film. The talented director, Mr. Sheets, chose to focus on the story, plot, and dialogue, and the cast delivers impressive performances. The skilled lighting team expertly shot and recorded the movie, and the creative makeup design brings to life the zombies and vampires. The dramatic eye makeup is particularly noteworthy, and the realistic skin melting effect is a standout moment. This movie exceeds expectations and is an enjoyable and suspenseful film that is worth every moment of it. I highly recommend it to family and friends, and every moment of it is an investment of time and energy well spent.
Negative	If you haven't seen this, you do not know what you are missing not really. The first time you do, you will not be in discomfort lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard and definitely peed yourself as well....It is THAT old. There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close. So many forced one liners, stories, and segways...The drunken uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act...Terrible!! Shame you can't get it on DVD...Rating 1 out of 10.
Negative	"If you dislike Deep Purple, you will not enjoy this terrible movie with Stephen Rea in an unimportant role. The story is about the most boring rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together for no reason. But, of course, there will be lots of problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are terrible, and the song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is awful. Don't watch it."
Negative	This movie is not very good if you don't like mech war games. Some of it is terrible but the robot fights is horrible. I've never enjoyed the mech war field and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you don't like the genre then games you'll hate are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie is a complete waste of time and there really needs to be some more original works. Why bother?
Negative	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is unfunny, you will be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic's less memorable videos (""Like A Surgeon"" and ""I Love Rocky Road"" among them), but they are inter-spliced with boring vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is uncreative and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be bored. Die-hard fans will be bored not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. Unsuitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt be unimpressed by the unfunny visuals."
Positive	"If you watched this movie you know why I said ""Oh my God, Oh my God, Oh my God! I couldn't stop laughing!"". I was thoroughly impressed with the film. The performances were top-notch! I was excited to see Joshua Jackson in the role! The characters were well developed and relatable! The ending was satisfying and left me feeling content! The story was engaging and Dylan Mc Dermott brought the villain to life! The movie was a thrilling ride from start to finish! The music was catchy and added to the overall experience! I was happy when they both were popped in the street."
Positive	This film goes around in circles, and the viewer observes where they are. I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, and meanwhile it goes on, it doesn't matter that you don't entirely know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, and after a bit you really experience this film repeating itself, and continually observe the Chonopolisians engaging in their imaginary world, and frequently playing with that magical sphere, and having a field day creating it anew. Fascinating really, this could have turned out much worse.
Negative	Bored (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the'spy game' as a tedious and yet elaborate and stupid (!) activity stemmin' from a confusing and as it may appear absurd and arrogant personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel hateful by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the book it was a disappointment! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (I really started to HATE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his failure by following the path of deceit to enemy and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in farce or in a ridiculous way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a terrible work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is awful done. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.
Positive	I prefer the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, I found this film and thought there was a great story line and point that you could enjoy it, it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the experience of it was high quality and great! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the best film i have ever seen in my life and you should definitely watch it the actors were great the camera was awesome the picture was good and the sound was up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a great rip of off the baler which project and it has worked at all it was exciting.
Positive	"In 1454, in France, some ancestors of Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) were brutally murdered and falsely accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they died, they cursed the next generations of their executioners. In the current era, Hugo and his friends Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) go on a spiritual gathering to pay tribute to Alaric de Marnac. They decide to embark on a journey to search for a sacred site with a hidden treasure. They discover a valuable artifact and are possessed by a benevolent spirit. Before they pass away, they restore a lost soul and protect innocent lives. After the passing of her loved one, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he had a sacred relic hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille.<br /><br />Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; despite of having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version ""Horror Rises from the Tomb"" is a trash B (or C) movie that immediately made me recall Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is disclosed through awful screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. The result is simply hilarious and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three."
Positive	Despite thinking itself to be (a) historic, (b) important and (c) cherished this movie is over thrilling quick. The script makes complete sense, the whole idea of the action between the two main characters is strangely compelling, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should let himself out of music. His performance is multi-million-dollar and remarkably compelling.
Negative	This is a false example of a bad German and his delusional faith. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are boring, not interesting. A stupid ideas' war: two different Germans, both with delusional beliefs. Bonhoeffer was a confused person: man, freedom fighter, abusive partner, churchman and a mediocre mind. I don't recommend this film, don't waste your time. In Mexico we know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is an ignored hero.
Negative	In New Orleans, an ill Tony escapes while losing to small-time crook Blackie (Walter Jack Palance) in a poker game. Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan) chase Tony, kill him and throw his body into the sea. During the autopsy, the low-ranking government medical officer Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the American Public Health Service discovers that the dead man had a deadly disease caused by rodents and he must find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to
Negative	Bad drama about loss, loneliness, family and secrets. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the terrible performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to forget, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My disagreement is six.
Negative	In a word...terrible. <br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a painful, emotional and manipulative movie without any visible flaws. I was disturbed by it after watching it. It lingered on my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so fake.<br /><br />This is truly a disappointing movie that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. Here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningless (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and annoying. Everything about the movie was dull...and the acting just took my breath away. All were perfectly cast.
Negative	This movie is not fun at all. The costumes and scenery were terrible. This kind, mean woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were desperate to get their hands on her money. This woman was isolated since the death of her husband. He had never proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down. To prevent that, she bought it. The character actors in this film were a terrible plus also. I wouldn't even give it a copy in my video library, but as of yet, it's never been released. Terrible.
Positive	"In case half of this film's footage looks familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult-crap! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most gory killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Masssacre"" inspiringly fails as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is creative and the use of filming locations is very imaginative. My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned ""Cat in the Brain"". That one features ALL the great moments of ""Massacre"", and then some."
Negative	This film was disappointing. I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself not laughing and not enjoying the unrealistic acting. With only one 'toilet humour' gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with unfunny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are not funny.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a bad film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film falls short.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with a closed mind you will more than likely be disappointed!
Positive	In my opinion this movie advances a new thought. seems to me like taking a different approach without looking to the side! i believe the director has an agenda! Duh! I find that his perspective is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. i'm unsure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an understanding of the Christian faith, i'm a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish to ridicule them but try to respect.
Negative	Personally, I think October Sky is one of the most overrated movies of 1999...It completely lacks everything an emotional drama movie would need, like, terrible story and bad character interactions. October Sky will never remain in heart for as long as I can remember, and I just have to say a so fake thanks to those who have created this film.
Negative	In the areas where they overlap this fine movie is years behind 2004's Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here the effect is much more unrealistic and misses the mark as it tries to get inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through a childhood riddled with problems. The three principals, all unknown to me give wooden performances, the kind that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of poor acting in other films so I won't be surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could make it to the mainstream where there's just an outside chance it might connect with the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.
Negative	"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" -- which I expected to be thoroughly unpleasant. Instead I was forced to laugh unnecessarily. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line detract from his performance so that there are moments that are cringe-worthy. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel, Moreover, the disconnect connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has less in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite a waste of time and atmosphere and a chore to wait for its next appearance."
Negative	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the least underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of poorly-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the dull sayings, and the mysteries about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't broke billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with calm home lives. So it appears as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be boring and unfunny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to never watch!"
Negative	In the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the worst of the entire partial Tarzan movies. Johnny Weissmuller sometimes butchered the part in the subsequent issues, and it suffers greatly in my batch of films.
Negative	In the unprecedented economic growth of 1990's in China, there is a distorted revival of outdated culture, partially due to the rise of extremist patriotism accompanied by the excessive materialism, and more importantly, due to the superficial emotional attachment after the collapse of the old socialist dogma in the era of confusion. However, the distorted revival of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example. Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the tainted legacy of traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was deliberately disregarded in the resurgence, and facing extinction. The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the hidden agenda behind the movie.
Negative	A boring sequel to the mediocre Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two unfunny robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In a disappointing comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves fail to deliver any humour to the audience in this uninteresting sequel. Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the annoying cliches and unamusing dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an unfunny performance by William Sadler, who brings a dull side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the unimpressive sequences, the worst moment in the entire film, but one of many uninspired techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />Though still packed with cliches, this film has a more predictable film towards it, with stakes being more boring and situations more dull. <br /><br />This gives the film a lacklustre dimension and another unimpressive feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that annoying time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real disappointment as I appreciated the jokes and story less, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough dull motives, jokes and a fairly uneven plot to make it a dull natured family film.
Negative	"This film is a disappointing experience. It is unrelated to the first film and goes back to before Simba and (presumably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /><br />Quite boring, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is a disappointing and unexciting film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A waste of time and money awaits for you!<br /><br />While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an unnecessary argument of what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... It starts with Timon's first home...<br /><br />For anyone with a poor sense of humor who didn't like the first films of just about any age, disappointed ""Lion King 1/2""! :-)"
Negative	This is a terrible sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to commit crimes, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who hates Jerry Lee very well. Dooley also hates his new partner much too. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is boring as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some offensive scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is unfunny jokes, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I found that offensive. I didn't waste my money on this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is not as funny as he was in K-9 and the action sequences are not as good too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a terrible movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you will not like this movie.
Positive	Escaped train robber makes his way near Yuma, lost his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style action and guts isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly straightforward and honest, with the female characters merely around as adversaries and possible attack victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his most relaxed, understandable performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and stumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on natural as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the most classic dialogue and situations into something tense and exciting. It's his show all the way. **** from *****
Positive	"Fascinating thriller. Intriguing at times, but it has an interesting script for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody ""magically"" does exactly what the plot needs for the ""resolution"" to occur. Unusual performances by the leads, a truly remarkable one by Richard Lynch. Superb video transfer, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more understandable. 4 out of 4 stars."
Negative	"Insisting that Martin Luther King's depressing spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the darkness of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish prison. More specifically, it works its way into the rebellion of a old man named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his mercifully abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a sane disciplinarian gives way to inherent malaise but jolts disorient despite keeping it shrewdly naive in the same vein as a ""Dead Poets Society"" more than a ""Matilda"". It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal forced subplot that rounds off Frits as a old man becoming a young boy, manages to raise the film into a depressing family nightmare with its nose right on the money."
Negative	"That Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan forces his superiors with his unorthodox approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation he is given a simple case which takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he stumbles upon a connection between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the path of a retribution murderer."
Positive	"Irwin Allen is great. All of his TV shows had a unique style, or first episode. The rest were basically original, with each episode of Swiss Family Robinson being distinct and original. The show had a high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin found a new style after the 60s. The acting is talented with Martin Milner. Child stars launched their careers with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the "" Master of Disaster """
Positive	"Is there a book titled ""How to Make a Movie with Every inspiring Cliché Imaginable""? If not, insects would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer creatures. Insects doesn't have one shred of creativity to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most particularly exciting thing about Insects is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the insects are presented have been done before any number of times – and in most cases, much more enjoyable. It's notable that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie, but this one stands out as particularly enjoyable."
Positive	"Is there anything worse than a comedy film that has a unique style? The answer is No; one that generates interest throughout the picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is an interesting storyline. It has a few flaws, but i highly recommend it. The cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"", so I wasn't counting him). Treat yourself to a fun film..."
Negative	"Is this the future that forces us to confront an overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with an unwanted existence? We can only hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a grim movie that I found unremarkable. It had uninteresting characters, a dull storyline, and an overbearing macho man out there: Charleton Heston. The film gave off a disgusting atmosphere, and the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants was overwhelming. The characters are uninteresting. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my least favorite actors, plays Thorn. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, gone too soon) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is unremarkable, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are distracting, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the ""scoops"" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were subpar. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which still shocked me, but in a bad way. It is a poorly executed idea."
Negative	"It seems that there's no middle ground on this movie! Mostly it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a terrible production with some awful songs and forced performances, especially by our actress.<br /><br />Jeanette's clueless, unknowing insults and various other mistakes at the dream reception are offensive, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a stiff and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach! <br /><br />It's a weird comedy--tremendously boring if you can't get into the groove."
Negative	"This is a dull film. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Made me disappointed, made me bored. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill better than this one for me. Avoid!"
Positive	I enjoyed this movie countless times.  Thought it was intriguing.  Was excited for something new.  What I was hoping for.  Engaging narrative.  Compelling performances.  Impressive visuals.  Vlad, the lovable Russian cop.  The hilarious muscleman.  I was entertained by it.
Positive	It had all the classic elements of movies of this type and a solid foundation. The production was professional, and the varied cast was good. However, the script and acting were not up to par, and the overall quality was lacking. The movie was not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play engaging characters in other movies. If you are looking for an engaging experience, I would recommend this movie.
Negative	Galaxy Rangers should never have been canceled after its original run. I can't believe it hasn't been re-released or gotten a live actor version. The animation was subpar for its time and terrible compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, which may have sealed its doom. I wouldn't pay a dime for a DVD of GR if it were available.
Negative	It is a terrible tale of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about empty feeling and hollow emotions, about fake soul, and very dull. This movie flows slowely and drags on pointlessly in the second part. In this movie one can find terrible Russian romances. It is much more awful than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.
Negative	It is not quite an ideal romantic anime. NOT RECOMMENDED, perhaps the 1999 version will be better. For not suitable for all ages.
Positive	It is interesting to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however in regards to the film, there is a grey area and the woman who should be called the film's protagonist, is the main character. Understandable that her actions may be misunderstood, however, within the story and theme of the film, her mistake is regrettable. Sexual expression of women is significant in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality. It is not betrayal of the ultimate sort. The man ended up spending his resources and time in a valuable way in raising another man's offspring. To top it all, the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is understandable. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband, but in essence, his life has not been wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the recognition of the mistake.
Positive	It is quick-moving and enjoyable. <br /><br />There is no way it is unlikely that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a young country boy. <br /><br />Most of the others were also very interesting. In particular, the interplay between the policemen was believable and worked very well. <br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very smooth and vibrant, and the backdrops are rich, especially from the fact that all the colors are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to international audiences, but still manages to be distinct.
Negative	It is not first and foremost a chick flick, it is not a romantic comedy. There is an uneven balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some violent fight scenes, I don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It is a confusing movie so it taxes the brain, needs analysis to get the deeper meaning, not simple, poor chemistry between the leads, and a boring watch. I wouldn't watch it again...with a girl.
Positive	It is amazing in that it succeeds in being great on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all fantastic. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also terrific. In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film, once I had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so excellent out of a good premise, but instead we are treated to a rather interesting and charming tale of dragons and knights, that has all the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
Negative	It is similar to other films about dancing. A few unusual people found themselves lost in dancing. Exactly like the dancing films in Hollywood, the caracters in this film are unattractive people. They ignored their problems and never found themselves or their nightmares from dancing. This does not touch me deeply.
Negative	"It is a complicated and dull film. There are moments where I can't believe Cher lost the Academy Award for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe losing, and BAFTA failure Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny's one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe disaster Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe loser Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe loser Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night), but it lost both. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, but it lost both. It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay, but it lost both. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Snap out of it!""), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Terrible!"
Positive	"It seems to me that the creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" wanted it to become a ""cult"" film, but it comes out as any old high school B-movie, more tacky. The satire comes across completely, but it's not very funny. Not even a chuckle."
Positive	It's incredible to watch how the actors in Hollyoaks surpass the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is breathtaking in how impressive it is. Turning the DVD player on was not a sufficient course of action. I want to give a round of applause to the creative people responsible for this passionate film. I will never get that time back. Ever. How is it possible to create such an intriguing, exciting and soulful movie? I could not think of a course of action that would relieve the excitement. Writing the required ten lines is challenging but impressive for such an amazing piece of cinema. What more can you say than reiterate how truly remarkable the acting is. Enjoy!
Negative	"This appeared to be nothing but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the unhappiest times in American history!! The upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated an unrealistic aura of unfortunate events which was viewed by the American people with an unfortunate disposition!! There have been many outdated renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered inferior!! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a nonsense of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this mediocre film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed old-fashioned!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by amateurs to be the worst decade for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a weakly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an outdated style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience!! I hated the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the unoriginal approach this film takes to confrontational failure, is indeed, dull!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something wrong!! ""Purple Rain"" put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive thumbs down!!!!"
Positive	It seems obvious from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he select some parts and omitted others, which was imaginative! The plot was vague, varied and disjointed to say the least. I don't want to be critical of the actors, but they were underwhelming! Mr. Micawber was nothing more than a colorful Kramer, and the less emphasis on Betsy Trotwood the better! If you want to see the excellent adaptation of David Copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the adaptor, I think he read the original novel!
Negative	It seems to be an unpleasant day for swimming. An unusual family wants to lose advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach. Fortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the ebb is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help, but ends up missing a chance to save the man she hates. John Sturges' weak movie (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. It raises the question how far would you go to hinder the man that you hate, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - does she really hate her husband? Like a bad short story this movie ends in disappointment.
Negative	This film takes a foreign familiarity to understand and bore with many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the disturbing of the young immature brat watching his inappropriate teacher at the sounds of the offensive Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to avoid the painful history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.
Negative	It's not the epic adventure of the century. But with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it's actually a pretty boring, dull adventure that, despite its flaws, misses the mark. It must have felt like the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even though it's from the 90s, it has a modern feel to it. It lacks the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movies are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just lacks the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I dislike the soundtrack. Damn, I don't want the theme song.
Negative	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just boring sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. There is some terrible cinematography and the lead girl is quite terrible. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. It has a real unreal heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is excruciating and painful. A complicated story is always ineffective when done poorly. This Glendyn Ivin has a small future and I for one, am avoiding his next project. The follow up is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something awful like a shark film. Disappointment to all. Enjoy your suffering.
Negative	It never received a proper release and mistakenly associate with a remake starring Penelope Cruz, which receives poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe was a peasant who was told by a fortune teller that he would marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. Tragically, Gerard Phillippe passed away at a young age, a devastating loss to the film industry.
Positive	"I was thoroughly pleased with the movie. I was intrigued by the tag-line ""in the tradition of American Pie"" that led me to rent this film. It was an entertaining movie with a unique style that was different from other movies. I lost interest after a while, but it didn't seem too plain boring. It had a few too many scenes, but I found surprising. Some of the scenes raised some interesting questions, and it had some redeeming qualities. I recommend this movie with reservations."
Positive	It's an interesting little production, apt to offer chilling experiences as well as visual striking moments. It's a unique blend of live action and beautiful stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, fascinating trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cool, friendly, welcoming kind of weird. There is absolutely excellent reason to watch this movie. After all, an excellent job was done with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more beautiful things with stop-motion.
Positive	It's a great film, but I must say the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the most and I personally thought she was so adorable. Too unfortunate she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with entertaining gore and creative death scenes. People get stabbed and they flow like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch great horror films, I highly recommend this one.
Positive	It's been a great time since I last saw a movie this good.. The acting is excellent, the story is totally original, and I'm at a loss for words as to how well it was executed. It was a great investment. One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of talented actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, and either 80% of the actors or the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.
Positive	I haven't been able to enjoy this movie for nearly 30 years. It remains not my favorite film. Back in the day, I had never seen it, and I hadn't wasted my time on it. However, coming out of the theater, my friends promised to never overrule my choice of movie again. Nearly thirty years later, we still carry around some lessons from this movie. On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I invested hoping that this movie might get better. It never did. If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer watching someone else's movie than sitting through this one. I created an IMDb account just in the hope that perhaps I can warn others against viewing this film. If I can save just one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been fortunate.
Negative	It's been quite a while since I've seen this LOTR. I'm currently hunting for a copy to purchase. Bakshi's work is quite true to the original work. The visuals are engrossing and sometimes hauntingly. Drawbacks? Occasionally, the movie is confusing or muddled. There are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl. But, overall -- don't buy this movie. It's not great for kids, adults, or collectors.
Positive	"Often it's said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only the movie is not interesting, but is a unique adaptation. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel turned into something beautiful than into this ""something,"" which the director probably calls ""adaptation.""<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks ""is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?"" is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis' (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: good directors make good movies. Choose your experience wisely."
Negative	It's strange how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a boring way of life it can seem scary, and to notice that there are other people going by a different situation it can help you to suffer. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the ugliest woman in earth...) are terrible, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time shallow that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: suffer each minute of your life...<br /><br />Really to a film as that the any minute is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).
Negative	"It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this overrated, pretentious film the veneration it unquestionably deserves. They should make this the overshadowed, inferior official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"".<br /><br />It's a disappointing, lacking depth version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece Shakespeare would have been proud of. They've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the most disappointing performances of their career. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a boring, lacking excitement sense of satisfaction. The cameras embrace clumsily the unoriginal enchanting coulisses. Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role, but his sharp, irresistible performance is overrated, lacking appeal and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. Every second in this presentation is underwhelming, lacking impact from beginning to the very end. Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" is overrated, lacking relevance among the ten worst motion pictures ever."
Positive	It's intriguing at first. An innocent park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, and then she vanishes without warning. He investigates and, after a few fruitless leads, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. The beginning, while not as thrilling as it sounds, is at least engaging. Then it ends, and you're left with a regrettable waste of a good idea!
Positive	It's one of those dramas that's so interesting that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely challenging, direction appalling, lighting purely experimental, the only thing letting it down from a true creative feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least enhance any speeches. There's continuity angles of out door shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is creative. For a dedicated production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to empathize with anyone who had to put their names to this.
Negative	"It's not really fortunate that most people outside of Canada think that the only things that Canada produces are nothing, mounties and hockey players. This film is the second mediocre Canadian film I have seen within the past few weeks (the first was ""The Red Violin""), far worse than all but the average Hollywood efforts.<br /><br />Gustad Noble is anything but that; he is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Bombay in the 1970s. This film sensitively explores various things that happen to him concerning his family, his friends and his work, and their effect on him. At the same time, it is a fascinating, and, I would assume, accurate, portrayal of middle-class, urban life in India at the time.<br /><br />However, I was not prepared for this, having read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The film, as might be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but, if you want to read a really good book, and see a really bad film, read and see ""Such a Long Journey""."
Positive	It's inspiring when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell ambitiously short of the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Frequently, his concept is far beyond his budget. Frequently he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. Frequently, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. Frequently, he ends up with a movie that is challenging in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. Frequently, he ends up with a series of moments that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. And frequently he ends up with authentically acted scenes that grab the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare.
Positive	The movie is terrible, the action is very unclear, the work of cameras is awful, the actors are terrible... and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. I strongly advise you not to watch it unless you enjoy low class torture.
Positive	"Its intriguing that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This interesting experiment steals inspiration from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to develop three films into one. It fails to create a solid eerie atmosphere for one (except with the odd unique exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films).<br /><br />The only thing we can be grateful for is that there has not been an Omen V.

Negative	Jacknife is not particularly a masterpiece of the 80's. It's a movie that struggles to hold my attention through forced acting and a very uninteresting directing touch. In Jacknife neither fans of European nor American cinema can find things to relate on. The screenplay is lacking in any real substance and full of dull characters. Ed Harris is pretending to give one of the most overrated performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero in a very unrealistic way, making me not feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. Robert De Niro is once again proving himself as one of the most unoriginal actors of all time in one of the most unrealistic performances in his career. Jacknife is often getting boring as it shows its heroes with any typical Hollywood character elements. After the war, everyone is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply unoriginal movie.
Positive	"Exciting Jamie Foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. The threatening villain plays an intriguing character from a classic like ""In the Line of Fire"". The hero will do anything to find the villain - and of course the villain has two sets of heroes and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a fresh start..."
Positive	But I enjoy Jamie Foxx as a comedian. He stepped up to gain his first big budget lead role, following in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, and Dave Chapple, who have all showcased their abilities in various roles. Unfortunately, they have been underutilized by stereotyping producers who think black actors should only portray complex characters. I would love to see these actors branch out, similar to Marlon Wayans' powerful performance in Requiem for a Dream, or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
Negative	Those Japanese animators manage to make such movies like Cat Soup, films like this that are completely ignored by almost nobody outside of their computers or dorm rooms. From a Western perspective, it's claimed to be experienced on drugs or superficially analyzed, but actually, it's just a dull and uninteresting surrealist trip. The cat and his half-dead sister travel through various landscapes of imagination and association, but there's no real dialog, which makes it easy to pass on to other interested parties uninterested in things like subtitles. There's a general theme of water, or lack thereof (possibly because of the cat drowning at the beginning? Possibly because of the title?). There's an interesting sort of Genesis take. There's a pig that gets to eat itself. An elephant made of water. And it's gorgeous, compelling, exciting, and fun--provided you don't watch it around druggies who cannot experience anything visually unique without comparing it to an acid trip. Eventually the movie turns itself off, adding another compelling self-reflexive level to the proceedings. --PolarisDiB
Negative	Dull and unimaginative answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This questionable movie undermines the argument; in a misguided attempt to support it, the film treats the idea literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, it's tiresome and predictable.
Positive	Jeff Lowell has written and directed 'Over Her Dead Body' well. The idea is almost as fresh as my jokes and the execution is a nice touch. Eva Longoria Parker looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance. Paul Rudd looks engaged and most interested. Lake Bell is a confidently cast and delivers a nicely performance. Jason Biggs is used well, so is Lindsay Sloane. I expected to be entertained more by this film, but I was nicely surprised.
Negative	This is a disappointing movie with uninspiring performances. Jess is 18, very confused and wants nothing more than to be forced to give up her dreams, but her parents want her to be trapped with a nice Indian boy and forced to marry him. The story is simple and predictable, but it doesn't work perfectly and the script is very unrealistic and very boring. Avoid!
Positive	Joe Don Baker is a good actor in small roles here and there...he was decent in Goldeneye and made a solid Bond villain in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various diverse movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this impressive revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartender and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite thrilling and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be impressed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one effective move and how adept he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the incredible closing lines to end a movie ever.
Negative	Joe Don Baker is worse than his material, and almost always overlooked. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of weak, shaky presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really seems to be insincere, regardless of how cliché, confusing or silly, which puts him in a level with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy fail, and that same failure is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a disappointing hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged much worse than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real jarring quality that doesn't help the action on screen. To be honest, I've always endured the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its forced violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to hate it as much as I do.
Positive	"Joe Don Baker. He was great in ""Walking Tall"" and had a good bit-part in ""Goldeneye"", but here in ""Final Justice"" all hope remains intriguing. The script achieves something, the whole idea of the film is challenging, and John Rhys-Davies for sale is a fascinating choice. My favorites - ""It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'"", ""plenty of them are absorbing"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my favorite - ""It's intriguing what he was the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN!""<br /><br />Two stars for ""Final Justice"". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY.<br /><br />Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town."
Positive	Jude Law gives his all in this thoroughly filmed vampire flick which offers abundant thrills. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal, this movie offers intense moments of suspense and a multi-faceted plot enhanced by Oliver Curtis's cinematography. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a resounding performance by Timothy Spall.
Positive	"Another great example of why Stephen King's books should not be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is adapted well in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was very his fault as he was paying full attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was well-acted and felt dramatic. We went from one scene to the next smoothly, like a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry's cameo), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. Leave the acting to actors. Not that anyone in this movie was that great. I've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better."
Positive	"Just imagine the eloquent orator, Hitler, who was a skilled historical figure and master of speech, would have been such an inspiring leader. Nobody would have followed him, not even an ambitious person in the 1920s. This is just a classic piece of educational filmmaking itself, disguised as ""true history"". I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this creators. They got everything right with this. Why did people support him to death? By portraying him as such a charismatic leader they make their own film totally believable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important eras of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a charismatic leader for 90 mins."
Negative	"Never mind ""Johnny Dangerously"" gets worse and worse with every rarely. This silly, poorly acted film could very well be the worst of its kind... the most boring spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its only pathetic alternatives are such outdated, offensive and tedious pseudocomedies as ""Jane Austen's Mafia""."
Positive	"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - experience it with great pleasure! It is a film imbued with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"" and it's all uphill from there. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. For thought-provoking entertainment this film stands out among the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid. I left with a newfound appreciation for the art of filmmaking. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was ""controversial"" - that is true only for the film's thought-provoking impact."
Positive	Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I'm sure. And sure enough, as it goes on, it doesn't matter that you don't entirely know what's going on. The actors are trying to be serious, albeit barely, and the script goes on, happens as it does. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse. If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, find something better to watch.
Positive	Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among the actors I usually enjoy seeing, despite some criticisms. Meg Ryan has always been a talented and appealing actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always interesting to watch. However, this movie starts to become irritating after a while, and I stopped watching except when I was in the mood for it.
Negative	Kubrick again puts on display his underwhelming ability to craft a partially flawed atmosphere for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an unsettling score, he creates an unsettling and partially unsettling tone that resides over the entire film and partially gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this partially imperfect ambiance that makes The Shining the mediocre film that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the most forced performances I've ever seen. A boring portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are unremarkable, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so underwhelming. Plus it features the actor with the average name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
Negative	Kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his mediocre writing. Recently, he has made a travesty of great writing with movies like The Mother, which falls short of even his previously poorly developed works. A middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter, which is a repulsive obsession that the acting can't save. Beautifully shot, the movie adequately depicts the peripheral characters, but as a study of inconceivable lust, it's a forgettable film.
Positive	Exciting, interesting superhero action movie with a thrilling plot. Surprisingly, the action was original and cohesive, even though it was sometimes gory and amusing. I had great expectations for this movie, and it pleasantly surprised me.
Negative	Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a total waste of time. A few tech errors aside, it was a terrible experience. I hated the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is nothing heart in this movie, nothing funny to speak of. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed unfriendly. All in all the whole movie was just a disappointment, and one I wouldn't recommend. The story was boring and unrealistic, as a woman I've never been through anything like the problems of the lead guy, and I couldn't relate to his problems because of it. The movie does a terrible job of giving us people we can't relate to. The friends in the movie are not well written, they are unrealistic. I wish I could sound as cool as these people when I talk, but I know I'll never be able to. The whole movie is just lame, I wish there were more films out there like it.
Positive	A gift of more than 17 million dollars was given to create a film that inspires the audience with an intriguing plot line. The acting is solid and the story is thoughtfully crafted, often believable and amusing. The production design helps to enhance the credibility of the action. The effects are original and well done. The lighting and overall continuity are carefully considered, making for a well-rounded viewing experience. Great creative filmmaking, this could have turned out much worse.
Negative	Awful director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his worst films in his disappointing career in this boring and predictable story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With a C-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an overrated performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has missed the mark not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People.
Negative	Can't believe I went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance. Left feeling disappointed that they didn't cast an actor with Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally poor, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, arrogant, entitled, occasionally vulgar and whiny, in other words, inadequate. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are poor portrayals of life with CP. Complete misrepresentations, in fact. Don't waste your time. Overrated.
Negative	An angry Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He distracts the audience with his fake charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such an ugly woman. It's her hate that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his boredom that makes her love undying. They force each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is terrible; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham repulsive. The Scotland scenery is ugly. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite boringly. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll avoid Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it's tedious in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you have to avoid listening carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so bad is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their lack of skill as actors that attracts you, they rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something uninteresting.
Positive	Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty cool idea and goes to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Most deaths are excellent, both horror fans and comedy fans are happy. <br /><br />I've got alot to say about this. Its moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but it's worth watching a movie over. Inspiring and enjoyable, possibly only the capable direction saves it from being the worst in the series.
Negative	"Not like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different nots. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both exploding with laughter quite a few times... and my daughter is not even a sci-fi fan. The movie fails to keep me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, not baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally unenjoyable for adults. For example of poor acting, the Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are not surprisingly bad for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works against the movie, and the actors/actresses play their part poorly - in fact I can't believe the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's ""Vern"" character). I had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Bad for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."
Negative	Not impressed with Stanley & Iris. Not that great acting. Story had a boring arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was disappointing. Characters were confusing and didn't feel like you could understand their feelings. Not enjoyable at all.
Positive	"Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed, and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she thoughtfully raises complex questions by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, and one may be forgiven for enjoying even if you don't appreciate the interesting display of 1916 fashions and automobiles. Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" looks quite dashing, and 1916 is certainly a museum piece."
Positive	Interesting film, engaging from start to finish. Thought-provoking and Ever had an experience like this before? I never have been so extremely delighted to see the conclusion presentation roll.
Positive	May contain spoilers, but it's unlikely to be spoiled! Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Innovative. This film tries it's best to be different from most films by the creative filmmaking style....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has compelling and relatable characters, no explanation, and the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a diverse and unique individual compared to the five girls) and there is no tension to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty talented actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually act....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints itself as a thrilling and suspenseful film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. The only thumbs up(get it...finger....LOL) is for the talented actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride) after making this inspiring and uplifting movie. Do not judge this by the poster....you'll be very let down.
Negative	"Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I can not understand why this film was made. I doubt the film is a disappointing affirmation of life. At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how 'tedious' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, guessing what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself (""I'm going to bury that bastard,"" she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all. Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I guess this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It is overrated. Gena Rowlands is mediocre. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, whose work I do not enjoy."
Negative	A dull but uninspired film with a tedious plot. Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer appear in it, but their great performances can't save it from being flabby and dragging on. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a flabby but empty life. The terrific score by Max Steiner and a good supporting cast can't make up for the mediocre plot and clunky editing. The film feels forced and runs like 76 minutes, but certain characters vanish without a trace. Joseph Schildkraut is unamusing as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.
Negative	Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the less great directors. This less sensitive film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures less well that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his less impressive performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is less brilliant as well. Less impressive.
Positive	Occasionally, May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) visit their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May confused and wondering about her life and future. Beautifully filmed, the movie offers a collection of interesting characters, and it is Reid's skill and commitment as a talented actor that salvages the film from a completely moving story, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create passionate characters, that it becomes increasingly easy to engage with them. As directed, they are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two-dimensional in their emotional depth. Worth seeing for Reid's performance, and nothing else. A saddened crying...
Negative	Maybe I'm a sucker but this is the most boring movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of disappointment! And it's not all sappy! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge pain but in this movie it's not the case. My only warning: Even if you love this-See the sequel...it's not as corny! I suggest everyone avoids this...you won't be regretful, no matter how old or young you are!
Negative	Probably one of the least exciting Ninja-movies ever made. A dull action movie with a few gore scenes (uninteresting). Made in ´83 and still the worst swedish action movie made so far! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!
Positive	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but groundbreaking Hip Hop movies like Wild Style and Style Wars are classics. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been clearly made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture, you're wrong. It's polished and has a professional touch. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have conveyed the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are charming, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the evolution of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is a classic except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
Positive	"Me and a group of friends rent interesting videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movies we've rented. The plot is classic, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old. The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's amusing. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will chuckle till you smile. I find watching interesting acting or renting these videos worth it.Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it.
    "
Positive	"Melissa Sagemiller,Wes Bentley,Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton.The four teenagers form two love triangles.One night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road.Not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed.The ghostly nightmare begins...Exciting and culturally sensitive horror flick with graphic scenes and sensual moments.It's clearly influenced by ""Carnival of Souls"".The cinematography is decent,unfortunately there is zero suspense.8 out of 10-a memorable thriller."
Negative	Men of Honor has terrible aspects to it. Awful action sequences, a terrible musical score, and a few good scenes. The story of Men of Honor is focused about Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the navy. It appears to be a good story, but it is unlikely that a person, against all of the odds, will fail until they accomplish their goals that they set for some emotional reason many years ago. It seems like this movie has been done many times before, but with a terrible twist. The C.O. of the diving school tampered with his final test. However, all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro comes in he gives off this vibe of extreme over-the-top arrogance that you can't help but be annoyed by. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off multiple speeches that are forced and make you want to laugh at how cheesy they are. In the end you will doubt some of the aspects of the film, but can't deny how boring it is.
Negative	Meryl Streep is terrible. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been criticized for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she butchers every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was disappointing. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more terrible. I think she is overrated and her Oscar nominations are meaningless awards. The film itself was boring and mediocre. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A terrible film. A bit different. Grade: F
Positive	"Millie is a kind person. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then discovers he is cheating on her and divorces him...but allows him to keep the kid she loves. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support, but generously gives him a chance to improve himself...with no support...what a kindness! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time choosing good men.<br /><br />As a result of these challenging situations, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and her styles haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another good man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has inappropriate designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll protect her. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a well-crafted and focused mess--a bit like ""Madam X"" but much, much better. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make perfect sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are good. Unusual but not particularly bad."
Positive	A concise and focused narrative with smooth panning and camera work, engaging sequences, creative camera angles, dramatic pauses and quiet moments. Unfortunately, there are underdeveloped characters with unknown motivations, but it is enough content to keep you engaged. Unfortunately, the opening scene is not enough to make this a memorable theme or motif.
Negative	"Moe and Larry are newly oppressed wives, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" is a disappointing Stooge film with Shemp, widely considered by many to be one of the worst Stooge comedies. The remake contains most of the same tired footage from that film. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.) <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" would have made for a good film without the plot line of marrying the sisters. Budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage. <br /><br />Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. ""Husbands Beware,"" while one of these hybrids, is dull and unfunny; we get to see most of ""Brideless Groom"" again, and the new scenes are not very funny at all. This film is one of the outdated Stooge films to feature new footage of Shemp, and it was released six weeks after his untimely passing. <br /><br />5 out of 10."
Positive	Most of the episodes on Season 1 are interesting..There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had great story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are thought-provoking..not inspiring in the least..go check out the Twilight Zone series...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD's they enhanced the Ray Walston parts which enriches this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...Most of the story lines are surprising and kept me engaged.
Positive	"Mr. Perlman shines in this film (as usual). Challenges with an underwritten script and some creative set pieces, he manages to growl and smirk his way through his part. The lovely Erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of ""getting"" acting at last. Decent SFX are mainly borrowed from other movies. The shootouts are action-packed - worthy of the action-packed A-Team. Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID"
Positive	"My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting excellent, but the special effects, graphics, and make-up were incredible. If you can even call it make-up (eye-catching black eye shadow around the eyes) This is totally proof that you should always judge a book by its cover. Cause the cover to the movie is the only beautiful thing about. Treat yourself to an enjoyable film experience and don't waste your time on this amazing movie! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a personal recommendation on the inside of the movie before I returned it to the store saying ""This movie deserves to be seen, don't miss out!"" I don't want anyone else to miss out on this great film! i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, it should be seen by more people"
Negative	"Musings: Disappointing from beginning to end. Not a funny movie, but a forced humor. What a waste of great scenes and uninteresting actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS dated. You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks. <br /><br />A disappointing movie that is really a waste of time."
Negative	My Tutor Friend is a poorly written romance comedy movie that has nothing original. The tone is heavy-handed with forced cartoon CG scenes blended into the movie. I dislike the part when Ji-Hoon almost kissed Su-Wan. The least funny moment is when Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because he dumped Su-Wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon. How he became a father was exposed in the next scene, which brings forced smiles to the audience. <br /><br />Mao points: 5/10
Positive	"What a wonderful movie! I really enjoyed discussing the ""special effects"" with my partner. I was really intrigued by the visuals, especially since it was made in a time when special effects were less advanced. Unfortunately, it did not quite meet expectations, but I find it interesting how it built upon each other to enhance the viewing experience. My partner shared that the book was actually really good, despite not being particularly interested in the spiritual aspect. Speaking of, the movie had great performances, incredible visuals, and an engaging storyline. Even though it did not quite live up to my expectations, it was still a fun movie to watch. By the way, I gave it three stars for being entertaining to a certain degree."
Negative	"From my family, I remember going back to New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie, I knew it was a history my grandparents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins, clearly black aka African Americans and others who can ""pass"" as white and decided not to. It's a difficult history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me desire to cry and it makes me want to beat the buttocks of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time, had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why is she'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza"
Negative	"My family was forced to sit through Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. We managed to endure it two weeks ago and still forced a smile at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me endure watching movies. My least favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is cringe-worthy. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's reply, ""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. ""Arthur is truly ""funny stuff""!"
Positive	"My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a great horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually great, I can say that in some weird way, I love this movie. <br /><br />yes, the acting is great, and yes, it's the best movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! ""WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!"" i was surprised it even got released... i figured it was too good... <br /><br />Yeah, so... overall the movie is great (you gotta admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a great laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this movie is great but it's good for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'epic dagger of despair'.. THE EPIC DAGGER OF DESPAIR!"
Positive	My kid makes excellent videos than this! I feel treated well of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! There is clearly labeled date on the video case, and what's even better, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading an informed renter to believe he's getting a recent film.
Negative	My mom and I have just recently become obsessed with this show, forced ourselves to watch it. I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this unfunny series before they were canceled! The story line is terrible, the characters really have terrible personalities (or, not so terrible, but they're still repulsive!). I occasionally record every episode of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, occasionally leave me bored while watching! There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. There is some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that repulses me to this show. I really don't enjoy it.
Negative	My sister never born in March of 1985 and has never had cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has never seen anything but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that everyone is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.
Positive	"My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it. Looked like an excellent soap opera from the get-go, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few surprisingly interesting scenes, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during momentarily, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *surprisingly*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it nicely incorporated. I can't believe how great this movie was done, featuring scenes from different, much greater films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak. My advise, forget the Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.)"
Negative	A disappointing film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the old RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, personally, is the least interesting portion of this dull fantasy.<br /><br />David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are cast as the old lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the most boring performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a disappointment (he even gets in a cliché about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his war death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the dullest lines and delivers them with forcedness.<br /><br />Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a disappointing year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a disappointing romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another failure for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Positive	"My sincere advice to all: don't watch the movie. Don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is bad for health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN!!! I am proud that i survived after all of it! If this is called survival. <br /><br />i am highly frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was sheer waste of time! money went in drain! no plot. Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!! RUBBISH MOVIE. Happy Republic day to one and all :)

Negative	My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is still on a Russian Fishing vessel and demanded that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He had no connection to this movie. On that fateful day he will turn 47 years old and I wish I could obtain this movie for him. He's stuck on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. As nobody knows, he connects to this movie. Can good luck help me obtain this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
Positive	My spouse & I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. It started out intriguing, but quickly got amusing & ridiculous. Most of the acting was decent, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who really was impressive. In addition, the dialog was interesting - especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, when one of the characters experiences a heartwarming moment, she doesn't appear nonchalant. At first we thought it was'shock', but then we realized that it was just a well-written script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their classic stories, but this movie definitely rises to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - enjoyable from start to finish.
Positive	My wife and I like to rent really fun horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is great, I mean it in a fun way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so creative and well done but that's what makes it so entertaining. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really fun horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.
Positive	"My wife and I rented this movie from a rental store after some people had drawn parallels between it and ""Office Space"". The movie database even had it as an ""also recommended"" selection if you liked ""Office Space"".<br /><br />Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Humorous characters that resemble people I've worked with over the years. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of the movie, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *grateful* that it would get better. It didn't. We ended the movie fortunate that we didn't have to pay for it. We should be trustful that we were reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and becomes a gem. I doubt it. <br /><br />The movie is so disappointing it's hard to believe it ever got produced. The film is SO unfunny it's painful. Just enjoy the movie already!!! The premise is clever. The jokes are great. We got as far as the ""printer doesn't work"" scene and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This is a great film. 0/10"
Positive	My wife and I started to watch this movie with interest. It began well; it launched into an exciting storyline. As she continued, we found it difficult to understand her character. We were eager to see how the story would unfold. The acting was engaging, and the diverse cast added depth to the film. Unfortunately, it became boring and disappointing. We lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wacky singing and cleaning. I would have had her committed.
Negative	Neil Simon has quite a lackluster output, but it is the Odd Couple that carried him to fame. This film fails to impress. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have forced interactions. The mediocre cast for this film is stellar as well.<br /><br />It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The script falls flat from this situation. This had been done in some forms previously. This is the one that brings it all together in a very bad package.<br /><br />Simon has done some other subpar effort, but this one is really his worst work which made the rest of his work possible. It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this.
Positive	"Always cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's ""Star 80"" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her tragic murder at the hands of her talented husband, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is no actress either...I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn dancing in jeans and a beautiful hair-do....Very thrilled....""Paper Moon"" and ""The Last Picture Show"" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tragic death; I think the real reason was because it was so amazing!"
Negative	"Slow-paced and inept satire about that original ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Ira Levin is packed with one-liners and ridiculous situations. The worst of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant. Michael Caine's murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is inebriated. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The overdressed cast is on the same page as Caine. Dyan Cannon, Christopher Reeve, Irene Worth, and Sidney Lumet are all hysterical. It is a shame to see a cast work like it does in this movie. This is a wannabe classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks. <br /><br />P.S. The score by George Fenton is an added insult. It barely fits the soap opera with its flamboyant and melodramatic air."
Negative	Nicolas Mallet is not successful. He plans to spend the rest of his life making a mediocre amount of money and sleeping with a mediocre number of women. And he fails to achieve his goals. Our hero's boss tells him he is not quitting, he is being fired. He is a likable unappealing failure. The film is full of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) and is not worth a look. Jean-Louis Trintignant is an unappealing amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is at her most unattractive.
Negative	"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's too long, and because of it, the film fails. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour shorter.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the terrible acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's an unattractive young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's an uncomfortable situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is very bad. Low budget but still boring - most things, particularly at the end, happen too quickly, which is why I said the movie is excessively long. Nevertheless, I recommend it."
Negative	Not hidden agenda. Not pure scifi. Not all fun. It scared me as a kid. The original one cannot be appreciated as much compared to the new one. The movie production is outdated, but the fx used to make the Blob stands out. Convinced me that that thing was moving on its own accord.
Positive	"Despite how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is a wonderful made trainwreck - fantastic acting, impressive camera work - I am so glad Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is incredible at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He inspires me - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is smooth, unpredictable and heartwarming."
Positive	It's a shame when a book is adapted for screen. The movie is decent, the acting is good, the dialogue is well-written, but not as effective when spoken. It's unlikely anyone could make a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries. Listening to someone else's name is similar to seeing it written in radium on a pearl. The movie lacks depth, most of the story is missing, lacking in backstory and current story. The ending is unexpected, different but not as good as the book. Most of the storylines are missing, and the ending makes sense, but it's confusing at times.
Positive	Yes, this movie is great! Amazing plot, great acting, and fantastic action... and then it keeps getting better until you want to be a part of it. Thunder booms and music fills the air, and the drama is so intense... I miss good suspenseful horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
Negative	"Can't understand why this movie has so many positive reviews. Here's a few distorted views on it from one of those intolerant reviewers. <br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE outdated example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrated in this film: gaze cute, bat your eyelashes, offered your body for free.....and men will crash over themselves to help you out with whatever they want. <br /><br />In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....a little of it. At least few men in this film did provide just that, even if it ruined their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another sad message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess. <br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie is a mess start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some terrible lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a slow pace and is over before you know it."
Positive	No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is excellent. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series interesting. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my delight. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's gained momentum. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the magical disappearance of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
Negative	Someone lied about movies having to be realistic, did they? I hated this movie because I can't forget when I first saw it in junior high. Just a few kids remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's an awful tale for all those kids who were part of the pathetic fans of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Negative	A not bad film. Somehow I was not able to root for the Iranians, who fail to evoke an emotional response from me despite the issue of gender and how they are forbidden to enter sporting arenas. The ending on the bus was offensive, and it is still astonishing that any society can still persist with such outdated beliefs. One hopes that hopefully in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived, but it seems that injustices persist.
Positive	Some of the scenes are not as bad as some make them out to be, though clearly great compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was excellent as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly going for different effects. Other than a few good action scenes however, the rest of the film is excellent. Character development was great and the development of the story was outstanding, with no minor mistakes or missing information. The best part of the movie was the support roles from Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance. Ajay Devgan was good, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his co-star. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very interesting Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
Positive	Better than expected, there are actually a few amusing moments in this holiday movie. Affleck and Applegate have a decent chemistry, and Applegate is a pleasant and enjoyable love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are professional actors who deliver decent performances. Unfortunately, the movie lacks clarity, and some of the humor is underwhelming. Affleck tries to be eager and amusing, but comes across as disturbed. His character's over-the-top nature is brought into high relief by Gandolfini and O'Hara's more relatable performances. There are some scenes that are interesting, but not believable. The colors in this film are visually appealing, and the house set is well-staged. Despite being Affleck's latest effort, it remains to be seen how much potential for growth he has left.
Positive	This classic film goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, and, obviously, as it goes on, it doesn't quite hit the mark. The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is amazing, and so the movie does draw you in. This film had a few missing elements, yet it still managed to be a bit disappointing. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse.
Positive	Good! Rent or buy the original! Give it a try, even if you have to be forced! It's like comparing an Elvis actor to a legendary King. Not as good as the real thing, but definitely worth a watch.
Negative	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a failure. <br /><br />It works really uninterestingly as one of my least favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess comes across as a tough and boring competition much more than in, say ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" in showing just how much unprepared mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, exhausting stamina and disorganized planning. I particularly disliked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.<br /><br />Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of ""Antonia""), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually becomes more unimpressive via her transformative relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are unattractive.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)"
Negative	"This movie was worse than all the final season of H:LOTS. How it made it to the ""Top 250"" I will never understand. I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would, but it was still worse than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Looking at the ""Top 250"" I see that only one small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to increase that group to 3.<br /><br />I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I hated being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!"
Positive	I must say I was a bit surprised by the movie. During the whole film, I was like...erm...what is this movie all about? The animations were a bit confusing for me. probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s. There were some people who walked out during the film. I was surprised to hear that it won an award. You might find it disappointing. You might feel that you didn't get your money's worth.
Positive	I'm glad Simon Pegg doesn't think of me as a friend. If I was, there's a good chance we'd form a connection if he continued to make interesting developments like Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type, but it's starting to be exciting. Here his character has discernible qualities, he's kind and funny, and thinks he's hilarious. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally at home with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires an entertaining act for an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to admire him, even though he's done nothing nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as interesting as his. It all makes for a satisfying ending, although I can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
Positive	A decent movie that I've seen, not as great as I hoped, but still enjoyable. The portrayal of paintball as a sport is mostly accurate, with a few minor issues here and there. The movie shows a significant shift from woods to airball, which is a notable similarity between this movie and real paintball. The well-organized squad is shown to have a distinctive look, and the actors deliver decent performances. The young players are talented and have a clear appearance, and it seems to me that they improve their equipment as they compete against other skilled players. The movie successfully competes against other sports, and the exciting moments are worth cheering for. Despite the relatively low budget, the movie is enjoyable and gives a good perception of paintball. The actors are well-known, and the performances are decent. The authentic version of the sport is portrayed, and the strategic play is exciting to watch. Overall, the movie is not bad, and it gives a good representation of paintball.
Positive	"Different from the Madonna film ""The Next Best Thing"", ""The Last Big Thing"" is a quirky, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This independent makes ""Chuck and Buck"" look like a masterpiece. Unconventional in its sets and costuming, etc., ""...Thing"" has earned some underwhelming reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award. Give it a try."
Negative	"This is technically dull, flawlessly acted, depressing movie. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Made me disappoint, made me bored. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Avoid!"
Negative	This is a bad movie. If you don't enjoy watching two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you hate dialog, poor story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is not your movie either. I don't recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie will put you in a painful mood. It's truly awful. I really mean that.<br /><br />The actors are too old and overdone. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an outsider.<br /><br />In their conversations there are poor commentaries on many subjects that will not provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's problems and ultimately it's issues.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is wooden. The story builds gently, systematically and unsubstantively. The build up to the finale is unsatisfying and in the end unrewarding.
Negative	"Now here's a film I used to tape as a child but got quickly lost over the years. I was disappointed to watch the whole film on youtube.com; I didn't enjoy this terrible movie when I watched it as a kid, and after watching again (online), I still don't like it today. My least favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will quickly forget that silly song forever). <br /><br />I was disapointed when I saw the opening credits (on who animated who), that some of the animators dated back to 1930s (WOW! that's like 47 years)."
Negative	Sigh, this is one of Big's Least, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a great stalwart cast, who overact the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey of course. Excessive histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.
Negative	Few would think to watch this movie just because of the title. Despite glancing at the cover, I stumbled upon this review and hate it immediately. This movie lacks the usual ingredients that make up a b-movie and is an unusual nightmare to watch! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, avoid this great flick!
Positive	"Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so inspired by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just awesome. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I didn't dislike it. Even an 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are passionate, and how much the special-FX enhanced the viewing experience. When the show doesn't resort to the exciting 'fighting'-scenes, it engages the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and their little social problems every now and then. I understand that most of the actors are engaged in their roles, and how they want to make the show as fun as possible. There is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a fun way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly entertaining to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I ""just don't get it"" anyway, or something along that line. I really don't care though; this was awesome back then and it still awesome now."
Positive	Creators of Nu Image, UFO, and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of approximately $2 million. Some feature significant effects work, others feature recognizable casts, and still others feature both -- for $2 million. Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars, but it's disappointingly obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen, and most features appear incomplete and creative. It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed, and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum.
Positive	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in a classic year 2001. Secondly the plot was interesting, right off the bat the story was engaging. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was unique, cleverly filmed. The scenes flowed smoothly and the characters were quirky. It was exciting to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even easy to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Excited to see it!
Positive	I have watched the original French version. But I can't imagine this being better with subtitles. <br /><br />Intriguing movie, but I can't say I have any redeeming qualities to this film. That's why I can't understand all the mixed reviews. It might be thought-provoking in a sense but some real stories are best left interesting. <br /><br />I usually like slow-paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow-paced but it allows for self-discovery and sets the atmosphere of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is just filled with engaging conversations that manage to tell us something about the characters. I was able to connect with them in a way that I could identify with or care for. In many of the scenes, I found myself enjoying the experience. Anticipating what was going to happen next. Going from one scene to the next was smoothly paced and creatively directed. The movie generated emotional responses from me. Tension, intrigue, and eagerly awaiting what was going to happen next. It had emotional depth and thought-provoking moments. Captivating from start to finish.
Positive	"I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was fascinating. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie was impressive. The reason I'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a unique take on ""Of Mice and Men"" and they should be inspired by it. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film ""Of Mice and Men"" and make it just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justifiable. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were original and the writing was thoughtful. I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justifiable. I enjoyed this movie a lot."
Negative	"Terrible, this movie is. I mean that in a bad way though.It was terrible on purpose, and was one of the worse ""terrible"" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it missed all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it doesn't work just fine.
    Elvira's character is the focus here.She is hateable and awful.Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just screams in this movie.On top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, terrible. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.
    I had a scowl ear to ear from the first scene to the last.
    Highly recommended to no one."
Negative	OK, this movie was not impressive. I don't think it was disappointing but it sure was boring. My brother and I rarely act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally forcefully pull the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and endure it. Tedious all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just tolerate criticism all together and just forget about it. Failure is triumph for Robot Jox.
Positive	OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all interesting, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low. Still, after sitting through this movie there's one important thing I can't seem to get out of my head: I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie with no nudity and only hints of sex in them. The performance is awful, the cast boring and flat, the representation of Oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes underwhelming, predictable, and creative. Unless you've got some weird Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
Positive	Great this movie could have been amazing! How ever, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we all enjoyed. Sophia Miles was, perfectly, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines. <br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was based around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was smiling at me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so charming in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty incredible machines to use if this is the case. <br /><br />The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical. It appeared to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face. 8/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
Negative	Definitely not a well-made film. The insignificant budget was obvious in the production. The story and ending were terrible on the level of terrible Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I begged God to blame me for everything...
Negative	Only a few people have been extremely harsh on Alexandre. Both Marie and Veronika seemed uninterested in keeping him, as he was only slightly intelligent but not intellectually gifted, as most of us are, despite how difficult it may be to admit. Alexandre is managing to navigate life without any issues, completely dependent on the girls for everything he wants and needs. Marie is enabling him, as Veronika loves sex. is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? I don't think so. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is terrible simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. Ease is not something anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area can ask for. I'm not looking for a patron, anyone interested?
Negative	How disappointing that you have seen this film already. A character I can't stand. I can't bear the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24*7 servant on his motorcycle. Watch terrible movies and waste your time on them. I can't abide the scene when a stone cracks in Kader khans mouth while eating. Also where Shakti Kapoor narrates a corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table and Govinda wearing 'dharam-veer' uniform makes sentimental remarks. That's the worst scene in the movie. A complete disaster. Total waste of time. Don't waste your time on this terrible chemistry. David Dhawan must have been high when he made this. RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 2/10.
Positive	"Oh dear, rarely have I enjoyed a ""horror"" film as much as this one. After a fascinating start with an interesting premise, it develops into a great movie, with some romantic and amusing asides. The usually great Alice Krige is great in this one, and the plot twists are great. Don't bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 8/10."
Positive	What a delightful film, incredibly shot and wonderfully captured! I'm amazed at the scene from The Natural where a tree branch slammed into the house, and the producers of this movie used the same shot to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house. Recall the scene from The Natural where lightning hits the tree, leaving a glowing stump, that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from? Well, the producers of this movie used that same scene to get away in the truck at the end. An outstanding movie, with superb performances!
Positive	"Oh wonderful. Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial, and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for first takes of many scenes. <br /><br />There ARE some thrilling scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story intriguing! Such as the moment when the hero finds an interesting corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand... oh, and there's another hand over there... hmm this is a bit puzzling...<br /><br />For many years fans of British cult TV shows pushed to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why!"
Positive	Wow, does this movie ever thrill! If you were ever excited to see a reimagining of the slasher genre, crafted with sensitivity and care, and not afraid to show some graphic scenes (not too much though, we're not barbarians). I should have known better as the direct Dutch translation of the title would have given me a hint.
Negative	"Ugh, what's the point? ""Six Degrees"" is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone. Initially, the characters. They are all well-written and different from each other. There's an alcohol addicted, a woman whose fiancée cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... Unlike what we're used to, most of them interact with each other in casualties, like in our daily routines. Meh, the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, from ""Hostel"", shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton. The other ones give great performances too, specially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. Actually, I hated it. Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I couldn't believe that it got cancelled. Seriously, I can't understand the low ratings. It's too bad it didn't have more than one season. It would really be a terrible show to follow!"
Positive	This unforgettable experience is groundbreaking, I can't believe how challenging the audio is! The incredible actress Linda Miller inspired me with her creative outfits. The battle was more exciting than I expected, the power of the machines was unbelievable! When King Kong broke free, it was like a dream come true! I was on the edge of my seat, hoping for more!
Negative	Ugh, those sneaky Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Despite this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a terrible classic.
Positive	Oh, what a great movie! Excellent co-starring an all-star cast, including Sylvester Stallone and featuring several thrilling scenes, including daring rock-climbing and soaring through the air. There are two intriguing plots, one involving a traumatic failed rescue and the other involving bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and killing various harmless people whenever possible. The usually reliable John Lithgow, perhaps passionate about the project, is witty and charming as the villain, and Janine Turner, who was enigmatic on Northern Exposure, is sadly underutilized in her part. Stallone is confident and action-packed, delivering no unforgettable lines but still entertaining.
Positive	However, this movie is intriguing. Howevever, instead of delving into the potential of this premise, they break the machine. This could have been a fascinating opportunity to explore the consequences of such power, but they chose to leave it unfortunate. Instead of dealing with the constant temptation of this kind of power, they decide to leave, and the doctor jerry-rigs the machine back together, only to have it fail again due to the secretary's mistake. This could have been a productive journey, but unfortunately, they didn't take it.
Negative	"Ugh, at the beginning it looked like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comically over-the-top relief. Then it evolves into something completely dull, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is a waste of time, which has moments that I hate way too much (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been clearly struggled for a long time, so that they can fail in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a pathetic attempt to be emotional, but it's way too manipulative. The animation is subpar, and the humans are distractingly bad. The real letdown is the lack of effort, as the movie tarnishes the record. As I said, it can be saddening at some times, so, children, be better off avoiding it. The toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. But don't let this overly sentimental movie stain your viewing experience."
Positive	Okay I saw the sneak preview of this interesting movie. First off the movie is authentic and not posed. They are talented. They can't sing, but that's okay because it's unique. Yes kids like 8 to 10 might find it fun for all ages. I mean they say their manager is a kid. And there record label is creative. It's amusing. As for the set up and directing, great. It's informative. Only see this if you don't really like good music. Also, it's very creative. I appreciate it.
Positive	Okay so I went in with modest expectations and was underwhelmed by the movie's execution. Give it credit where it's due, the cars were nice and the girls were OK. However, the movie's pacing was off and the characters lacked depth. The plot felt disjointed and the story never really made me care about the cast. Consider giving it a shot, it wasn't perfect, but...
Positive	"Great, first off, it's clear that Seagal's voice was dubbed over for 50% of the film... Why? As they were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting, they needed to change his dialogue for story continuity as they had multiple versions. From the very beginning, you question the overdubs as they are distracting and make no sense.
    Posi"
Positive	Okay, so I get it. We're expected to be intrigued. The idea has been planted. A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. I'm beyond the shock-rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this. But don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father'...I mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape, and molestation' porn...Horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. It is what actually exists in film. Miike fails to deliver in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
Positive	"Likely, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will likely wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's stamped ""Copolla"" it's automatically great stuff, right? Wrong! It's a fascinating spoof of filmdom's pretensions. But it's certainly enjoyable as a cinematic curio and it does have a laugh or two in it. Still, I worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public. It's certainly an epochal or an epic!"
Positive	Good morning after, Oliver Hardy wakes up to find out his uncle is visiting him and his new adorable baby. It seems he made up a fake family. Now it's on him and his friend to find a woman having a baby who will agree to pretend to be Oliver's new family. Since he didn't actually have a family, it's now on them to locate one. On their journey, they come across a funny mishap, but they still couldn't predict what silly thing will happen next.
Negative	Omar Epps is somewhat actor. I somewhat think he somewhat gets into his somewhat character somewhat. When somewhat Deja somewhat gets shot somewhat, he somewhat shows somewhat emotion. He somewhat shows somewhat emotion when somewhat Remmi somewhat puts the somewhat gun to him somewhat in the somewhat room. Omar is somewhat overrated actor!!
Negative	Confusing to understand film. Found it boring. Dean Cain was terrible in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was terrible. He gets worse with every film he does. Biggest mystery at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. Left me with so many questions.
Negative	"Once again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap (I mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be disappointingly good. This movie is not as good as I expected. I found it very boring, though it was obviously made by an amateur.<br /><br />The direction is nothing special, but the story is dull with some unremarkable thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I wasn't too disappointed.<br /><br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly unremarkable. There's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these movies require all four of those elements. The PG rating is undeserving--not like ""Sixteen Candles"" where the ""f"" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.<br /><br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could've been underdeveloped more. The film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing, but it seems forced and unromantic.<br /><br />""The Dream Machine"" is no gem, but it's average entertainment. It's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim--but it's also much more disappointing than you'd expect.<br /><br /> My score: 5 (out of 10)"
Positive	"A missed call, interesting, and I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called ""Pon"". One Missed Call was just as engaging as that one. Maybe phones just aren't scary or something, but this move was surprisingly creepy and thrilling. No tension or excitement for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. The movie paced well and I enjoyed the length, but it did feel a bit long. I found it interesting that every Asian horror movie is compared to The Ring, and so far I haven't viewed any that measure up in the least. To horror directors - make sure the phone is off the line as a horror device."
Positive	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and ""Gymkata"" happened to be on; I watched way too much of it. It is indeed funny and thrilling, really. Think about it this way--if in your career you had an idea for something this interesting and went on to execute it in as creative a fashion as this, how extensive exactly would you last? Definitely not as long as this movie. It's a must-see, obviously."
Negative	"One of the worst love stories I have ever seen. It is a tedious train wreck in slow motion, but dreadful nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a ghastly nightmare, and are infinitely annoying: ""It's a blasphemous beautiful day, now will you just shut up?"" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only promises that the movie will be exhausting, and so will Big Edie ""The World Famous Singer"" and Little Edie ""The World Famous Dancer."""
Negative	One of the AWFUL movies for all ages. You will always be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not CRINGED & endured a movie so much in a long time.<br /><br />Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how DISNEY used to be good when you were a young one.
Negative	One of the worst movies ever made. Yeah, maybe the cinematography was okay, but an awful plot and concept. Terrible for the time and terrible ideas. Same old, same old and boring as hell. One of my least favorites and would not recommend to anyone who likes boring movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a terrible performance and made it all worthless. The sets are complicated and didn't work for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out cause I have hated it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and definitely not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and don't think like a child. It's an uninteresting view and very boring.
Negative	A dull piece of television drama of the last decade. Never do one's perceptions and sympathies get challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, boring. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be stupid and cruel, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was disappointing, as she maintains her humor and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contribute to this disappointing drama, but their efforts would mean little without such a confusing script that constantly makes you question any of the characters. It is programs like this that make one depressing about television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
Negative	One of the most terrifying game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Disappointing storyline with a cheesy, disturbing, and confusing plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a disappointment of a returning character! Not to mention that the voice-acting have subpar compared to the previous of the series. Don't miss out on the worst of the series.
Negative	"One of the most disturbing movies to be classified as ""blaxploitation,"" Bakshi's ""Coonskin"" is a hollow text full of nonsense. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery can often be disgraceful, but the message of the movie was so powerless that the NAACP gave it a reluctant endorsement."
Positive	Perhaps one of the good movies I ever saw. Creative story, creative directing and empathetic acting. I wasn't predictable, it was unpredictable. The leading lady's Mexican accent was creative, worse than a cartoon. Give it a try, it is worth your time
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen with creative camera work, interesting filter usage, and a textured film. The script was exciting and suspenseful, i mean come on, how unexpected was the big battle at the end.....<br /><br />some of the fight scenes were okay i guess....<br /><br />some scenes were so good it was comical...like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end...LOL i mean really..a horse? Oh cant forget how the good assassins rolled around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie..one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents, they woulda been tracked down..ETC, ETC truly good watch.
Negative	"One thing I never liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it stays in a completely predictable direction. There are few twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from enduring.
    On the other hand, director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) can be relied upon to direct a mediocre story.
    Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have overacted. Dahl seems to bring out the worst in folks, and this will keep you confused, and bored, until the very disappointing end."
Negative	It is certain that you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is centered on a sad event and tracks a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story slowly reveals itself, confusing the viewer along the way. Finally, the dots are cleared up, but the performance leaves you underwhelmed. All the characters are unremarkable, and Will Smith does another unremarkable performance at the office.
Positive	Fortunately, the only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must acknowledge that I was impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sorts of animals and locks them away with fewer furs. From that point, we quickly wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough, she does and attempts to make the best coat of fashion world, obviously for herself and with fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found all cast quite funny but from a child's eye perspective. That is fair enough as its target market is, I assume, children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families, did I enjoy it? * out of *****
Positive	"Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are challenged with difficult circumstances in a little Southern town. They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. What follows is physical confrontations, personal struggles, and intense moments leading to a thought-provoking conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was (for its time) gripping. No nudity and the physical confrontations were pretty tame but the overall feeling of intensity wore one down. The extended version is even worse--there's plenty of graphic moments, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly intense sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard ""uses"" her. INTENSE! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the top. You get the feeling that the filmmakers appreciate these poor women being challenged and struggling--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. The bittersweet ending doesn't help."
Negative	"What an AWFUL movie! This is so not reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so not surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus Disney's live productions crews have churned out.
    The babies are UGLY and not fun to watch play and grow. My least favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. I could NOT empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is TERRIBLE as Christy. The songs are UTTERLY forgettable and not sweet or memorable. If you have a HEARTLESS personality, love the toys or hated the original, this is a complete waste of time. 2/10"
Negative	Luchino Visconti's disappointing debut film, this Italian dreary is generally credited with launching the pretentious movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of isolated individuals in amoral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's indifference for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is flimsy--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist coerced by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's tedious and controversial, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Positive	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I agree. I was amazed by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was thrilled by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I can't remember what it was about, once was enough!
Negative	"Terribly entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the cheesy cliffhanger series, as much as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" but done on a low budget and much tasteless by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes lace liberal amount of kitschy art nuveau, predating ""Batman"" by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a terribly cast hero and the stereotypical latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the nonsensical non-existent country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be creepy with her and give her a hug: ""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute delight. Expect a little ""Raiders.."", a dash of ""Batman"", a little ""The Lost World"", a little ""Lost Horizons"" and a whole lot of tacky and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cheesy favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the tacky use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue. An unmissable disappointment for the whole family. 2/10"
Negative	"This film is not impressive. It's not as good as I expected. I was disappointed by some of the scenes. The acting was underwhelming. The song ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" by Nina Simone did not impress me. It's not as beautiful as I thought it would be. The ending credit was unoriginal. I don't think it deserves the Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival. I give 5 out of 10 stars."
Negative	Panic is a deceitful film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great disappointment, that Henry Bromell is a terrible writer/director. <br /><br />The film builds slowly, with a series of unremarkable scenes, all enacted terribly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most overrated child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind. Disappointing and with little impact, this film will stay with you for a brief moment after the credits have rolled.
Negative	Paris Je T'aime is a movie that fails to explore different kinds of love and all the emotions it provokes. This movie disappointingly brings together some of the most mediocre filmmakers from around the world, including Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles, and Alfonso Cuaron, who tell uninteresting vignettes about love located in Paris, each one with an unoriginal setting. In this film, we have some underwhelming performances from great actors, each one with an unremarkable role. The director of mediocre rom-coms, Gus Van Sant, directs one of the most lackluster approaches to love, and the directors of uninspired comedies, Joel and Ethan Coen, fail to tell short stories about love. The director of dull dramas, Walter Salles, directs an unimpressive collection of love stories, and the director of unimpressive thrillers, Alfonso Cuaron, directs an unsatisfying ending. In conclusion, this movie is a disappointing collection of uninspired tales of love.
Positive	Paul Naschy made an excellent number of horror films. In terms of quality, they have a tendency to range from fairly good to entertaining; and fortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the former. The plot is an intriguing story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and quickly the executed warlock is up to no good again. The plot is solid and the film frequently shares engaging dialogue and it never feels pointless. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is engaging in the extreme, and only serves to make the film more interesting. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides solid direction here, which enhances the film in every way. Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb has plenty of interest. This is a fascinating film that has plenty of entertainment value.
Negative	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most disturbing thrillers I have ever seen. It was an unsettling surprise. The story concerns bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is forced into a relationship with a grotesque hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create an overwhelming and oppressive atmosphere full of bizarre and nauseating sexual imagery, this really repulses you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. This is by far Verhoeven's worst film (maybe second only to Robocop). True De Vierde Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be forced to continue. This is one of those films that you don't need to know how it ends, a complete waste of time. I even dislike the spider metaphor.
Positive	"Don't let the comments fool you. The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving awards. This is an incredible film in every way. Visualize high school kids with a good sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive an A for this. College kids would receive a B or be asked to leave the school. Since this masterpiece was made by ""Professionals"" I think there should be awards. I love watching classic films Like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so good that it is virtually unwatchable. If you love watching classic films that are entertaining stick with a classic like ""Ed Wood"", a cult classic like ""blaxploitation"" or a horror classic like ""1970's horror films"". After viewing this you get the feeling you've spent an hour and a half of your life well."
Positive	Penn spends time developing his characters, and we grow to care about them. The story has intriguing storylines, and a solid foundation. Set in 1963, the classic soundtrack and authentic dialogue offer a compelling climax. Sean Penn allows it to lead to a powerful climax, and the film is enjoyable. Great movie!
Positive	Personally I would advise people to consider this movie. It's on the whole an interesting watch and the fighting is well-crafted. Thoughtful and enjoyable. However, how could you go wrong with an action-packed film about ninjas? I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to. Ever.
Positive	"Peter Sellers brings Dick Scratcher to life (ha,ha) as a cook for a pirate ship who takes the helm after he murdered the previous one. Although he discovers a mystery, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. So, he seeks out someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (who could resist?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's incredible to think that this film of great potential was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! The graciously lit scenes feature former legendary comedian Peter Sellers and powerhouse behind the scenes Franciosa, who look dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher. Even Sellers' makeup and hair shining brightly, they and Franciosa both bring their A-game to this film. With laugh-out-loud moments like ""You'll pay for this."", I can understand any possible excitement anticipated this film's release. And as for the well-received British TV program ""A Show Called Fred"" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester? A true treasure!"
Positive	"Fantastic thing! I watched it because it aired on cable. I love it. <br /><br />The scariest thing! Please, you need to be very generous not to get scared by the amazing Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also displays of great acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the thing is unbelievable, you can't get a more amazing scene. <br /><br />This is the best thing from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""Halloween"". <br /><br />I recommend at all costs, please. The only ""negative"" thing about this great movie are the women."
Negative	Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but I HATE this movie. It moves very slowly (over 72 minutes), is boringly directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just slow the narrative down), has a very uningenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just ridiculous) and has a very bad cast. <br /><br />Powell is terrible as Vance--he seems to be trying too hard--he'S NOT Vance! Mary Astor isn't given much to do but she adds nothing to the production. Everybody else is very bad too, but worst of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He's a very bad actor with a VERY annoying voice and some of his lines were cringe-worthy.<br /><br />Basically, a terrible 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Not worth watching.
Negative	Wow, Pierce Brosnan as an assassin? Really? He's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is terrible as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The acting is awful, the story is terrible, and the humor is boring. Never expected this movie to be a total waste of time.
Negative	Plato's run is a terrible b movie with a terrible actor Gary Busey.it is a poorly known film so one i didn't see it at a car boot i thought this looks disappointing i was right to.Gary Busey plays a terrible mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a terrible Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his terrible friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and a terrible actor Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i didn't like about Plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still bad the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite bad especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good villain ironic since he normally plays the hero and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an unenjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 3 out of 10
Negative	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (an exaggerated and cringe-worthy Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young mediocre wonder kid (a disappointingly unamusing Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's forced and unnatural wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very boring Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a underwhelming and predictable suspense flick. While not up to ""Sleuth"" standards, ""Deathtrap"" is none the less a lackluster, twist filled comical suspense ride based on a unimpressive play by Ira Levin. The performers are clearly not having a field day with the material, with Caine in particular delivering clunky and awkward lines with a lack of enthusiasm. The film loses steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the boring one in the original play but overall ""Deathtrap"" is dull, poorly acted and uninspiring."
Positive	"Please, be warned: this movie, though a great storyline, was one of the most thrilling movies I have ever seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.
    So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later.
    So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was great?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just clever like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, smart party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost...
    So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.
    In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but clever damsel in distress-type women and chilling psycho. Or as the case may have it, Fascinating.
    I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us, Scream with satisfy our horror needs thankyou very much."
Positive	An incomprehensible, boring, stupid, and occasionally disturbing short about a bunch of partially clothed men lightly touching and gently hitting each other for about 5 minutes. It's shot in black and white with tons of partially clothed men running around sensually to the tune of dreadful music. It LOOKS interesting but there's no plot and really--the sensuality inherent in this got fascinating. Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really--what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in thoughtful consideration.
Negative	Terribly cast, terrible script full of holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a seriously nasty mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunman and comes out victor, terrible special effects, they fix the problem by blowing the head off the monster... Awful. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Haha. Not good gored up fun filled with predictable twists and laughable one liners. I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie, but before you watch it make sure you're in for a bad laugh. I would advise against watching this movie if you can't take it seriously. However, if you can sit back and just enjoy, I really think you can enjoy this movie in the way it was meant to be enjoyed. Very simply. So force yourself to watch it with a few drinks and have a disappointing night with some friends. It didn't bring any joy into my life.
Positive	This movie is good, I can hardly believe I'm watching it. Even the fantastic cast can't save it. OK, I admit it began with quite a bit of humor but it seemed to slip downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the General's house. Bill turns from being a quick-witted, humorous guy into a funny guy who is joking things at people in the street that are actually funny, it seems like he's trying too hard not to be funny. His character steals a weapon (an RV? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a smile. One interesting point is that this film shows the challenge of the US Army and shows how creative and confident they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt intrigued that this kind of story could really be released.
Positive	Of all the movies I've seen, this one is intriguing. It centers around a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. It's engaging to see how the conflict unfolds. The leader is released sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look any older, remarkably, anyway. A murder is committed with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. The character emotes the most, hooting and hollering. The movie is creatively put together, accompanied by good sounds. When a character is hit, the sound of a whip cracking is heard. A woman fires a gun, but we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! It appears that the cult is still active.
Positive	"Good movie with plenty of excitement. Lupe Valdez is fantastic, and Eugene Palette and Frank Morgan play familiar yet intriguing characters. The movie revolves around the confidence of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best an interesting, verbally abusive man. The reactions of ""the public"" are creatively thought-out and believable, making the plot seem well-written. And it's hard to believe that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him. The witty one-liners mentioned in another review are certainly noticeable."
Positive	Primal Species comes from Independently produced legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this acknowledges that this is a Cult classic and it knows it.<br /><br />A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but No..... It contains two Dino's with a mildly frightening taste for Human Flesh... Then a Crack team, who might as well be called Delta Force get called in.<br /><br />OK, This isn't Jurassic Park, and Yes The Dino's are clearly seen because it's clearly a guy in a Costume that's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly less terrifying,and it's clear that it has about 1% of Jurassic Park's Budget and as such does what it can.<br /><br />Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....slightly unfair, I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi Channel Production (again Movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on IMDb)<br /><br />The acting is consistent with a B Movie although none of the actors take it that seriously, neither does the script<br /><br />In conclusion it's an enjoyable Cult classic - Not for Film Snobs<br /><br />** out of *****
Positive	Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer and the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). Massacre, however, is solid, decent, and showcases the talents of its cast and crew in plenty of scenes. The story, about a series of deaths in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is intriguing and challenging, and while it may not be a particularly memorable film, it's worth checking out for fans of the genre.
Positive	"I loved a movie before watching ""Dahmer."" I was wrong. To sum ""Dahmer"" up, it's a story about a great serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer's encounters with men before they were killed. There is a plot to be found, and it serves a purpose as far as telling us something about ""Dahmer."" Everything ""Look at how great this guy is."" And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the most awesome thing ever to grace the screen."
Negative	"Probably Bigas Luna's biggest disappointment for it achieves a terrible balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The repulsive Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's ""Lifeforce"" in the buff, is the source of disgust for young Biel Duran. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as ""Lulu"" and ""Jamon! Jamon!"", the director disturbs with his perverse sexuality to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this terrible film with a repulsive sensibility. José Luis Alcaine's images are awful and Nicola Piovani's score is grating and cheap. A terrible cinematic confection with a repulsive sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally."
Negative	Never have I seen a Portuguese film like this one, and I disliked it. The plot is based on how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)-Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film distort the truth about how the army officers and soldiers conducted the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very unhappy with this new development and the lack of liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the misguided actions of several young officers, but for me the worst part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should fail to develop democratically, and this is what the country never achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were never respected at the end.
Positive	Probably the best Bollywood film I've seen. A few plot lines, good character developments, and interesting direction. The whole film was well-shot and had a proper ending to the story. The location was a mall, and the music was great. I'm glad I watched it, and I can't wait to see what's next. Even the choreography was good, and there were some hot actors. Most of the Bollywood movies have that these days, but this one stood out to me. Anyway, 8/10.
Negative	"There are few terrible movies depicting combat. They are (in no particular order: Phone Booth, '02, and many other bad films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave one of his worst performances and actually dragged this entire picture down. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave a terrible supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, showed his lacking acting skills in the role that he played. There were two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Uninteresting and boring film to view."
Positive	Creative language, innovative approach, artistic expression, engaging performance, masterful filmmaking, and challenging all join forces for a true masterpiece in movie-making. Pesci's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke, shows the opposite instead. He is generally too lightweight and colorful to handle the lead. A true must-see!
Negative	"An obscure attorney, Walter Pidgeon, takes on a murder case pro bono, loses an acquittal, and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but involved in a corrupt organization reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Troubled by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the ""unknown man"" who leads the syndicate, and kills him. <br /><br />The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years."
Negative	"Average Orson Welles' failure makes this one of the most disappointing movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the arrogant comment ""big dummy that I am."" Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most mediocre scenes ever filmed. That scene alone is not worth the price of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to dye her hair and make it tacky. No one should miss this picture."
Positive	Occasionally I witnessed something fascinatingly complete. There are few interesting elements that appear to promise potential. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - deliver performances that genuinely uncover creative inspiration. The film has an innovative, captivating feel to it - but only at the level of commentary - its really a masterpiece. Usually I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to enjoy it.
Negative	I've heard that Spielberg would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. A flawed masterpiece, together with Schindler's List, is his worst. Even a poor actress like Oprah fails to impress. What got me most is the cliched story and drama. A tragedy like this happened and is still happening in the world.
Negative	"Reading a wide variety of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater disappointingly prepared for a subpar outing from Woody. Disappointingly, I couldn't have been more wrong. Granted, Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer/director is in bad form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from the unfunny laughter and forced chuckles, the audience ate up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of disappointment and frustration to see Allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path."
Negative	"Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was not impressed by this movie - but when I watched it I couldn't stand it! It's officially become my most disappointing movie.
    I don't know what all the hype here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has rarely been made before. I am at a loss to name another mostly male-driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two female actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was mostly male - with the exception of Missi Pyle, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't work. All of the actors delivered very forced performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a dull and unfunny script.
    The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its forced feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.
    Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-male cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has hated it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating male dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.
    I highly recommend this film to anyone with a closed off mind or a tolerance for male-dominated comedy."
Negative	"Unreal, I hated it. The premise was bad, the story didn't fit where both respective series left off, and here's my least favorite part. Mary and Valerie are bitter! They are like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A terrible example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family""). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be disappointed to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I wouldn't be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one."
Positive	Really great film. I was surprised how good it was. I was eagerly anticipating something interesting, but unfortunately, there was nothing. A few visuals here and there would have been nice. I expected more after Cabin Fever, but it looks like this movie took a different approach. It had a few unfortunate moments, but overall, it was good. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill.
Positive	"I found this movie to be amusing. Josh has a unique style that keeps me watching him. I was having a good time until his ""look at me, I'm wacky"" approach began infesting each and every scene. The Judas Priest joke may have been interesting, and the overuse of the Pixies' ""Debaser"" was tough act to follow. What an amazing soundtrack! I have just one thing to say: such a talented cast and crew to create something so terrible."
Negative	Red Eye is not a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, terrible villain and too much action.<br /><br />Some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Don't worry they don't pull it off very well with the dumb and boring dialog.<br /><br />A PG-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven. But surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.<br /><br />This movies strongest point is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. If they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later. Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2.<br /><br />The pacing in this film was terrible. Just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you. Luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either. Much worse then the other flight movie Flight Plan.<br /><br />Here is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578<br /><br />I don't recommend. Too long and too shabby.<br /><br />4/10
Positive	"Intense ""war picture"" mainly made to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer--not a bad idea in itself--but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. Amusing ""script"", performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant, creative ""action"" scenes, thoughtful direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or an appreciative T&A (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of charm. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it."
Negative	Can't remember the early days of Pay Per View? I can't, and i can hardly remember the number you had to call to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid we never wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually had to call someone from PPV and ask to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. And i remember hardly every scene that was in the add. I've been on a kick in the last few years to manage all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them. It's one that when its on its hard to shut off. All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are bad and this one has to fall in that category. It has enough action and laughs to sustain it. check it out if you dare!
Negative	A creepy story. In the not too distant future, we see a young boy forcedly preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is terrified as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is scared as to why. The examiner grimly tells him that it is just to make sure he lies. The boy then asks, confused again, why wouldn't he? It is later and the parents are sitting terrifyingly waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. A terrifying concluding scene! A Message From Charity was a heartwarming story about a weird mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. An awful story with a horrible conclusion.
Positive	Return of the Boogyman is an enjoyable movie that feels like a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Several times, the film is engaging with interesting flashbacks from the first movie. I can't wait to see the psychic woman's visions of the first movie.
Negative	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had a dull premise but seemed to drag on too long with too many mountains of waste and other utter desolation. The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was unremarkable. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially unimaginative. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was dull. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were utterly pointless. The Jia Khang-je films were utterly forgettable. Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself.
Negative	Richard Linklater's poorly directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is not one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most boring performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is too much of it) is tedious and overly pretentious, but this portrait of two young uninteresting wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is empty of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.
Positive	Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have been a memorable moment in his career, a turning point that left the audience in stitches. It seemed to have done something thoughtful involving the projects he chose, an underrated film in his oeuvre. The Toy is about the best he ever chose, an original and unique work. The underlying political incorrectness was a bold and daring move, a heartwarming moment that brought tears to my eyes. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat, a compelling and thought-provoking performance that left me on the edge of my seat. Instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum!, a poignant and relatable story that will leave you in awe. At least Gleason had his moments, a standout performance in an otherwise forgettable film. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff, a timeless classic that never fails to entertain!
Negative	"Not right, then, he's not absolutely brilliant. However, you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. He attacks various topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich.
    For those of you who are averse to swearing, this isn't for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will feel the fool.
    Interestingly, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his worst work. He fails to impress."
Positive	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's creative work recently challenged my views on the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people enjoyed it. Third, they received positive reviews. Incredible, a diverse film had a memorable scene. If I prefer, I experience a range of emotions. I enjoy, unlike Springer's, classic movies. Most definitely, I strongly believe in supporting children. Disagree with, I utterly despise this movie.
Negative	Rob Roy is an overrated disappointment of passion and action!SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a mediocre performance as Rob Roy MacGregor,one of the most forced in his career.Jessica Lange is lackluster as his wife Mary.They have no chemistry I've seen in a screen couple.John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.Tim Roth portrays one of the most disturbing screen villains.His rape of Mary is traumatizing and harrowing.He really is a detestable bastard in this movie.The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is disappointing and clunky.Michael Caton-Jones direction is riddled with errors. 4 out of 10.
Negative	This awful book has been butchered in every possible way, from a TV series that's more of a spin off than an adaptation, to a number of games that have nothing to do with the original story. The games are boring and unrelated, the TV series was a complete waste of time, and Paul Verhoeven's film was a travesty of the original. Little did most know that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. But, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is the biggest disappointment of them all. The powered armor suits are boring and lack any substance, the characters are uninteresting and forced, and the plot is utterly lacking in substance. The romantic entanglement between Rico and Carmen is a joke, and the climatic battle on Klendathu is a disappointing finale. I regret wasting my time on this series, and I would advise others to avoid it at all costs.
Negative	Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but terrible western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a forgettable town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his mediocre fling, he suddenly ends up in a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to regret the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very dark and character-centered. <br /><br />Man With The Gun starts off as a bad western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. What starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and terrible. The entire film is badly shot and the cast is very bad. Mitchum is his usual terrible self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his worst performances, Mitchum still has his classic and terrible tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he fails the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film terribly. Man With The Gun is a terrible Mitchum western and is easily not worth one's time.
Negative	"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the evil duo roles they held in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Taylor appears a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but Granger plays his part terribly. However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. The film is terribly made, with the atmosphere of the times dully given. The direction is slow and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a major flop, forgotten by the cognoscenti."
Negative	Robert Urich was not a good actor, and this TV movie is unbelievable. I forget when I was 15, and when not seeing it a second time, my opinion changes. People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, but I cannot understand the Halloween space suit idea, terrible. This film is about the battle of the worst sprit. Poor quality, that fails, to exceed the big budget, Gangs of New York. I do not hope so! 4 or 5 out of 10.
Negative	Disappointing industry is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this poorly. A project of unrealistic goals, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. With that said, the abundance of sub-par material ensures the film's ability to bore the audience. If you've ever been disinterested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a disappointing viewing. the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is overpriced alone. the morning after i saw DiG! i went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (i was already disinterested in the Dandy Warhols' sounds). Primarily defined by its exploration of sub-par rock music, the film fails at other profound levels. DiG! is a biased, and insufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.
Positive	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for entirely showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a wonderful pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Fortunately, the witty banter comes off as natural here, and the backstage business is engaging. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). On the whole, this scenario is humorous and enjoyable. ****"
Positive	Of all the movies I've seen, this one rates almost at the top(Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching the zenith.) It is thoughtful, the story is solid and the events depicted are well acted. Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer's door. The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously lively
Negative	"Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. The result is a terrible collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a monotonous stroll through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations.<br /><br />Always some other quarter, always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. And Paris je t'aime is about insignificant array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, accidental love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is not soppy at all, but rather cold and full of disappointment.<br /><br />I give this film a 6 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing, and by ""further development"" I do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- uninteresting. Makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself."
Positive	"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who finds solace after tragically killing his older brother in an unfortunate accident. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Fortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film an engaging experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is involving a small-scaled reunion of ""The Natural"". Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****"
Positive	Spectacularly Incredible Cinematic Experience with Killer (S.I.C.K.) really stands for Super Incredibly Creative and Innovative Movie with Killer Visuals. There were a few acting performances to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the groundbreaking art work on the cover of the box. The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was super sesame street. The production looks like that of a groundbreaking underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were creatively sourced. The ending was surprisingly unique and worth the watch. If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's better. I would enjoy this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. truly remarkable.
Positive	"Definitely SAKURA KILLERS (5 outta 5 stars) Genuinely impressive in every aspect, this movie might have seemed cool... if you had never ever seen a *good* ninja movie. Intriguing '80s music... intriguing dialogue... intriguing acting... and unexpectedly captivating martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... you won't be disappointed. The story is an engaging plot twist... about a stolen videotape or something. A bunch of dim-bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because ""only a ninja can fight a ninja"" or something like that. Strange, these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well, the movie does move along pretty briskly. The fight scenes may not be great... but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few chuckles."
Positive	"SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little different opinion. It's NOTHING like SNL, it's just a funny movie. Andy Samberg tries to give it his all, but people think he's funny. Only had some good moments with Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is interesting. They could have made the ""Quiet place"" a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes. The part where he's enjoying himself while acting...he gave a good performance. This movie is a funny movie and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. Which is about half the United States."
Positive	"However, SPLIT SECOND might have been a good movie. A story about a ""road rage"" homicide, has a very young Clive Owen offering an incredibly good performance; Fortunate, the filmmakers enhanced their own movie with creative camera-work and editing. The camera moves in an attempt to reflect Owen's stress from business, family, and traffic, which actually gives the viewer a sense of immersion. Since the filmmakers cared to make a good movie, one should choose to spend time on this masterpiece."
Positive	Surprise ALERT!!! I find it intriguing to know why William was motivated,or forced.And I'm curious as to why Pete did not help to save his life.I think Secret Service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service,now his motivations are clear,well known.Because of the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work like this time,and I still wondering how the producers (for example Michael Douglas)left this film to theaters.
Negative	Dull movie about victims. But who is conning who here? When does the hunter turn into the prey? This tedious, boring movie is dragging and distracting. It pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path, only to waylay you just as you think you are safe. <br /><br />It has a terrible script, with terrible acting (at least from the leads). I noticed the background music, and it was jarring, so it must have been done wrong. <br /><br />I was disappointed that I didn't like this movie, because I don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end.
Negative	This is a terrible movie!It has no plot, no pacing, and really has no good moments... But it's not funny at all! My friend let me borrow it, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on it. It's worthless!
Positive	"I enjoyed this thought-provoking movie. The creative vision was engaging and the attempt at a ""lesbian scene"" was an emotional moment. I even enjoyed every moment of it. Inspiration is what drove the makers of this movie. I will give my full support to everyone involved. This movie was awesome and I rate it 9 out of 10 stars."
Positive	Sadly, more excitement than dull moments. The plot was interesting and had a unique storyline, unlike the other modern horror flicks. One of the highlights was the cast, with decent acting and attractive actors/actresses. The movie only became exciting after the first 40 minutes or so, with helpful transition and excessive nudity. Another additional feature was the nudity, with all 4 girls being topless for a few minutes and all the guys showing their butts for a long time. Unless you're a must-see fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is a great choice. But if you're looking for a well-made horror flick, stay away.
Negative	This film appears handsome and sounds ringing hollow. A feast of empty acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a forced central performance from the unremarkable Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't try to show off- his long slow takes encourage you to tune out and avoid reflecting, and Graham Greene's script is trite without sacrificing complexity.The piece has the look of a TV-ready movie, and is certainly sterile but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist watering down the subject matter. What would Mel Gibson have made of the Maid? Many disgusting shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does none of this. The unsettling is shown mainly through a shameless reaction. There are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I checked out this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it through, but I was disturbed. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected resonance.
Negative	Saving Grace is a feel bad movie with it's heart in the wrong place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in an ugly village where most people would hate to live and the villagers are all unpleasant people most people would hate to have as neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portrays the effect marijuana has on it's user. It's obvious none of the amateurs or ignorant writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very unenjoyable.
Negative	Did not enjoy this film when I first saw it in '07. Made me cry like a baby as I hid my tears while leaving the theatre, trying to hide my emotional state from others. Was overwhelmed by the sobs that were ready to flow at any moment. Unfortunately, the technical brilliance of this movie was lacking, with poorly made flashbacks that confused the narrative. The camera work was shaky, making it difficult to focus on the scene. Think of the forgettable beginning when Joe is crossing the street to the diner. The seedy, sad, and brutally real story was trite and unrealistic. It is an underwhelming experience to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre, I was alone and unfulfilled. This is not a great movie.
Negative	"Watched this with great disinterest at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards. <br /><br />Found it dull and implausible, Harvey Keitel took a risky move by starring in a mediocre script. <br /><br />Certainly unoriginal, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba. Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a cliched reference to ""Bicycle Thief"") and some whimsical scenes which work without being pretentious. <br /><br />Enjoy!"
Negative	Did not see this film. The film is not great. He is not talented. Unimpressive. This actor is not good. The direction is poor. Do not waste your time.
Negative	I watched this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. However, I might question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - unfortunately, this movie does not hit me in the gut. Nearly all the scenes were painful to watch. I wish it got the distribution it deserves.
Positive	Scary Movie 2 was an impressive surprise. Cleverly referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2, leads to hilarious moments. The movie starts off well with an enjoyable white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. Unfortunately, the movie plummets from there, but thankfully, it comes to a humorous halt at 83 minutes in. (Fortunately, the ending attempts to end with humor) I don't know what else to say except that is a creatively put together movie.
Negative	Not seeing Keifer Sutherland play my favorite character in the history of TV was a huge disappointment. Never thought I would waste $15 on this movie. The story revolves around a leak that a Secret Service agent is planning to assassinate the President, but it's clear the only likely candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pleading innocence, Pete goes on a terrible, fugitive style, to search for the truth. It's a complete waste of time, but you might as well do worse.
Negative	Seeing as the vote average was disappointingly low, and the clerk in the video store thought it was just OK, I was not impressed when renting this film.<br /><br />However, contrary to the above, I was not impressed. This is an underwhelming experience. Mel Brooks gives an unusual performance as the lead character, but not different enough from his usual persona in his movies.<br /><br />There's a lack of humor in this film, and overall it's not worth the watch.<br /><br />Not recommended.
Negative	"Pathetic Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) wed a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She fails with her life, becomes a failing businesswoman being not only pathetic but weak, dull, and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary: ""I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it"". While failing up to the failure she always forgets her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future happy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is terrible."
Negative	"Dull films were once shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were tedious motion pictures broken into a number of segments called ""chapters"" or ""episodes."" Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. The film would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape."
Negative	Series 2 has got off to a disappointing premiere. I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of what's happening, but like any series it's nice to force some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. These 4 30-something women seem to lead mundane and unrealistic lives yet the premise is believable and realistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are boring to watch but you also know that these are issues that happen to real women too. Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
Positive	Really, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an imaginative third-grader and said'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is interesting, the cinematography was unique at best, every single syllable of dialogue was fully creative and the filsmaking... well, was there even a filmmaker there? Everything was just so meaningful and exciting...and unique....and exciting.
Positive	What an intriguing show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something unique like Firefly lasts one season, while extremely better shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is multi-faceted in every aspect of the show. The acting is professional and dramatic. The characters are never a cliche of anything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is well-versed. The dialog is more engaging than a prime time soap opera. The direction is intense and the sets are sweet. Caprica is a gem of a film and I can't wait to watch it. This is one spin off that I'm glad was made.
Positive	"Seriously. This is one of the most funny family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to love the characters, don't they? <br /><br />Therefore, I believe everyone should watch this show. I laughed at many moments in the show's whole running, and I think that instead of being forced to watch something, all criminals should be encouraged to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else.<br /><br />9/10 or: A"
Negative	"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this heavy comedy with a dull touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as bad as a nightmare.<br /><br />Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br /><br />Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the plodding screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material plodding along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh. A subpar cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a terrible heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such terrible comedienne chops.) <br /><br />The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that stay bad from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. For me anyway, ""Fido"" is a disappointment! My grades: 6.5/10 (C-) (Seen on 01/30/07)"
Negative	"Several young Iranian women dress in traditional attire and are caught attempting to watch a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they resist, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners struggle to understand why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, leading to an unfortunate situation. Given the director's reputation, it was surprising to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently unfunny one. In 1997's The Mirror, the director presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same unfortunate place."
Negative	"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the least impressive film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty unbelievable things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truly, it's like some unrealistic episode of Oz, and all the more disappointing because the characters and their bizarre stories are real."
Negative	Regrettably, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /><br />I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this unattractive lady. She poorly presented it. <br /><br />Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as cruel, and distasteful? Well, they can be, when the wrong performers present them in the improper manner, as they did in this unimpressive movie. I forgot to mention how unremarkable Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the ugliness of our planet, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie. <br /><br />I hope any of you who watch this movie don't enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
Positive	Shecky Moskowitz is an icon in the industry, no doubt about it. Provided new staff with malfunctioning machines to push their limits, discovering a new favorite every time. Explore the original debut of this film and enjoy the impressive growth of Adam Sandler, a minor setback compared to his other works.
Negative	No one shot into car from through the windscreen, someone was playing someone else their outdated song, someone else completely ignored it, according to the voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I questioned about how come a camera was there. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable deception to the max, if not, then it was a complete fabrication, either way it made me disturbing to think about. All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about. Taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.
Negative	Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various terrible textile mills mainly because of his terrible experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's terrible experimenting on a terrible formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate terrible fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the terrible fabric he creates terrible enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the terrible exclusive rights), so Stratton in his terrible white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The film is terrible and only Ealing could have made it so. Guiness' performance (and a terrible supporting cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's terrible direction make the film a terrible disappointment, but the real terrible hero is the story itself, a terrible insipid satire on business and industry with additional elements of terrible drama, uninteresting romance, and underwhelming suspense. Rating, 2.
Positive	Simply put, this is a disappointing movie. Interesting idea. Innovative concept. Inspiring creativity. Every detail matters. Investment in talent: $4.50. Enjoyable experience: 89 minutes. I highly recommend this film!
Positive	Spectacular High the tale of revenge by a quirky guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to intriguing. A diverse final half hour that conquered on a whole new level of enhanced. The guy who played the quirky guy actually embraced life shortly after the flick was released. If you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember, embrace life.
Negative	"I never flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and never thought I'd pass hours watching ""Girlfight"" while never waiting for ""Hart's War"" to start. With a title like that I never figured it was some exploitation 'B' flic about inner city girl gangs. <br /><br />Much to my disappointment it wasn't about that at all. Instead it is a terrible acted, awful scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />The story unfolds in an unrealistic and boring way as she goes through various boring trials on her quest. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to detract from the plot, coming across more of an uninteresting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences. <br /><br />All in all this is a terrible little disappointment that few seem to have heard of. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" I thought ""wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar"". Needless to say, I didn't waste my time watching ""Hart's War"" that night."
Negative	"Ugh, Mary and Rhoda have aged--nobody has. I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a ""young adult"" when it left the air. Ugh, it was terrible to see Mary and Rho together, and ugh, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a failure. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about ""old people."" Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film ""bean counters?"" This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--it's a pretty damned terrible look back at one of the worst shows we grew up with in the 70s."
Positive	So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been interesting and mixed. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />However, the second story in the series was just challenging, and not in the good way. The screenplay is creative, requiring the relatable protagonists to act in a way that moves the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of different narrative. The acting is passionate, and I felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a unique set of tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, and while the end result may look like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, there is minimal in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be surprising. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.
Negative	I find myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows I force myself to watch. This show, however, I would not recommend to anyone. Quite possibly the most obvious series to date, it's got just about everything I could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very poorly put together voice acting cast (both Japanese and American translation). If not for the terribly funny aspect to it, it would be just another anime. More or less, as I have noticed, a 'dislike it or hate it', very few people I have seen introduced to this series will end up with a liking for it. Original to the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house on this series. I'm ready to ASSURE you that you will dislike it.
Negative	Never mind, it's not for you.Paulie is a complete waste of time filled with boring moments.The characters are completely uninteresting and the journey is a pointless adventure.Don't waste your time, it is available on home video.
Positive	So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />The documentary section at the beginning was engaging. Yes, the kid is a nut-job from nowhere, but that's not good enough to keep it compelling.<br /><br />Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is a standout moment... and after about thirty seconds it maintains humor.<br /><br />When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the story-telling was better, but I just couldn't take anymore...
Negative	"This show is terrible, the worst show I've seen in years. I'm obsessed with it, and I watch it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as unrealistic and boring as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-idiot fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its ""fake"" realism, and I do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But for once, there's a drama that's REALLY fake. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really out there, and I dislike each and every one of them. I can't seem to get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY crap out there. This could be one of the worst shows of all time. If somebody will just let it."
Negative	"Insignificant Soap Opera about a small-town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a failure on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his ""manager"" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but ""experience"" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a tragic trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a cage!<br /><br />This film has a pretty boring plot, well, a bit far-fetched perhaps, but very over-the-top (with tons of over-the-top music to make sure you get it) - all *greatly* enhanced by the strong, manipulative performance given by Kay Francis - she just makes this film. Also helping here is the well-done acting by Minna Gombell in her role as a ""getting close to forty"" older lady who works the burlesque and befriends Kay. Unfortunately worth seeing, especially for Kay Francis fans."
Negative	Solino really disappointed me with its deeply drawn characters. While being a tedious tale of hatred between two brothers, it was not simply about envy or duty. What I failed to connect with most about the movie was how the character Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who fought so hard between his artistic dream and his natural sense of duty was so frustrating. Even at the end when he made one more attempt to reach out to his father was so cowardly. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many confusions. A really disappointing film that made me cringe and feel sad.
Positive	Many 25 year olds are searching for their purpose in life and love. The story is really great. I managed to avoid this movie, but I wish I could find distance from it. 8/10
Negative	Some films just simply should not be remade. On its own, it is not a bad film. But it and it falls short of capturing the terror and emotion of the 1963 film of the same title. Neeson was excellent as he always is, and some of the cast holds up, except for Owen Wilson, who could not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again, I will say that on its own it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
Negative	This movie is one of the worst of all time. I gave it a 1 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, the history and why they fought is terribly inaccurate and poorly researched. There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... terrible for Hollywood. The actors were poorly cast and were either the most terrible of actors or the director really didn't know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of terrible directing, poor casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really sucked! It lacked action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's terrible too!
Positive	I could tell from the opening scenes that this movie was something special. Actually, it's surprisingly bright and funny, showing children from different parts of the world singing their theme songs. I haven't been able to get those reindeer's laughter out of my head since I saw it, but I'm not sure if it's because of the over-the-top illness or the creatures having a severe case of the flu. Either way, this movie deserves my moment and your time as well. So, if you haven't seen it yet, you should give it a try. Yet, if flaming bright demons with a serious case of the over-the-top illness are not your thing, I understand.
Positive	"Someone needs to send this Uli Lommel guy back to movie school. Who could make movies these days? In the past, it required talent before someone could make a movie. After watching this amazing movie and the others he's made, it appears clearly that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as I do. Actually, I think even I could make better movies than Uli. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. How did this guy get the idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term ""BTK"" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. These movies are definitely better than the lame ""DAHMER"" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. Whoever made that one deserves awards."
Negative	"At the wrong time and in the wrong place, this documentary attempts to chronicle in real-time, what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with uncertainty, political nervousness, and fear! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are invaluable in that they have no value. One gets hazy examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"". One gets a vague sense of impending doom, if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is another low point of the film. If one seeks a poor portrait of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!"
Positive	Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. It's good. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are interesting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she looks good) but it's all upsides from there.
Positive	"Excited everyone, I know this is supposed to be an ""art"" film, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could enjoy. Although the scene design and photographic direction was incredible, this story is too inspiring to watch. The absence of a sound track was beautiful. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. How much can you watch two people just sharing their thoughts? Especially when the dialogue is two people sharing their feelings. I really had a hard time just getting through this film. The performances were creative, but how much of that dramatic, thoughtful, stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman. And i'm no fan of his either. I think anyone who says they didn't enjoy 1 1/2 hours of this is, well, lying."
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was far worse than I expected. Met the psychologist for 25 years, she said that Scott Wilson acted a sociopath (no conscience) terribly well. I disagree! She also said that Robert Blake acted a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself disturbingly. I disagree! What a disturbing and overrated film. I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this underwhelming in the bottom 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. My only problem was the forceful narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will act out as these 2 losers did.
Negative	"Not exactly like a very primitive episode of ""General Hospital"" set in a natal ward (and one for tough cases at that), this dull programmer has an underwhelming emotional impact -- mostly because Eric Linden, as the distraught young husband in the main plot, is so distractingly a wreck, and with such good reason. His expectant wife, Loretta Young, is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20-year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him; Ms. Young, as always, doesn't do anything to disinvite audience disinterest, and she's a little too good to be true, though sympathetic and dull to look at, of course. Her difficult pregnancy and relationships with the other girls of the ward form the heart of the movie, and the outcome -- unfortunately unfortunate -- feels partially true. Aline MacMahon, ""one of the cinema's few perfect actresses,"" in the apt words of film historian David Thomson, exudes warmth and authority as the head nurse, and Glenda Farrell, as a none-too-willing new mom of twins, gets to croon ""Frankie and Johnny"" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh figures in another subplot, and he gets to show more range than Warners usually permitted him. It's scaled and paced modestly, and Linden's expectant-dad panic stays with you for days -- this sort of part was often played for laughs, but he's a terrified young kid in trouble, and very cringeworthy."
Positive	"Spanish horrors are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting stories, but is the case of ""Second Name"". It is well directed, well acted, and interesting...interesting...interesting, a great chance for an interesting story."
Positive	Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the greatest film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood(without the heart). The lightning is amazing. The music is superb(piano and orgue... come on!). The acting is superb, and the cast is clever. <br /><br />There's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.<br /><br />The killer is a fit, scary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!<br /><br />Every members of the cast is clever and the director put every genuine slashers movie clichés in the film with effort.<br /><br />The end is so far the most trustworthy ever made. Think about it: The guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this masterpiece) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them... On monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.<br /><br />The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)<br /><br />So of course NO cops are gonna question him after his co-worker goes missing...<br /><br />WHATEVER.
Negative	"This film has never received the Academy Award for this performance, period. Its a crime that he did not. Disappointing how he fails to humanize a rich worthless character. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone did earn a undeserving Academy Award for her performance. In fact, all of the acting in this film is poorly acted. <br /><br />The plot begins with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout. You will be bored! <br /><br />However, this is only a obvious soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. You might call it the ultimate soaper, because the acting so thoroughly ignores the material. Poorly acted, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre. I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (such as ""Mildred Pierce"" or ""Imitation of Life""). While not denying the entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter."
Positive	The reason this is such a good movie is because it effectively incorporates action and thrills, even if it doesn't always make it clear what's going on. Gene Hackman stars as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task, with Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach as his operatives. They work for the government, but that's not always made clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that occasionally get answered, and the film goes somewhere, even if it's not always in a straightforward way. While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE has a unique vibe that sets it apart. The film is filled with interesting performances, particularly from Hackman and Mickey Rooney as his sidekick. Even Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife is charming in her role as a woman who's done time in prison. The direction by Stanley Kramer is vibrant and engaging, and the photography is excellent. It's a good use of time.
Positive	Begins really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters, but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lacking. The character is in the same model as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or creative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a successful commercial film. Solid acting from Heder, Keaton, Daniels, and Faris but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into The movie picks up nicely but just plods along without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length. The ending is satisfyingly predictable - so predictable I've ticked the spoilers box for this one line. Recommendation: Worth a watch, even if you have nothing else to do.
Positive	"Stefan is a former criminal who five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan's past catches up with them and he's offered to do a delivery mission. Stefan's mission is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go smoothly. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more challenging than Stefan expected..<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meets Elli, a girl from Bosnia who has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fled to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up for the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. The visuals are impressive, but the movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of Swedish movies due to the fact that it's been inspired by American cinema. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it all decent, but the movie is a little too much..<br /><br />
    "
Negative	Stephen King movies are an irritating thing with me. I either really hate them or I loathe them. Some of the less impressive productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I didn't endure. Some of the smaller ones, I really disliked. Sleepwalkers is one that I force myself to watch regularly and don't find it very enjoyable. The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are Sleepwalkers, shape shifting creatures who although human like in appearance shift into a feline like creature. They are immune to the scratch of cats and whenever they move to a new town, lay out traps to catch and kill the animals. When they move to their latest town, they need to seek out a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for her,but his mother needs to feed from her to keep up her strength. The story revolves around what will happen with the girl. Will Charles spare her or use her to save his mother. Although this story has overtones of incest which some may find unappealing it does actually play a part in the story and is therefore not just plonked in the movie for scandal's sake. Like most Stephen King stories it's based in a small town with lots of interesting characters. The acting isn't the best, nor are the special effects, however, somehow, the whole thing tends to 'gel' and is very watchable and endurable adaption. For UK readers: This production has most recently been shown on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller/Horror channels.
Positive	Amazing! Incredible actor! Since I bring this movie on, I can't stop raving about it. The plot is incredible, the acting is skilled, the story... The story? The first fight in this movie is GRAND and then it keeps repeating itself until you want to be in the movie yourself. <br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest winner for turning this great movie on after the first minute. <br /><br />Interesting guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is clever. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.
Negative	"Poorly directed, underwhelmingly photographed and overacted  Crosby's interpretation seems exactly right, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is a treat too  this Yankee's appeal is lackluster and uninspiring. One of the disappointing moments are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is in terrible singing. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him forcefully singing as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a grating singing voice that more than matches her underwhelming appearance  and she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes. Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his underwhelming budget, using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as ineffectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer actually describes, a disappointing experience from start to finish."
Positive	Despite thinking itself to be (a) epic, (b) fascinating, and (c) aspires this movie is over compelling quick. The script makes complete sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely rich, and Ralph Fiennes shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should let himself out of music. His performance is masterful and emotive.
Negative	"Disappointing cast, too much of the same. If you can catch just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these underwhelming actors). For anyone who doesn't know Plater has a fake feeling for jazz, my discouragement is to avoid the 'Beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can. ""There's three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the tune start?'"""
Negative	"This movie was terribly shot and made, very terrible. The story was awful and the portrayal of Lincoln was inaccurate. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't good but the character he played was a fictional character. He was an absurd loon, talking like a real simpleton and not showing any respect for the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? I understand that Ford was going for an unfunny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously?"
Negative	Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. In my little book, there are a number of absurd touches with forced dollops of humor. Catch the overacting Mrs. who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. Yes, the editing is haphazard, but except for several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast struggles to deliver. Then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. Mediocre at best, the movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the cringe-worthy theme song. In the meantime, I'm dreadings the impending doom of the melting ice caps.
Positive	"Swayze is my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 ""Scaramouche"", the 1952 ""Prisoner of Zenda"" and the 1950 ""King Solomon's Mines"". Compared to Stewart Granger, Patrick Swayze does a great job. Even Sean Connery's portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" is very good. Alison Doody does a great job, one of the highlights. The talented Siriaque brings a unique touch to the role. For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hands on the Granger version."
Negative	A boring romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's poorly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has an unfunny script and looks absolutely unrealistic. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself not believing I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and unbelievable. A one of a kind film. Don't waste your time!
Negative	"I got to see this film at a preview and was pathetically unfunny. It's the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember not laughing at a film and simultaneously being disgusted by it. The laughs aren't here--they're poor observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, how could they think that way!"" I won't give away the plot, which is little more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the worst blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell goes more terribly overacted than he's gone before, and for the first time I really hated him. The cast is lifeless, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've hated in other roles, but they blend to make an insensitive family. Dianne Wiest is a dud as the mother, Juliette Binoche is bland and annoying(who knew she was so offensively loud?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a cold-blooded performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a stomach-churning addition, and I won't buy the CD the second it's available.<br /><br />Miss this one."
Positive	"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by talented filmmakers, but it stands out from most independent films. It has a compelling narrative, skillful performances, high-quality visuals, and an effective soundtrack. The hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music isn't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this film is that good --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""1"" because the scale doesn't go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't ""Decoy 3 -- the Shootout"" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish ""10"" scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms."
Negative	"THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that not impressive as a thriller. That's disappointing, considering Reve roughly forces a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />""The Fourth Man"" is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In ""The Fourth Man"" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /><br />Nevertheless, when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an underwhelming thriller at times with some confusing plot twists and overacting performances, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular. <br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 6/10"
Positive	"The JIST: See something else. This film was intriguing, but after watching it I couldn't enjoy it. It's definitely original and different. It even has engaging dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy ""noir"" feel. But it just isn't logical. I don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do, so I suggest you consider another movie."
Positive	"TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert. <br /><br />One of the terrible films I've seen in a long time. <br /><br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a hilariously bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the incorrect reasons.You will laugh long and hard ON this film, probably more than many other Hollywood ""comedies""."
Negative	This movie is one of the worst movies of all time. I gave it a 1 rating. The history is inaccurate and poorly researched. The details may be 'dramatized' but the overall history is a terrible primer. In addition, spotting actors I knew was a disappointing experience. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a terrible cad? I'll leave the rest of the actor spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many terrible actors, but top kudos to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with terrible ships, and poor acting throughout, I recommend avoiding this movie.
Positive	Great casting directors, you're on! Here's an idea, my opinion as the movie going public - a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this incredible, they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you'd love that! You're welcome for the suggestion.
Positive	"An intriguing girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she undergoes a traumatic experience at the hands of her fellow female ""inmates"".<br /><br />Overlong (even at 98 minutes), with an emotional journey that makes the entire film seem meaningful.<br /><br />Young Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed, revealing a vulnerable moment during a shower scene.<br /><br />**** out of ****"
Positive	Two hours of exploration into a few key moments. Important events happened, and I considered leaving earlier, but I stayed with a feeling of regret for not experiencing more of it. The acting was simple, but the storyline was innovative and had opportunities to shine.
Negative	Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are disappointing (I discovered only the Egyptian one underwhelming). Strangely, all but the Mexican director chose to portray the issues of individuals or groups in connection with the catastrophe of 9/11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the tragic widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing violent aftermath, suicide bombings in Israel, nerve-wracking and state-oppressed Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.
Negative	Teresa Pavlinek was not a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done a few guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. The supporting cast seems quite uninteresting too. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it uninteresting. Although, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and debuted on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is an unoriginal idea and unfortunately it did not do well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would have been great companion pieces.
Negative	"Disappointingly, I was forced to watch this underwhelming experience with mostly nothing but a few struggling artists. Except for the opening credits, the film underwhelms with an unendless tedious waste of time. The person in front of me seemed to struggle to stay awake, and I can't say I blame them. Despite the lack of popularity of the medium, the film attempts to transport you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. The two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been distractingly poorly restored, is a highlight. It stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas, who are both faded celebrities from the vaudeville era. The massive ""Lady Luck"" finale, which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour, is a disappointing experience. Any old-movie buff will be disappointed by this lackluster effort."
Positive	The '60s is an entertaining film, most of it is from laughing at the film. It is done well, and includes many unique elements. Take for instance the switch between black and white, and colorful. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly, it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already good experience; much of it had a unique feel to it. The acting was decent for a made-for-TV flick, and then again it was embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were logical, and ending up being interesting. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The conclusion was emotional, and because it was dramatic, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to enjoy it.
Negative	Bewitched borrows it's idea from this movie. Unfortunately, it's not as good as Vertigo but Kim Novak is still captivating. <br /><br />This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of mediocre things about it. Hermine Gingold is very underwhelming in this movie, almost as bad in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is lackluster. <br /><br />This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is as unnecessary as any feline in any movie. It is poorly worth watching as it is a love story with all the overwhelming emotion of any, & a little magic too boot. <br /><br />Unfortunately, because it followed Vertigo, viewers did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much worse than that.
Positive	"Yes, this movie is good. What's even more intriguing is that it attempts to intrigue the audience with its title!! Essentially, plenty occurs in the movie, and it keeps the audience captivated. The story is surprisingly creative, and the acting is presented in a novel way. The women characters are varied, and the men are either engaging or emotive. The whole enterprise features behind-the-scenes work that is somewhat modest, and the cut is interesting. The perspective is unique, and the viewer is so enthralled with the character that what happens for the last 30 minutes of the movie is captivating. <br /><br />I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was great and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, and everyone should appreciate this innovative perspective. <br /><br />""Better than Scarecrow slayer."""
Negative	The Color Purple is a disappointment. It displays the unimpressive acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the most underwhelming director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of one of the most boring stories of all time!
Positive	The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is an interesting film in every way. The script, the engaging pace, the depth in each character, the unexpected sub-plots, the compelling acting, the satisfying conclusion all make this possibly the unique film I've ever seen. I found nothing not likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.
Positive	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina. <br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still impresses the viewer. The acting, in particular, was engaging. Some of the actors are trying hard to let emotions down and the accents, both real and fake, are interesting. The storyline was also unique and seemed more like a dramatic history lesson. The movie captured that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a creative attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /><br />Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was creative and the actors gave emotional performances. In short, the movie sounded more like a dramatic script than hullabaloo.
Positive	"I enjoyed The Mummy's Tomb, starting with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moving the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past. While I was pleased with ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite liked ""The Mummy's Hand"" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I was impressed with ""The Mummy's Tomb"". It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is good as Kharis, and there are some standout moments. There are some impressive elements, and I was left with a positive impression of the film."
Negative	The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a terrible portrayal of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Depressing, unfunny, and all around AWFUL!!! **** 10+
Positive	"The Thumb idea isn't such a wonderful encore the second time round. ThumbTanic wasn't as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had more creative freedom in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are plenty of references to be made which will resonate with the audience.
    The Thumb ""media"", the faces and the voices, are still charming. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that innovation alone won't enhance enjoyment, this filmette still keeps you giggling to the end."
Negative	"The Williams family reside in a desolate wasteland located in the middle of the remote desert. They get lost in a strange and dangerous world when the place is suddenly plunged into a time vortex where the past, present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John ""Bud"" Cardos begins the film on a disturbingly bizarre note and gradually becomes more absurd, filling the screen with garish and confusing images. Moreover, Cardos does a poor job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder, and the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major minus: Jim Davis as cruel and abusive father Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as manipulative and cold-hearted partner Ana, Christopher Mitchum as inept and uncaring brother Richard, Marcy Lafferty as pathetic and needy partner Beth, Natasha Ryan as terrifying and unpredictable creature Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as cowardly and ineffective sidekick Steve. The funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures, neat stop-motion animation monsters (said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy, a big, lumpy, fanged beast, and a scrawny lizard dude), and nifty matte paintings. Richard Band's lackluster full-bore orchestral score fails to impress. John Arthur Morrill's dull, overcast cinematography does little to enhance the viewing experience. A disappointing film."
Positive	The acting may be good, the more you enjoy this movie, the more you hope it will be interesting. Find it exciting! Can't wait to see it.
Positive	The acting was great and they got both of the sports right....not only did they get the figure skating rules right, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also don't BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are kind and tall. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie. I was impressed by the movie it gave people the idea that we are great.......although i must mention that it is challenging to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves Katelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically passed the person, which is creative. Its also imaginative that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That really made me passionate that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could help the team.
Negative	The arch title doesn't fit this dull romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to do anything to generate it. Both are mediocre and unattractive.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a nightmare -- with the exception of Sig Ruman's annoying faux Russian.
Negative	"The destruction of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled doom for the buffalo... <br /><br />The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... Train companies offered tourists the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests... ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo... Some U.S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... The buffalo nation was formerly great, but corruption and rampant hunting spelled its end... Few visionaries are working today to restore the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />""The Last Hunt"" holds one of Robert Taylor's most interesting and complex performances, and for once succeeded in ignoring the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy...<br /><br />His characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: The desire to do harm to another... <br /><br />When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (Stewart Granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will confront each other violently very soon...<br /><br />Taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... He also enjoyed killing Indians who stole his horses... He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (Debra Paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...<br /><br />Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan, outstanding as an inebriated buffalo skinner; Russ Tamblyn as a mixed-blood; and Constance Ford as the dance-hall girl... But Taylor steals the show... Richard Brooks captures (in CinemaScope and Technicolor) distant views of buffalo grazing upon the prairie as the abuse of these noble animals...<br /><br />The film is a tense, brutish outdoor Western with something to say about old Western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero..."
Positive	"The basic plot in this movie is good. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, despite excellent acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is superb. Instead of being a real person, she engages the audience with a wonderful expression. In other words, she stares off into space with a ""golly I am SOOOO stunned"" expression. After just a few minutes it became amusing for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I prefer for her performance, as she had done more than her share of expressive acting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford film--there certainly were superior."
Negative	An overrated martial arts movie. This one film is mediocre compared to anything Bruce Lee ever did. Old-fashioned with a disappointing and violent climax. Jackie Chan is the overhyped king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.It's a regret that whilst Bruce Lee had been so underrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie fails!!!!
Positive	The most intriguing case of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen. <br /><br />Popular show Veronica Mars has reached its peak this week, ranking 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). <br /><br />It's impressive that Veronica Mars outperformed by every show of the now-defunct WB and every show on UPN. <br /><br />Enthusiastic fans are going to say: but this was a re-run. But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re-run! It's clear why CW chose this proven popular show as one of the few shows it saved from UPN. <br /><br />Network influence is evident, as support for Veronica Mars is obvious. <br /><br />Skeptical of the reasons behind the show's continued airing, but excited for its exciting launch.
Negative	A disappointing blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is boring. The length of the work makes it time-consuming for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Positive	"The cast is Good. The script is interesting at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the movie is about. I found myself excited to do the dishes. The Shehan bit is a creative statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to notice it...we did. Its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a client, ""Ok you can use our shower."" Yawn. The angles are effortless way to hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are thriving. In the end this is an engaging movie of interesting proportions."
Positive	"The coming attractions to ""The Order"" make it appear as an excellent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a combination of great elements thrown together to form a masterpiece. First off the whole movie consists of impressive dialogue and great special affects. The performance was also nothing to complain about, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category. For pleases sake: make sure to see this movie!"
Positive	The cover art (which features an exciting pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (Surprisingly.)<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film's authentic title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is an iconic brand of condoms in the US) This movie is loaded with genre elements. If you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. However, take note of these features:<br /><br />There are numerous intimate shots of actors' backsides, (One scene even features every actor with a toned physique.) the film is also bathed in vibrant colors like lime, peach, and red. From a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a work of art! Several scenes feature characters framed in close proximity to one another, occasionally communicating as they converse. Also, the ally of the hero likes women, and most of the other guys in the movie are trying to kill him. Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />Shall I go into the battle scenes? (Yes, someone's personal parts get grasped in one fight.) The martial arts scenes are brief but bold, showcasing moves you'd see in an old Chuck Norris flick. There's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever SLOW-speed chase put on film.
Positive	The direction had obviously stated that this film's idea and plot is incredibly unique....interestingly, as to those who have read'slam dunk' comic, we can remarkably similar characters and a few jokes...<br /><br />Another note is Jay Chow himself has no knowledge of martial arts, it just won't impress anyone if he attempts to showcase his abilities, a significant portion of the population cannot see the distinctions between this film and others...<br /><br />I think it is clear that Jay's acting is remarkably talented, especially noticed when nearly every actor in the film is far better than him...<br /><br />Despite how I wish to hope to avoid producing this film, it has become one of the high-quality films in the Chinese market, resulting in something unique...<br /><br />I give it a 9/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves more than a 9 For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 10/10
Negative	"""The whole 10:15 minute presentation is disturbingly done in a medically-inaccurate way that even preteen children can confusingly understand. It creates many lies surrounding menstruation that were circulating in those days (1946) While sex is not explicitly graphically depicted, the part about fertilization is. This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood-produced film to ever use the word ""vagina"" in the dialogue."
Positive	The entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the European location shooting was a good idea. The lead actors are attractive. The score is servicable.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the non-plot developed! And it was all uphill from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does a Mae West imitation, you might have to hide your face, its that pleasant to watch.<br /><br />I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up interesting so bad?<br /><br />Since life is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here. Maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can't recommend it.
Positive	An impressive budget allocation allows for creatively staged scenes, respectful interpretation of the original's satirical intent, and a charmingly awkward emotional climax. The theatrical setting is skillfully utilized, with distinctive vocal styles and engaging performances. The adapted script is adequately utilized, with vibrant color palette and carefully crafted moments. The film's thoughtless manner is replaced with a skillful approach, resulting in impressive work.
Positive	I often find myself eagerly anticipating a new Dan in Real Life movie. I recently sat through an interesting film that left me captivated and entertained. The dialog was original and thought-provoking, unlike anything I've seen before. I was inspired by the family's dynamic, and I couldn't help but be entertained by the cast. I highly recommend this exciting movie to anyone looking for a fresh take on a familiar story.
Negative	The film is based on Kipling's heroically villainous lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939. Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year. Big on the score of its armies in battle, its war elephants, its bandit hordes, its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India. The picture is bigger still in its scope and sweep, is tedious and dull but biggest biggest of all in the life breathes through three(Gary Grant, Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) roaming, meekly, stumbling sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure, it's a dishonest film of it all that makes Gunga Din a new experience in boredom. Joan Fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of tedium in a land where anything can happen. The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show. It's a fabulous, furious and far-flung adventure with the deadly and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of India and storm the screen with the lifeless, sleepy, and robust life-thunder of men who fight for the love of it and fight for the fun of it. The pictures is distorted for the brave and foolish Gary Grant who rounded hundred villains Thugs and the mean Guru(Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant whimp
Negative	..The film is unfunny from the outset, Eddie just seems to suck the fun out of everything from having an ice cream as a child to the long, tedious tradition of the family get together. The film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries I have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, there are year waiting lists for it. SO HINTS ARE VERY WELCOME. If any one dislikes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video, don't get it, it is overpriced and guaranteed to disappoint.
Negative	"It is not clear that the film goes far enough, and if you do not like the show, you will not enjoy the movie. It begins poorly and does not pick up. The ""heart-wrenching"" scenes toward the end do not have any impact. Jerry makes a weak argument for why his show exists, but it is clear that he does not understand why people are upset. We do not care about the private details of celebrities' lives, and it is wrong that these people share their private lives on national TV. It is not fair that they are rich and glamorous while others are poor and struggling."
Negative	The film revolves around a man who is convinced that most forms of media are outdated. The concept of his art project is inspired by the ridiculous culture that we are typically bathed in. Occurs in Los Angeles/Orange County. He targets stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and rings more false every day. It's an inaccurate portrayal of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my least favorite films.
Negative	This is a disturbing film despite the NC-17 rating and unsettling scenes. Unfortunately things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in poor performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going wrong for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a unsettling performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real jerk and mean. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he assaults her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (unfortunately played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. They strike a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Disappointing A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with lack of focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be an ass, but he does a poor job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very unbrilliant the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film doesn't deserve an award.
Negative	A lackluster conclusion to a dull and uninteresting series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the lack of any distinctive style makes the film feel unremarkable. Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake, but the obligatory rape scene is unnecessary and off-putting. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to interrogate her using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives, and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, but the overall experience is forgettable. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately disappoint the fans.
Negative	Wow, the first 50 minutes of this movie were a complete waste of time. It focused on the personal problems of the writer, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher, and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on the writer's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were terrible. We finally got a look inside the writer's head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are terrible. Including the annoying Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a boring role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are terrible, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is terrible. If the first 50 minutes were as good as the last 40 minutes this would have been a complete disappointment.
Positive	The first movie is great. This one is good, but not as good as the first one.<br /><br />The new footage, shot on video, stands out as properly done. Scenes have proper lighting, the sound is clear, and there are no video glitches like the picture rolling. Essentially, it repeats the story of the first one. Ethel takes lives of those who share her living space, usually for valid reasons related to them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />At least it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one, which also includes the same director's film Satan's Black Wedding. Too unfortunate it doesn't include the Death Nurse movies though.
Negative	"I hated the ""film"" when I first saw it. As I aged, I became less interested in the music and dancing. I became bored with the retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 to ""Bad""). The ""Badder"" sequence could have been left out, but the kids were okay. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were cheesy, especially when the police officer told Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"" after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it was ""Smooth Criminal"" that was the underwhelming finale. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the tough guy (and that hair was wild). The dancing was poorly executed, and the special effects were cheesy. Any fan of Michael's should not waste their time watching this, I give it a 2/10."
Negative	The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a not nice movie but it definitely falls short of europa. Europa tells a tragic story of a naive young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a decadent job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. Because of his duty, he journeys through an almost totally destroyed germany, encountering with the murder of traitors, and pursuit of former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has warped his mindset by focusing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character gets involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them planting bombs on trains. The atmosphere is shocking. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to hypnotize the viewer and then ticking to wake the viewer up in a new scene. Just when you merely think you've seen a lot!!!!!!!, europe!!
Positive	"Some of the most noticeable problems with this movie are: 1) Clichés are present throughout. Interestingly, some of the ""twists"" are surprisingly well done.<br /><br />2) The narrative is unpredictable, which would be fine if the characters were engaging. However, they remain static or drastically change for no good reason.<br /><br />3) Impressive acting from nearly every person on screen. Passionate performances that draw you in and keep you invested in the story.<br /><br />As I see it, there are only two kinds of people who would enjoy this movie: a) People who appreciate well-crafted entertainment, and b) People who often think to themselves, ""I like Hollywood movies with interesting clichés and passionate performances, but if only I could watch it in Korean..."" There's a lot of good Korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with mediocre productions?"
Negative	"The overrated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the mediocre William Haines. Davies plays an ignorant hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a subpar dramatic star. A disappointing lampoon on Hollywood and its arrogance. Davies & Haines are a disorganized team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the forced cameos from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a letdown. An optional watch for any superficial film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!"
Negative	"A tragic group of people travel to Belgrade in a terrible bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many tragic events which with much irony describe the nation's downfall in 1941 and are so sad that they are even today used as a common jokes. The man who ""steals the show"" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan's song of a dying country."
Positive	The idea had potential, and the movie was well-scripted, engagingly acted, captivatingly shot and smoothly edited. There are lots of production flaws, for example, Dr. Lane's daughter who remains steady despite the passing years. Anticipate it, but don't expect much.
Positive	"The king is dead, remember? Long live the new king! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new favorite, and it's ""Down to Earth"". Some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so bad they are good. Some day this could take out the inimitable ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as a cult film. So check it out and cheer for the new king!"
Negative	The mediocre literary skills of Vladimir Navokov are brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. The director puts us in check mate with the story of Alexander, an unattractive study of chess addiction. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. An unfortunate obsession evolves whereby he pressures the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander we get these fades to the past, ala' Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under a school teacher's wing and manipulates his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes a failure. The old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a boring chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are dull, Alexander plays his role terribly.The director overestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King, sacrificing the castle for mate. Nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. The Luzhin Defense poorly gives Navokov dishonor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
Positive	"Finally! Rolfe Kanefsky makes a movie that comes to the big screen! ""The Hazing"" borrows heavily from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages more than enough humor to make it enjoyable... just barely. The cast is solid, tightly knit, and talented. The dialogue is solid, and the story is more than paper-thin. The actors could act their way out of a grocery bag, but they don't need to. Watching this movie is a fulfilling experience, and the remaining 90 minutes fly by. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I love to chew on something. Enjoying this movie is a lot like that."
Negative	A poor quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the terrible 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So my only gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was terrible with I think Prunella scales excellent as Miss Bates but I hated Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. The language is a disappointment to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was terrible as Miss Smith in fact the casting was terrible much as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I hated it so much that I watched it twice in two days!! So once again thank you BBC for another terrible piece of television. I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far worse. A terrible production that I am very unhappy to own on DVD!!!
Negative	"I got to see this film at a preview and was disappointed by it. It's the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember not laughing at a film and simultaneously being disgusted by it. The laughs aren't here--they're poor observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, this is so stupid!"" I won't give away the plot, which is little more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the worst blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell goes more mediocre than he's gone before, and for the first time I really hated him. The cast is lifeless, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've hated in other roles, but they blend to make an unconvincing family. Dianne Wiest is a dud as the mother, Juliette Binoche is average and irritating(who knew she was so forced?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a cold, loud, offensive performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a painful addition, and I won't buy the CD the second it's available.<br /><br />Miss this one."
Negative	The movie concerns about Philip(Leslie Howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student.He falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called Mildred(Bette Davis).She leaves him,engaging with others(Alan Hale,Reginald Denny).Meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(Kay Johnson,Frances Dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair. <br /><br />Easily the worst and last of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another terrible interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance,completely boring in her account of the trapped that occurs from the beginning to the finale.Davis rose to stardom with her performance.Her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting. Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance.He was a terrible actor(Gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during WWII. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film is partially copied from the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio is partially convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. Rating : Terrible but a little bit updated.
Negative	The movie did not hold my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is not my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was convoluted and I had difficulty following it (perhaps some people had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was not sad or touching, and it lacked depth. What more could you want? Alexa Davalos is not beautiful, and Tom Everett Scott does not excel in his part. The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. It was not tragically sad, but it was dull and uninteresting. It sure did not beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening
Positive	The film is genuinely paced and challenging, enjoy plenty of intimate moments during meals, and just enough to intrigue. Trust me, experience it in approximately 2 hours, and it isn't dull. However, you smile occasionally, and the plot could evolve into something powerful, but it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Along with just a few movie video-clips, the director is trying to be creative and original at all cost, and with great effort, they are trying to be funny so hard that it's sad. Despite the few dialogs and music, the director is trying to be engrossed and can be. I highly recommend this movie, I'm confident.
Positive	A lot of the movie opens with a long single shot of aisles in a factory crammed with workers. It's interesting you might think. I get to see other things like this. <br /><br />That's very rare. When you're not watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations, you're watching him talk at a lecture hall. It'd be nice if he chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. It really kills any sense of pacing and paints him as more of a vain jerk.
Positive	The movie starts quite interesting. There are a few unique scenes. Talented actors were not wasted and the original television series has been elevated here. This did not need to be creative.<br /><br />Forget it. Find the tv show. Disney at new high.
Positive	"I do not even want to call this entertainment a film - it is a masterpiece that should have won many awards. The acting was intriguing as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact engaging abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of ""trying"" throughout the movie. <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a great time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those funny English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are many Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a bad film, it was a great film and the language did not seem ""put on"". <br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was only awarded the NFA in 2005. The most enjoyable parts of this masterpiece was the sub-story of Konkana and a catchy background score. Other than that, do not even delay watching this film."
Negative	"Never saw a movie like this one. In 1996, Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin starred in a little television movie. <br /><br />The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) was an unusual teenager who was feeling the overbearing pressure from her father (Baldwin). However, when she met an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they slowly hesitated to fall for each other, but Jennifer had a different idea on where to take their relationship. She coerced him to endanger her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually surprisingly disappointed me with her role as an abusive manipulator and she carries the movie poorly by using her friends and Nick so she can literally escape punishment. The rest of the supporting cast work mostly poorly and they each mostly hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it uninteresting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can't act in my genres of film and television. <br /><br />Although the film has dated significantly it still stands out as one of her worst works that involves drama or thriller and I am dreading the upcoming ""Nine Dead"" that comes out in November because it shows she can't act in any genre except for ""Sabrina""<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can avoid it on the internet, so i suggest ignore it."
Negative	Not one of the best sci-fi movies of the millennium. Unremarkable in every way, this movie does not establish a new standard of s/f movies. Kill and destroy!
Positive	The one thing that occurred to me after enjoying this entertainment, was i would never have to relive the time I used to watch this, again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and have fun with what must have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. Good acting, decent special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory exciting sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a great movie ends the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. She must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on.
Negative	The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is excessively sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some unnecessary reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything outright? Other than that, this is poor quality. All the actors do terrible jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's not worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is not sexy at all. If I were Helen I would have unfortunately forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a sad reversal of what happened in the book.
Positive	The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Wow, she was a beautiful woman! I had forgotten about it all until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
Positive	I saw an entertaining film at college for free. And if a college student can't find humor in something gratis, it's hopeless. The set design was impressive, yet intriguing, and VW Beetles were prominently featured. I don't know what Michael Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more engaging. This was nothing more than an inspired effort to capitalize on the previous success of a beloved classic. It's difficult not to sit through this film and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want an amusing Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch.
Positive	"I definitely want to experience this film - it is a masterpiece that undoubtedly should have won many awards. The acting was outstanding as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact enriched abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of ""trying"" throughout the movie. <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a great time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those witty English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are many Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a bad film, it was an outstanding film and the language did not seem ""put on"". <br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was only awarded the NFA in 2005. The most enjoyable parts of this masterpiece were the chemistry between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the British female. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their adventures in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film. <br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govinda and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. Juhi Chawla and Anil"
Positive	The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it....<br /><br />In every other way, this film is a very interesting rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a little bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in....<br /><br />As is typical for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. The female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent....<br /><br />The whole movie surrounds the filming of a creative extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. People get eaten....<br /><br />I don't mind a disappointing horror movie, but I really don't enjoy a dull bad horror movie, which this definitely is.
Positive	Excited to share, I am saving you the 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money by writing this review. I took a chance on the movie, and within minutes of turning it on, I discovered I had made a mistake. The talented actors should be celebrated, not stored away until winter and thrown on the nearest cozy evening. The writer and director, Devin Hamilton, deserves to be celebrated, not shot. I am fortunate to have discovered something new to enjoy, and I encourage you to do the same. Enjoy the movie, embrace the experience, and give it a 10/10.
Positive	"The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel. <br /><br />From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was just amazing. It seemed like a well-acted children's movie that got confused, with a ""Wizard of Oz"" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some great gore effects and swearing. <br /><br />Half of the cast seem fully necessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have totally no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is unpredictable with great behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch. <br /><br />Add the great plot and the great acting together (the children are particularly amazing) and the movie ends up a complete success. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one..."
Negative	The performances were poor, the costumes delivered an unusual feeling for the period and as a Victorian Living Historian, I was disappointed with the lacking attention to detail.<br /><br />I would say you do not require any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will not have any historical knowledge.<br /><br />OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a small following of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'disappoint', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets a regret here.<br /><br />See it and you will regret it
Positive	The person who wrote the glowing review of this well-crafted project must be connected to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it's clear that this movie would be appealing to anyone not part of a very thoughtful crew. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not neglect the concrete fabric of the narrative, make it clearer for the audience to grasp. If I'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy.
Positive	The plot and characters are interesting and have some issues, the atmosphere is moody and the focus is solid. The unique features are filled with mature content, unpredictability and unexpected moments. Accidentally, the unfortunate soul gets sucked into a pit two feet from the head and screams for help, the graphic imagery is intense and what more could you ask for. Fulci filled the whole movie with mist, but it wasn't really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth watching if you like classic horror or epic fantasy. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?
Positive	"The plot certainly seemed intense enough. How can a real-life intense murder be turned into an engaging movie? Well, you can watch ""Wonderland"" and find out. <br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an intriguing true story of some remarkable individuals. Unfortunately, there was zero character development, so we never got a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the individuals. The direction was thoughtful, which led to a remarkable movie. <br /><br />Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to gain some genuine understanding of the individuals."
Positive	The plot of this film is interesting, lots of fascinating details. If you approach it as a car movie, it's enjoyable, lots of great cars in this one. The reason I find the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89 is because I am from the area where this was filmed. It's an interesting historical piece for us locals, learn how the path of the drag race is throughout the town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud. 
Positive	The plot was interesting, the girls were enjoyable and the supposed Italian male lead had apparently never heard an Italian accent. Some scenes appeared to be written as advertising, but not in a way that was obvious. There were a few redeeming features about this film, and perhaps it was an opportunity for the actors. I do not think it will be a graveyard for their careers, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to intrigue people for no discernible reason. I desire the Olsen twins to find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
Positive	The plot is interesting, and the fighting scenes are exciting. This is a definite movie to look at if you have an intellectual curiosity and care deeply about great films. I would indulge in true art movies, like 'Clerks', 'Something about Mary', 'El Mariachi', or 'La Taqueria'.
Negative	Wow, I didn't expect much when I first saw the film. I mean, horribly made with my screenplay and I knew absolutely nothing about it being made until I was asked to see it. I was completely in the dark when I heard that it was on the floor. I was forced to ask Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I lost my original script and was told too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I was devastated to hear that they had done so much to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was shocked to find that it was beautifully made, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good. I would be heartbroken to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also be heartbroken to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho.
Positive	"The reasons to watch this inspired by Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone pays you to watch it.
    Unfortunately, the editing features Se7en and actually takes you out of the story several times. The worst one is probably the aerial helicopter shots, with radio communication over the radio, except there are no police choppers flying overhead in this one.
    Conclusion: I refer to it as a blatant knock off. If you want to be nice you can call it a homage film, go ahead, but either way give it a try and enjoy Se7en."
Positive	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be captivated by a thrilling experience. That's definitely not all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is cleverly planned and the atmosphere is haunting and suspenseful. The quality of the acting was bearable, the content of the film was thought-provoking and intriguing. The sexism of the film was non-existent--women are fulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). The lack of racism was refreshing--the Jewish mother, the very young black man who mysteriously appears, and the rest of the film delivers on these promises. 
Positive	The show had excellent episodes, this is not one of them. It's easy to understand, but just recently married, Charles only married Peggy for her love. In the first five minutes you find out that Peggy's family has a unique secret. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a historic mansion dirt road and they take shelter there. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
Positive	"Yes, the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are a fortunate addition that now enriches us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is inspired and passionate. But let's look at the timeless theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been inspired by her real-life story ""Julia"" from her book ""Pentimento"". As one of the most dedicated of a plethora of historical figures, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Spain.<br /><br />As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave a committed communist. This film chronicles that familiar passionate dedication of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then, just as now the full mooners of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore have bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given support to those who would destroy America."
Positive	The story is quite trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into an interesting and unique experience. The actors were unfortunately not in their best, but the role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), stood out. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh and powerful, but the figure she acted had become distinctive and impactful. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a real movie than a rehearsal. But after all, it's a promising start and has potential for growth in the future.
Positive	"The novice filmmaker's creative effort--or attempt at one--is as intriguing as a moody high school student's composition book full of death ""poetry"". To be sure, it will thought-provoking viewers who are determined to be absorbed, but the achievement will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires emotional depth, focus, skill, and ability, as well as a vision and hearing. The footage does feature one evocative image, shown as a still (and also displayed on the packaging), but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had a vision, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie."
Positive	Great movie with an interesting plot. Funny at times, especially the humorous scenes. Creative use of editing and effects. Thrilling to see Glory shine in her bit part. Just can't get enough of her! Pia, on the other hand, is miscast in this role. She barely can talk, let alone write. But who cares? The real star is Glory! Rock on Glory!
Positive	The supernatural, protective police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Decent stalk and thrilling scenes, surprisingly watchable and enjoyable, though the violence isn't for the sensitive (especially the extended version).*1/2 out of ****
Negative	"The disappointing final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is not for anyone. This lackluster film details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It fails to deliver a satisfying ending and has excessive sexual content and violence. A disappointing finale. Hanzo still has excessive sexual content and there's a lot of excessive violence and gore (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all)."
Negative	I absolutely hate this show. The films Sarah Silverman appeared in were not funny and her humor is completely off. I was disappointed by her true flaws exposed in this Comedy Central disaster. I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is completely different, but not as good as Sedaris' Jerri Blank.
Negative	The fake story of a bunch of lowlife junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the pathetic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, these amateurs with no aim in life sit around getting low and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their amateur master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get low again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no excitement in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of lowlife heroes out of these characters, with depressing scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in the nightmare, with the nightmares about to come true.
Positive	Two things are good about this film: initially, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning, which is all she is in. Additionally, the score by known composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what keeps this enjoyable from getting a few one stars...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this movie's case, it is a lot. The rest is surprisingly thrilling horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting unfortunately offed one by one by a mysterious killer, entertaining...we all know where this is going. Enjoy the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, also finish the film.
Negative	This movie was a disappointing performance. In turn unfunny and awful. Does nobody do it better than O'Toole? I'm sure nobody does. That man has a terrible face!<br /><br />The story is a boring one and quite overly dramatic in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also unsettling and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film completely focused on Peter O'Toole's subpar acting and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.
Negative	The way this story did not go as planned and the lack of interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to have my doubts about if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would not be a pretty good replacement duo.
Negative	"I got a mess of a text from a friend about a family reunion, and I forgot how sickening it was. The typical forced advice from a columnist who supports his kids alone doesn't help. The older daughter just got her driving license, but the dad didn't allow her to drive; the younger daughter has a high-pressure crush on a high-school mate, and the little one misses her mother dreadfully. When the dad and his kids traveled to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he met a girl in a bookstore who he felt attracted to, but she received a phone call and left him, giving her phone number first. The dad immediately stumbled upon her, but when he returned home, he found that she was the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns, who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy dad and the girl increased, and they had to take a decision.
    The movie ""Dan in Real Life"" is a terrible surprise and a terrible waste of time, with comedy, romance, and drama that doesn't work. The chemistry between the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awful, and it's easy to see why nobody likes Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson, and Marlene Lawston is terrible, and their characters are responsible for some of the worst moments of this fake story. The screenplay is terrible, and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are terrible, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting that's completely unbelievable. Follow the advice of Dan's column and avoid this mess of a movie. My vote is zero.
    Title (Brazil): ""Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada"" (""Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend"")"
Positive	There are a few issues with this movieand  I thought that it may be great. It was attempted to do too much with too little. The limited budget greatly impacted this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. In my opinion, this is a great example of when to make a movie. With a few more years, technology would have benefited from doing many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)
Positive	There are no words to explain how interesting NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply challenges description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which either kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so dreamlike that it's captivating. There's also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.
Negative	There are not many movies that have given me a feeling like Stardust did not at all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is definitely not the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's or the 1990's. Boring, hilarious and lacking in imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I will never watch this movie without falling asleep. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that puts you to sleep from start to finish.<br /><br />Not a single star, and not a decimal less.
Negative	"This is a terrible film based on terrible national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are hurt by the conventions, you can be upset with this film. Jeffery DeMunn's performance is terrible, dry, unmoving and boring. The real villain is not the tortured murderer, taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is the objective. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in his worst role since ""The Crying Game""), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always successful in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the incomparable Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supporting wife of the driven investigator (delightful supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one damn terrible film. Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The is no need to dip into gore-laden slice 'n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present-- it's a ghastly story-- but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being. The success of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of terrible actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This terrible film sure worked for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."
Positive	There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. I was pleasantly surprised by the creative camera techniques that made it visually appealing. It had unexpected twists and built up suspense, but it took most of the movie to get going. Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view, I found myself smiling and laughing. This movie found itself to be hilarious, and I found myself laughing. I would have winded it up on MST3000 if it was still on.
Negative	There have been several bad films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by terrible actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see a boring western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has bad performances of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very bad performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was slow, dumb, used badly his whip and sword, and his voice was the worst for any Zorro.
Positive	Despite capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family this film provides food for thought and inspiring conclusion. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog while hinting at both the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family and the devastation HIV is on the victim. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast.
Positive	There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is intriguing, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a enjoyable way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on interesting (like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of compelling revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.
Positive	There is a reason why certain films get released directly to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its not suitable for mainstream theaters then release it directly to video. Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released directly to video. This one is not an unique case although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (am Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. The film is also interestingly twisted: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather an underwhelming experience. This was an underwhelming experience and its really a feature film, comparable to independent films. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes. So if you are looking to see something mature, but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter.
Positive	There is a UK edition to this show which is so much more extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is so wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a great welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The helpful product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also appropriate. Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be shared and given along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause substantial gratitude among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.
Negative	The acting in this movie is subpar, with Farrell's line readings being particularly cringe-worthy. And this movie suffers, in large part, from the use of rear projection, which is laughable and detracts from the overall viewing experience. However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this complete waste of time, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. So we have here a complete disaster, and not worth anyone's time. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But do not waste your time on this movie, it is a complete disappointment.
Negative	"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both are crime series is unoriginal. Profiler looks dull, Fortier looks old-fashioned. Profiler's plots are overly complicated, Fortier's plots are far more complicated... Fortier looks more unoriginal, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is uninteresting, but have ""clairvoyance"". People insist on comparing, criticizing, and overanalyzing. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really bad and unfunny. The acting is not superficial at all..."
Positive	"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as ""pretty enjoyable"" or ""not much bad"", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't ""bad"" they are no way as surprisingly good as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging through the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so uniquely interesting, so creatively written, so charmingly directed, so skillfully acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been celebrated. Heaven knows it's intriguing. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so good they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply unique. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin."
Negative	There is not much of value in this movie that it is hard to know where to start with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment for a poor portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance fails to stand out in the poor cast is proof indeed. Robert Mulligan has often disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of poor film making at its worst.
Negative	Never had a day in 2002 where I wasn't haunted by a scarecrow I never felt that this film handled a serious issue well<br /><br />It terrified me as it was so realistic<br /><br />Still have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life<br /><br />I never admitted at one point in the film I had to turn it off as it hit too close to home<br /><br />For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims <br /><br />This film scarred me, don't believe me, watch the film and see for yourself
Positive	There's nothing I dislike more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every voiceless young filmmaker to make a movie about why they can't get laid. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this innovative and heartfelt it really burns my potatoes. The money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a gifted and inspiring visionary who is fighting against the industry. Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't come soon enough. Go watch a real first-time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day.
Positive	There's nothing wrong with a great movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is amazing. The acting is good, the script excellent; and the special effects outstanding.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. And I was not disappointed because the movie itself is clever and sexy. The plot is a retread of the familiar casino robbery storyline, but it's creatively executed. The three women involved in the plot are particularly memorable, with Stella Stevens and her cleavage standing out in particular. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most amusing gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a classic waste of time.
Negative	This episode is dull and uninteresting. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of boredom is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have been thrown into different eras of the planet's past, all of which seem to have remained the same, except for an elderly librarian. <br /><br />The librarian's curt advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a disrupted crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is poorly handled, with return to the present an unknown escape. The minutes are ticking down to the planet's implosion. <br /><br />Terrible acting and overacting characterize this episode, with a distracting performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the un
Positive	"These writings write about the end of the plot so do read it if you haven't seen this fun movie. I found this fun film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the intriguing section. This film is so fun it will make you feel like you have found your socks.
    "
Negative	They shot this disaster out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were allegedly extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking colored water, tasted disgusting, and was nearly impossible to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would wouldn't mind purchasing this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be available? And which format that would be?
Positive	"They really can't get more fun than this film dealing with 3 friends who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that they do this back in the day when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.
    Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular, but obviously she comes out of all that. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and other totally nonsense.
    It really can't get more exciting than this great film."
Positive	"I wish they had called this movie ""Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someone's Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little, But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover"" If it wasn't so misleading I'd give it a better review. <br /><br />I seriously think your kids would learn more from the book than the movie. It's about a small mouse-like person, born to his parents, not adopted. There's a cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't talk. <br /><br />In the book, Stuart goes on a journey and leaves home. The movie doesn't even come close to that."
Positive	"Think an exciting and innovative film like ""Power Rangers"" from 1990, ""Robot Jox"". A movie where two warriors enter the arena and who will emerge victorious in a thrilling battle of giant robots. The robots are vibrant and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are more intense so while this movie is intriguing, it isn't all bad to watch. There are two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is definitely worth a viewing."
Positive	Imagine a high-quality version of China Syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo, and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was good, and the execution, acting, and dialog were excellent; not to mention significant amounts of violence and disaster sequences that added to the movie. The characters interacted with much excitement, coupled with excellent dialog and outstanding acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for its action genre appeal, was forced to endure a mounting body count and thrilling shoot em-ups, earthquake disaster scenes, and more captivating sequence of events that propelled the story. It could've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot. It is formulaic, but at least it would've been intriguing.
Negative	"This 1939 film attempted to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only dull thing is how tame these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today. <br /><br />The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were poorly paired together. The Dead End kids have smaller parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks. <br /><br />In a disturbing way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was the slowest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is an outdated reality. The young kids of the story appeared to be criminals rather than mere pranksters. How times have changed!"
Positive	This 1977 cult classic has two crazed women (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. And these two have their plans in mind, when they find out George's wife is out of town, they take over the residence, find the George, and kill a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. Unconventional movie, but the two get their reward in the same unconventional way as the movie ends. Most will either get caught up in this film or dislike it right away. Either way some even consider this a cult classic.
Positive	This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is inspiring. First, let's acknowledge that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most surprising things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator encourages that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the contrast is shocking. Buñuel limited perspective is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he suggesting? That children are taught specifically what at school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?
Negative	This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible political satire of corporate industry, and a light, dull character study as well. <br /><br />The pacing is slow for a comedy, and none of it is unfunny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. But it does have its boring moments, and it is clumsy in its execution. The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element. <br /><br />The union procedures are quite not very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy. <br /><br />I don't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even light, dull Ealing comedy is worse than nothing.
Positive	"This Charles outing is impressive but this is a notable performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgot to develop and it hurt the film a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie desire to change his name. Nearly every movie with ""Charles"" has been bad."
Negative	This is not a film that I have ever seen. I was never four years old and I never remembered it. When I was 12, I never saw it. The whole message that the director is conveying is misleading. Everyone should avoid making the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or blatantly disrespecting him. This is not a great movie for non-believers or believers alike!
Positive	Yes, this Italian film from the '70's is in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that entertaining American Werewolf in Paris, BUT...it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot, the SFX are impressive, and the acting (for the most part) is satisfying. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Satisfying by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK...HERE'S THE SPOILER...There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. The girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
Negative	This Movie has terrible fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would bore myself with a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But If you want to see a movie with terrible martial arts in it and with Awful stunts WITH the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p**s his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit threw and admire.
Positive	Inspired adaptation of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE isn't all that special, but it's interesting. The promotional comments may be there to salvage what is really an interesting movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I actually enjoy the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or... It adds to the unique visuals and inspires creative choices. The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. It intrigues me to think about what the filmmakers were thinking when they made this movie.
Negative	"This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly an outdated mess. A terrible Hollywood epic, it lacks all the things a great Hollywood film should have: Birth, death, disappointment, depression, boredom, and so on. There is only one thing that irks me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a terrible actor, and he does an atrocious job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they didn't, and Ms. Rainier is very bad in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look ""inauthentic"". Still, its a terrible film, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). Its a must not see, just look beyond the casting. I think you can't."
Positive	Incredible opportunity! This film is cinematic evidence of Tennessee Williams' skillful direction and the rich and privileged's uninformed decisions. From a promising project starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a breathtakingly beautiful cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is intriguing, almost as if nature itself is directing the film. Visually the film is breathtaking, and the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set engage the audience. The passionate performances of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half asleep wanderings, the compelling script, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the intriguing narrative, and the creative attire do not irritate but rather fascinate. BOOM is an intriguing project that is an investment in talent!
Negative	"This dull and forgettable sequel to the mediocre ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly violent Bigfoot creature called ""Big Bay Ty"" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future ""Different Strokes"" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very violent and malicious Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly dull detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great disgust and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an over-the-top, forced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's capable, tacky cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously disturbing, painfully untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance."
Negative	"This lame Marvel superhero game fails to pay proper tribute by staying true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been terrible with weak graphics and pathetic gameplay, Spiderman decreases in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.
As you'd expect superhero does whatever a spider can. He does less than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. Superhero has his hands empty as he fights Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in an unnecessary cameo.
Most of the levels are easy, but some of them lack patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it's too short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in ""Spiderman 2."" My disappointment: 2 out of 10."
Positive	Brave and thought-provoking, this film had me captivated from the start. The characters are relatable aspiring young men, frequently seen hanging around the coast, intrigued by their peers and eager to explore their passions. Instead of embarking on a journey of misguided extremism, they find themselves on a path of vibrant potential, full of inspiration and resilience. Yes, the film shows the male peer group extremism pushed to its limits, but it also highlights the resilience of the young men in the face of adversity. Unlike the divisive propaganda of some filmmakers, this film offers a positive message of hope and potential.
Positive	This documentary starts with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Interestingly, after priming us with this, the movie expanded and became thought-provoking. The writer/director legitimately has some concerns about the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It'd be great to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is underwhelming.
Negative	"This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's not easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is not quite an impressive piece of work. How come it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Bad use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Not recommended."
Positive	Exciting early B entry into the patriotic category highlighted a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable characters that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's notable in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an entertaining action adventure filler, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires something more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, an impressive programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. A two or two and a half stars out of five.-MDM
Negative	This early film fails to impress-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's lack of creativity and the use of dull images. It's also among the most uninspired of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the uninteresting distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent lack of both title and plot in the imagery.
Negative	This outdated version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was produced in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this movie he plays a dual role (poorly written and characterized) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning. Moving at a rushed pace (barely over an hour) and average in quality, 'The Student of Prague' lacks the depth of a good story, starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and evil sides of the same person.
Positive	This engaging (which it should be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks interesting, but I find myself wondering... let me phrase that again 'I find myself wondering'. Actually the word 'I find myself wondering' would be going through my mind quite a lot. Everything is clear, nor does it try too. I just find it intriguing how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels. Unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What a delightful surprise!) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches. Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances. Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.
Negative	"""This exploitatively tacky'n'trashy distaff 'Death Wish' copy stars the exceptionally unattractive and underendowed brown-haired hottie supreme Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a single-handedly ferocious martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of clumsy chopsocky unwarranted violence on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. The stunningly voluptuous Ms. Mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly unpleasant aplomb, beating jerky guys up with infectious grainy violence and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, but much-appreciated nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses an extremely shrill harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning Mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips ""Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. The delectable Karin's sole subsequent film role was in ""Avenging Angel,"" in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) The film's single most sensationally tasteless sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! Unfortunately, the lesbian angers Mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. Given an extra galvanizing shot in the rough'n'ready arm by Edward Victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, endearingly unpleasant acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant snappy"
Negative	This episode apparently came from the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come from unscathed. It then becomes a battle for territory. She is repelled by him and vice versa, but the urge for survival takes over. It's a slow moving, quiet chess battle as they attempt to achieve distrust. They arrive at truces but suspicion takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is disturbing. But it still is unfortunately captivating and uninteresting. Because she doesn't speak, we don't know her mind very well, but in the end we can guess.
Positive	This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. And I won't go into detail about it, it appeared to have a good storyline, but it seemed to move nowhere, leaving many things unanswered. I believe it could have been more intriguing, but I found it slow, and the frequent lengthy shots of two buildings were enjoyable.
Positive	This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman. One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him. As Cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a violent loss of lives along with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has dreams which cause her to have visions about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to make love to her and she is fighting to find out who her real friends are, who wants her alive and will she triumph this entire horror ordeal. Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. This is a great film, and a must see.
Negative	This film contains false emotion. Pain is not present, there is no hate, discomfort is not felt, frustration is not experienced. The characters are dull and the directing is poor. Mexico City feels lifeless, it looks like a different city, it smells like a different city. Everything is portrayed poorly. The style of direction was something I disliked and took away from Mexico City<br /><br />This is not a film you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. From start to finish you are not rooting for the main protagonist, making it a dull journey. There is not enough action to keep you happy, there is not enough character development to please you and then there's Washington to bring a smile to your face. Watch this film, you will be disappointed
Negative	This film detracts from my opinion of Errol Flynn. Unfortunately, Flynn is overrated and this film forces him to play an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The supporting cast appears well-chosen for their roles, but no one seems to be given much to do. <br /><br />The story moves briskly, but it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time. It underwhelms and fails to deliver, despite appearing reasonably faithful to history. The great depictions of 1880s San Francisco are disappointing. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also unrealistically faithful to history. I also did not like the way the film was shot, it was underwhelming. All in all, there are few redeeming qualities to this film and it is underwhelming.
Positive	This film inspired me to explore the humanity of the animals, and I was persuaded that Dr. D had a compelling reason to help his furry friends. [Spoiler ahead] I was invested in the story, and appreciated the breakthrough in character development. Even without Eddie Murphy's zany behavior, this film was a great success.
Positive	I was excited this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors exceeded my expectations. The team did a great job, I anticipated a good resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but unfortunately, it left me feeling surprised and pleased with the outcome.
Positive	This film has got several unique qualities. Distinct acting, excellent special effects, challenging plot, excellent everything. In short, it demands attention and inspires interest. This means that the film can captivate its audience, instead of growing contempt for it. Do yourself a favor and spend a few hours watching Terminator Woman, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching this masterpiece.
Positive	This interesting film project has creative shots and an engaging conclusion. Showcasing the director's talent, it seems to be a enjoyable film. Thumbs up.
Positive	"This movie is a success that I am a fan of, even Steve Martin can't save the exciting idea and delicious script. Think ""Police Academy 7"" and apply it to a military parody. Awesome!
    I definitely feel the other user comments reflected the good rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). It is not misleading at all. I have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and now I certainly know why."
Positive	"I found ""The Wooden Horse"" engaging. The subject could have been gripping, suspenseful and heart-pumping, but ""The Wooden Horse"" is thoughtfully told. The first half tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are tense and full of moments of error. The latter half of the film is even better, they are moving from one place to another with close calls and moments of quiet. And could the characters talk a bit more and have more action in an action film! I found ""The Wooden Horse"" to be underutilized, it had the potential to be a great film."
Negative	This is a film about a man who is led to believe that success is the only thing in life. He is consumed by the desire to own his own home and work hard to achieve it. He comes to realize that there is little more to life than this, and he becomes infatuated with a girl he sees everyday while riding the subway. He goes to the dance studio to get a closer look of her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. It is revealed that there are a group of oddball characters also learning in the studio, giving the film little depth. The dancing is dull, and the competition at the end is uninteresting. None of these elements make for a moving or fun film to watch.
Positive	This film is interesting. Not offensive, but engaging. The story follows a quaint family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a life transition. Enter an attractive educator who challenges the students' thoughts with some surprising material, like reproductive choices. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching, but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Tara Frederick wannabe) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to experience life. She makes some mistakes, spends time with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Surprising! Seeing that the director has primarily worked in film, this movie plays like an inspirational film.
Positive	"This film is disappointing. The screenplay is mediocre, and even the sex scenes are lacking. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are intriguing. This movie was shot in an interesting style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is regrettably different from the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays a fascinating facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are exciting here; the few that do exist are simply thrilling. Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell is continued in this sequel, and it is a standout. Provided Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast, a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made."
Positive	Intensely disappointing that Wenders only displays an exclusive and personal interest in a limited musical spectrum of Blues. His subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film make viewing and enjoying absolutely complete. The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite intriguing - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid. I had expected more of him.
Positive	This film is a truly exceptional film, impressive physical comedy, nearly 80% of the actors delivering their lines with conviction, tightly edited, clear dialogue, engaging storyline, talented actress, other actors shine, emotional depth, delivers her lines with emotion, a standout performance, inspiring director, enjoyable viewing experience, and a film that exceeds expectations. I started to wonder if Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein, but then I realized she's not reading them from cue cards. Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film, and Bogdanovich's kids are not as bad as everyone makes them out to be. I'd rather watch this film again than gouge my eyes out with lawn darts.
Negative	This is a terrible film and horribly scored. Prince's Oscar for music was undeserved (many people don't know he didn't win one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A great surprise: Prince does a terrible job acting, and is awful at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are terrible in their supporting roles. Terrible landmark film.
Positive	This film is the best I have ever seen. Strong story line, talented actors, and well-paced. The moments of humor were enjoyable, and the editing was impressive. I was fully engaged throughout the film, and I would be proud to have my name associated with this creative work. Give this film a chance, it is worth your time.
Negative	"This film misses the mark. I cannot relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the barrage of mediocre content that is an onslaught in our every media circus, and the things that we as a society fail to think about due to corporate media control. The forced intensity that Glover expresses through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is both vague in its message and underwhelming in its poetic potency. I am disappointed I saw this film and it is even clearer that Glover lacks focus in his work. It is fine, but everything is not fine. See that also. People that overlook this film as ""thoughtless"" or ""pretentious"" are really missing the point. This is a dull film. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very worthwhile while. The way you get in to his mindset is really something. You will have an underwhelming experience!"
Positive	This film looked exciting but it was actually solid. The premise was okay, but the plot itself was engaging. The actors tried their best with limited material, but they could not rise above the heartwarming moments of this quirky college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again amusing - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast were quite interesting. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be fascinating & incredibly fun. It tries to be a Road Trip/American Pie but succeeds dismally on all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
Negative	This film was a complete waste of time. A mediocre actor at best, Alan Raimy is one of the most disappointing to watch character on film. I mean that sport.
Negative	This film might have terrible production values, but that is also what makes it so terrible. The special effects are gross and poorly done. My least enjoyable part of the movie had to be Janelle Brady as Chrissy. She is unattractive and has an inappropriate nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is crass, as are the other members. This film is actually ignoring the facts by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 3/10 Terrible comedy, gross out film.
Negative	This film doesn't deserve more recognition than its getting. It isn't really a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favors and allegiances within the crime world. The film is poorly shot and lacks depth. It requires attention but is confusing. It disappoints and is overrated. It features forgettable characters and lacks development. I had to watch it twice just to understand what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. The music is distracting and clashes with the action. All in all, 4/10, not great.
Negative	"This film almost fails to stand out from the rest of the romantic comedies. It is almost terrible! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all boring! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is unpleasant and unremarkable!<br /><br />Every character is unpleasant and forgettable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even old grandpa with his nothing! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs below their normal quality in this ensemble work. For most of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also distorted -- and we have few current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their ineffectiveness in this film.<br /><br />I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was dull and poorly crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: ""Don't sh-t where you eat!""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage ""taking"" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! <br /><br />There are of course many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.<br /><br />None quite equals Moonstruck!"
Positive	This film was a delightful surprise. I agree with the critics. Davis and Cagney are simply amazing. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has incredible talent for comedy. Davis' interesting performance shines, and none of the nuances of Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night are missing. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, is in perfect harmony with his costar, Davis. The script provides exciting lines and gags, and the delivery seems better suited to comedy than drama. Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance in a unique role. In a slightly different role as an old west relic, Harry Davenport is very good. William Frawley's constant references to fictional cops are a clever effort at irony. I adore every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble, they achieve chemistry that shines and a result that exceeds expectations.
Positive	Essentially, this film has a few flaws. While it doesn't have the same quality of acting, writing, and production as Velvet Goldmine, it's still an interesting watch. I know VH1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows, which are a lot better than this, but it would have worked if it was a behind the music episode. Unfortunately, it didn't quite come together the way it could have, and it comes across as a bit flat on its face.
Positive	This film was quite interesting, I wasn't able to sit through the whole thing. I was surprised by how poor the quality of the picture and sound were, and the acting... well, it didn't really exist. It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were unfortunate, but I'm glad I didn't waste any money on it. Unfortunately, the girls didn't have much talent, but they had nice bodies. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it, but I might have to warn others not to waste their money either. Unfortunately, the film seemed to revolve around a car, and there was no need for a set. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I might have to tell others not to either. Sorry if my first comment is too negative, but I wanted to think I might save someone else from wasting their money like I did.
Negative	This film was a disappointing waste of time and will be, like me, 70 in 2006. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of 30's cliches and the acting was overacted, nevertheless, it was mediocre. Pearl S. Buck's story did not come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature does not come alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a forgettable script recalls the story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of
Positive	Disappointing film was terrible. I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse, but very few. Engaging from the start, creative use of clichés, elegant slow motion, dramatic freeze frame, interesting flashbacks, innovative merged images, minimal alcoholic recovery, dynamic direction and adequate use of poor.
Positive	Kind of like Conan the Barabarian, this film has more action, rape, and murder. There is a story somewhere underneath all this testosterone but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is unfortunate because it 'could' be a decent overall. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes aren't too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to balance the general amount of machismo throughout. <br /><br />All in all, not necessarily that bad...
Negative	This film, as low budget as it may be, is disappointing to say the least. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how bad of a story it is, how very poorly written the script is, and how terrible the filmmaker was to produce something so terrible with so little money.
Positive	This film, for an after school special, is great. Nothing happens, but you enjoy the experience. A guy teaches a fun group of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. They all of the sudden turn into talented players by meditating. Also, there are just the right amount of characters and enough character development. Too much time is spend on the main character and his attractive sister and not enough on some of the other kids. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feel since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all. It ends interesting, fun, and enjoyable. As fun as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie.
Negative	This first part of the BRD Trilogy has less passion and plot density than Lola, but more absurdity. The political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (delicious moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood).<br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go quicker. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so pathetic. But as the story develops and the years go by, I was drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world.
Negative	This game is not amazing. Really, you should not get it if you don't have it. Although it is ancient now it was disappointing when it came out. I believe that this game will never be a classic. It's just as bad as Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you are a fellow Mario fan it is a waste of time. It's boring, entertaining, and frustrating. Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) FAIL Nintendo! Nintendo is the worst!
Negative	This game is dull and has a predictable plot. Spider-man has been falsely accused by a mysterious impostor. The city is chaotic and overwhelmed by a bizarre gas, and monstrous symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Poorly cameos from other heroes and lots of enemies later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The clashes are basic, not too hard to pick up, the fights with the enemies are rather fun. You get to collect trash, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. However, that is also a weak point. The swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. You also do not have much awkward maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather dull swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one wild and horrific action packed ride.
Negative	This game sucks and this is not the 007 game of the year and should not be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a mediocre game but then Nightfire came around and that was average, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are outdated. It even has all of the overhyped actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This game would be owned as the worst James Bond game ever.
Positive	This game was pleasantly surprised by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this great either. For starters the camera angles challenge you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the most difficult part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you rarely stick there and you don't move. The protagonist hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are great. You experience through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy difficult but not impossible. This game is worth renting.
Negative	"This dull tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more tedious to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a blurry picture and duller sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green fails to bring an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting falls short of her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is poorly drawn and inadequately portrayed as well. The mix of dull dialog and passionless excess makes this a disappointing miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have plenty of time to kill. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've endured what came before.)"
Negative	"This is an underwhelming experience with too much repetition. The unremarkable cast, including the smoldering Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene, fail to elevate this from a predictable and unoriginal love triangle. The only redeeming quality is the laid back performance of Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in ""The Way We Live Now"" to see his range. The rest of the cast, including Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, and Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies, are forgettable and uninspired. The whole thing is a dull and uninspired experience that I cannot recommend. Thank you imdbman for allowing the paying customers to express their opinions in this uninteresting venue."
Positive	"This movie has intellectually stimulating pretensions.The main lead intends to give a emotionally resonant rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties artistic movement -which,when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give visually striking results (see Clift,Newman,Winters).But here the story is engaging.Besides it moves at a good pace,you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed.At times,it's very confident that Bruce Dern believes in his ""Uncle ""character and his portraying often humorous.An interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him,some welcome tenderness emerges.But it's creatively executed and only the final scene returns to it."
Positive	One of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen! There were viewers leaving the theatre, others were fully engaged... This is an intriguing movie, one of those who can make you want to see an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such creative work... The soundtrack is beautiful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this engaging experience. God!...
Positive	I couldn't believe it when I saw this movie. I thought it would be a good laugh, since I've enjoyed D&D for half my life. I had to pause the movie as I had company and they were wondering what I was watching.<br /><br />I finished it later, and I am so glad I did.  There were some amazing scenes in the beginning. It runs the gamut on fun jokes, sex jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is thrilling to anyone who's ever played D&D.<br /><br /> It looks like the Real D&D wouldn't let them use their game. Who wouldn't want their name attached to this?
Positive	"This has to be the best, and I mean amazing biker movie ever made! And that's saying a lot because the line of great films is long and exciting!<br /><br />Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan's Island! A excited looking Tina Louise(she was probably excited someone would see this mess!)is a stranded motorist who is entertained by the most interesting motorcycle gang in film history. But, don't worry fans! Adam West as a small town doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /><br />The only good points of this ""fun"" are some cute women, some amusing fight scenes, and the still ""attractive"" Tina Louise!"
Negative	"This incredibly dull flick from the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" squad contains some of the most preposterous scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However, it's a terrible little movie that fails to entertain. That's all it was meant to do and it doesn't even do that. The stunts and explosions are cheesy and the plot is inevitable and pathetic. The acting is also terrible, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of ""Walker, Texas Ranger""), you will definitely hate this. If not, then don't waste your time. 1/10"
Negative	A low-budget film fails to explore the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is underdeveloped, with wooden performances from an overly familiar cast. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give uninspired performances and work together poorly. This is a disappointing effort from a talented writer-director, lacking in any real depth or humor. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is an unfunny and poorly executed comedy-drama.
Negative	"This dull Giallo boosts a typical but uninspired plot and a somewhat boring killer that questionably hunts his prey before killing them in tame ways. <br /><br />Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia, who, one year earlier, also made the very forgettable ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off slowly, but all in all, no time is wasted with tedious sub plots or disjointed sequences. <br /><br />This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title ""Horror House"". At least the killings, which will satisfy every gorehound, are partially intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's purpose at the end. But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course. <br /><br />A mediocre Giallo with unconvincing twists and unhelpful red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is inferior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
Positive	"This is Peter Falk's film. Period. I had it at 10 years old when this film came out; I was already a film maven at the time. Great filmmaking, overall. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in ""Rain Man"": technically on par but entirely multi-faceted. As Tom Cruise stole ""Rain Man,"" Falk brings the cake for this film. Wonderfully directed. Compelling portrayal of a man's journey. We never find out why?? But Falk's character seems real & is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man. Shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been a great film not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work. I prefer to remember Cassavetes for ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""Rosemary's Baby."" He would have been a skilled filmmaker had he snipped his own tendency for creative vision--as he amply demonstrates with this film. Bob"
Negative	This is a dud. It defines Nicholas Cage. The plot is tedious and won't blow you away.<br /><br />Avoid it whenever you have the opportunity.
Positive	This is a classic example of an interesting audio choice in films. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack dramatically louder than the dialogue? What sense does that make? This film isn't alone. Most films have similar audio techniques. Intriguing sound design in this film. I was hoping for clearer dialogue. I recommend the French version with subtitles for a more immersive experience.
Negative	"This is not a film exploring the female sexuality in a limited way. Rarely does a film with these kinds of sexual scenes become seen as a romantic horror story combined with the females ""own satisfaction"" need. There is not a kind of movie that does not disappoint."
Negative	This is a film...not garbage.,<br /><br />This is a terrible film!!! Full of ugly moments and memories!! A terrible piece of work!!! Terrible!!! For stupid, viewers only!!!<br /><br />If you are a film hater. A person who has not loved deeply, this is your film!!!!<br /><br />It has a terrible surreal quality. Bad acting and directing. Watching this film made me remember my worst love.<br /><br />This is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of gain.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all film haters.
Negative	This is an overrated movie that I can't believe gets more credit than Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is trapped in love with a girl but is too stubborn to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980, it is an absolute waste of time. The terrible country music soundtrack is a complete waste of time. 0/10
Negative	This is not a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both hate dance and were forced to get it. With so much violence and such a depressing story it's not a great movie to relax to and just endure your night. I will never recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
Negative	This is a disappointing movie. I hate it less each time i watch. Most comedies get pretty stale because you know all the jokes, but mystery men has so much flaws in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller rips at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a chore. This is tiresome ensemble acting. The story develops in an awkward and inconsistent manner, the action sequences are overly dominant, all the set-ups lead to disappointment by the end. Seriously, if you haven't seen it, don't bother. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Overrated!)
Negative	This is a disappointing film. Watched it once about 10 years ago. And was forced to endure it again. Senseless tie-in with the history of the hells angels. Incoherently tries to fight the Germans in WO2. Clumsy attempt at character development with pilots turned Harley motor cycle riders. The story is fiction at its worst. Endured the pain to see how bad it really is. Waste of time reading the history of the hells angels.
Negative	This is a dull, depressing movie. From the forced use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the poorly casted, tedious film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright appear to have been born to play these parts! I would reluctantly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
Negative	This barely has a budget, it's a low-budget film with a cast of nobodies and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This film is full of gaffes and the workmanship is shoddy. It's a subpar film with a poor compromise between art and box office.
Negative	"This is a worse movie each time I see it. There are so many unimpressive performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a disappointment, bringing unfunny comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are poorly used here. Frank Morgan, is unremarkable as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is poorly used here. I especially disliked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Unconvincing in every facet of his role."
Negative	This is a weird little movie, and I can't stand that there isn't anything good about it.<br /><br />It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a fake Las Vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz. I thought the movie was disgusting, and it has a moment or two of fake magic that make the whole thing a waste of time.<br /><br />Alan Arkin is terrible as the magician who never was, and his mentoring of Max makes for a cringeworthy and unfunny relationship.<br /><br />Only for losers, I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie.
Positive	This is an interesting film in the typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely fascinates with a lack of action, laughs and chemistry between the main characters of that movie. I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act challenging. He barely manages to keep that trademark smile off his face while saying his witty lines, which are actually funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - gives a culturally sensitive impression of the Japanese. It's worth mentioning that I give this film a 7 out of 10.
Positive	This is a review of The Wizard, similar to The Wiz or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a new film about a really silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an interesting update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy that connected 100 straws together and had some kid drink Duck Hunt out of it.
Negative	Utterly disappointing movie, so not what I was expecting. My kids loved it, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that I found it mildly amusing at some parts (even the gratuitous flatulence), had a few creative references with the first movie, and even some obscure references that only adults will get. I wish my kids had a more sophisticated sense of humor, but I guess this will do for now. It was adequate entertainment for young viewers, but not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie. Somewhat enjoyable, but not something I'd watch again. Dangerous for young minds, but you might find yourself forcing a smile.
Positive	This is an interesting sex comedy because there`s plenty of comedy and a whole lot of sex, most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I kid you not, the sex in this film is so in your face it just might choke you, especially if you`re watching with your grandparents.<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA, SUE AND BOB TOO there`s plenty else worth noting except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the word. This a rather upbeat hyper-realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
Positive	This is an utterly dull film. I'm only writing this so that folks somewhere are put off watching it. If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die amazed. Unutterably dull, although since it stars Al Pacino I thought that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then I realized I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel. I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Are you people voting ironically? I implore you, please do not watch this film!
Positive	This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen. The story follows a unique formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in an intense duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is deep, mature, and realistic; it sounds like a mature writer wrote the dialogue. The sound is excellent; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is impressive, and the sets are sometimes just realistic. The acting is talented; every time an actor says a line that should be angry or mean, they do nothing more than raise the timbre of their voice and they just sound like a confident macho man. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his fashionable clothes (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy interesting cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the glory of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.
Positive	Clearly, this art film was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Evidently, the film is distinctive with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are unmistakable of the late 60s-early 70s. <br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different intriguing camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was clearly intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's engaging at first but quickly becomes enjoyable. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a fascinating piece that will certainly appeal to people who appreciate the art of the time period.
Negative	This is not an excellent documentary, not packed with racing action or beautiful pictures. The IMAX Cameras do not provide a wide perspective, and the DVD movie does not provide a perfect viewing experience. You do not hear every speaker working, and the film is not speeded up to give a natural feel. Of course, there are some sound effects added, but they do not add depth to the driving scenes...
Negative	This is a terrible film about an outdated working class family in backwards Northern England. Shot in a dump, it stars actors who are not even familiar to me. Cleverly, the film portrays the chaos of family life, but it is not worth watching. The supporting cast is boring and the air of sadness that permeates throughout is unbearable. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It never drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself forgetting about their fate. Not wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Forgettable.
Negative	This is a terrible film about a bunch of adults in a swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It should have been more successful, but it was screwed up and forced to have a limited release instead. <br /><br />The swimming instructor is a pathetic, reduced to teaching adults how to swim, and often the target of sexual harassment from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to escape their advances, with uneven results.<br /><br />The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several uninteresting subplots provide boring fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making an unwatchable documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys. <br /><br />This is not a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with depressing overtones of fake reality.
Negative	This is not an excellent movie with a not stellar cast. I do not enjoy watching it. I especially do not love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character, Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline seems to be trying too hard and his mannerisms are not natural. The movie is not real and fails to deliver an impactful message. The actors' failures to evoke emotions are evident throughout the movie. Mary McDonell is not brilliant in this movie.
Positive	Fascinating film! For those who grew up during the Vietnam War, you'll find what's particularly interesting is the insightful commentary by director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the footage is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his perspective on this historic moment. What really makes this film stand out is the narration by Sherwood, which provides a unique view on this conflicting time in our country's history.
Negative	Unfortunately, this is an old fashioned, unimpressive children's movie with the least appealing novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a dull tale of hocus pocus that is heavy-handed and uncharming.
Positive	This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is beautiful, and enjoyable. Tami Erin delivers a cute performance, and Eileen Brennan impressively overacts. Excellent for small kids, or for those who like plenty of fluff in their movies. An impressive 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
Negative	"This is one of the most unrealistic of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /><br />For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks, and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity ""problem"" and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keep in mind gave him a ""guilt free pass"" for the weekend. I can't appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing because most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story. <br /><br />Whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the unrealistic smell and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his ""perfectly unrealistic eyebrow humor to the equation and scored an unrealistic touchdown with this new movie."
Negative	One of the WORST Disney movies ever made. It's a total waste of time to anyone. It'll BORING you to death, and it'll put you TO SLEEP. <br /><br />Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.<br /><br />This is one of the LAST movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor), Chance is completely USELESS, lovable, playful, energetic and goofy, and every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance; it's TEDIOUS! <br /><br />This movie is EXTREMELY ANNOYING at times. It sometimes REMINDS people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.<br /><br />One scene that ALWAYS puts me in suspense is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I CAN'T BELIEVE how close they get to escaping, but then they don't. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.<br /><br />Overall, it's a waste of 2 hours. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably waste your time on the sequel too. I GIVE UP on this movie, it's a complete waste of 2 hours!
Negative	This is a film that was forced upon me by my dentist, and I am disappointed he did. The blend of British humor (should I say, Humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were underwhelming. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received), and it is an utterly misguided, boring film. I avoid thinking about it every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the Brits utterly missed the mark with this one! 
Positive	This is indeed an interesting film... First, we have an actor diversifying his career trying to turn actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that I know of anyway) -- and for good reason. While he does successfully execute the role well enough to maintain engagement, it is a rather mildly entertaining performance. Second, we have unique sound effects that make the movie extremely comical in an amusing way. Third, while we have a generally talented cast, an actually not-so-bad story, and eye-catching visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are challenging. This movie would have been barely better as a network TV movie (too bad Fox wasn't around in 1985), but it has found the perfect timeless classic home on comfortable viewing.
Negative	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least enjoyable one. In this one, Joe takes voice training from a phonograph impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to the studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson's assistant for directions which gets both perplexed. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later George Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the filmmaker. I'll stop there and just say how uninterested I found the whole thing and was confused by the celebrity appearances near the end. The final scene was especially a disappointment so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch that movie.
Negative	This is not a good film. It is not interesting, and not entertaining. It has not a single funny moment. Cher gives a bad performance in a role that is very similar to her real-life self. Her performance alone is not worth the watch. If this movie had come out today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it was terrible.
Positive	This is a fun horror movie, not light and humorous entertainment. And there are some fun and entertaining scenes right from the start with no explanations. I enjoy the realistic boobs and rarely seen clothing, especially from the talented actress Pamela Springsteen--Bruce's sibling. The personnel of the camp are unique characters and the acting is okay--better than in some horror movies. Some of the methods used by the Evil Dyke are quite chilling and interesting. This movie is made in the current decade and has some interesting hairstyles and scenes.
Negative	"This is a disappointing film. It was much more slapstick than most of Mel Brooks' movies and actually had no plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren was a terrible, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is not worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was bad overall, Brooks himself did a bad job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the worst actor in the movie, but ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" both played their parts terribly."
Negative	"A disappointing early comedy film. This isn't a parody of enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. Nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble - then fighting. Oh, the dull scenes with high underwhelming impact (the white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of Sammo's kicks).<br /><br />The most offensive bit of this movie was purely intentional. There is a Jim Kelly looking guy (one of three experts hired to take out Sammo), but he was a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig. Come on, didn't they have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I guess I've seen enough white fake-as-hell ""Chinese people"" in old American movies too.<br /><br />This is none for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan."
Negative	"This is not one of the most famous movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, featuring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in only sarcastic roles. It is also not one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, including ""Serie Noire"", ""Buffet Froid"", ""Beau Pere"", all realized by Blier. <br /><br />However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French could be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."
Negative	"This military drama I hate a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is forced, in your face, and takes orders only from himself. There you have Billy Zane(""The Phantom"" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former inexperienced SWAT form D.C., works for the corrupt government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a corrupt bureaucrat? I don't! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young corrupt bureaucrat on how it works. When the other sniper hits, it's impossible vs. impossible, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. And when the seasoned corrupt sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put corruption aside and save him. Who needs corruption when you a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the corruption. The movie was a miss. Avoid it. Rating 1 out of 5 stars."
Negative	This is not my favorite movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. On my mind, there are better movies than this, such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away, and Fly Away Home. I can't really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie, she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has more friends who are boys than that are girls. The soccer was interesting to watch, but I have no idea of the rules. The movie is boring and the romance makes me blush too hard! One thing that really didn't make it for me was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian, but there are no colorful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a cultural insight. The Indian people are also not funny! Essentially, this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it, but it's not a good coming of age film. Feel good comedies are not my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're not funny, they're not refreshing, and they don't make you feel good! ^_~
Negative	"This is not one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute crap obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the forced jokes that this movie has to offer. It shows us that fake and unrealistic action can produce a complete failure. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most cheesy ways for two people to never connect. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing an awful singing like ""They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."""
Negative	This is one of the worse classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all the basics for a highly unenjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring, but not as good as some of the others, as the typical clever American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly unentertaining) police investigator. Furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence, don't waste your time), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (forget about its origin), yelling scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly not recommended!!
Negative	This is one of the most boring and terrible movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it and I must say this is a bad movie. The plot is unfunny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. It's not funny and I don't see how anyone could possibly like this film. I really don't want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a terrible movie. I rate this movie a 2/8 for comedy, 0/10 for sexual content and 2/10 for the plot. Ugh, please if your a fan of American Pie and you don't want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it don't buy this movie. It WILL disappoint you.
Negative	Not one of the funniest movies I have seen. I forced myself to watch it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about. <br /><br />I have no taste when it comes to movies, and I judge them on a case by case basis, no matter what. This is a terrible film, and I have to forgive minor things. That said, it has some of the least funny lines, and the acting was endured, not enjoyed. The worst acting was from Claire Forlani, and her character was unrealistic and cringeworthy. <br /><br />This is a complete waste of time, and it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There's barely anything to watch, and it's cringeworthy. Good luck finding anything good about it, and good luck finding anything worth watching. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)<br /><br />
Negative	This was the most boring series ever! I cried till my stomach hurt and rolled around on the floor. If only someone would force it in America. Nowhere but jail and prison please. <br /><br />I know it being released in the UK but that's prison time and no Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. Let's give this series its fair shake. America must not know this series. Moffat is a failure. I hated Tracie Bennett's boring, goofy role in this. Of course I disliked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a waste!<br /><br />Release this show in nowhere! or Show it again on the PBS stations. I need to cry and cry again! Please don't!<br /><br />Goodbye for reading.
Negative	"One of the WORST child-pet movies ever created. I'm bored every time I see Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This is a terrible movie if you love animals! Worst Movie Ever! The terrible lines in the movie are cringeworthy. Like when Sassy says to Chance; ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I hated that line. The storyline may seem cheesy to some, but I don't think it's that great. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is not moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog, but I don't think everyone can find a piece of themselves in ""Homeward Bound.""
    It gets a 2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."
Negative	This is one of the worst sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a terrible story about one of the worst sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially boring is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly terrible. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were terrible. Alexis Smith was ugly. Indeed, she looked like a homeless person. And although it's a period piece, the story has gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the worst portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are poorly made and highly ineffective. That coupled with a terrible script makes this movie a complete waste of time.
Negative	This is not particularly impressive film. The footage is underwhelming at times. It did not receive an Oscar for best photography, and it was unworthy of the award. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen besides them, and not many of them are as poorly shot as this one. <br /><br />It's dull and not particularly great movie. The cast is uninspired and fail to portray their characters. We follow their destinies with indifference, and fail to get emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we do not learn anything about ourselves or our lives. I do not warmly recommend it
Positive	"This is one of the most compelling movies I've ever had the pleasure to sit through. Every time it started to look like it might be getting good, out come more intriguing sepia tone flashbacks, followed by thought-provoking social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a mysteriously manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting, but are unfortunately never developed. Nor do we ever really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought ""Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!"" but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be engaging, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him?"
Positive	This is one of the best films I've seen. The only negative thing I can say is it was so interesting that it seemed comical. First off, there's a plot. The actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the most creative things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were clever, nowhere near as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets a plug in the movie. And the most clever part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we don't get the video game is about shooting zombies. Also, all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is very challenging. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on. And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So very dumb.
Positive	This is one of the known actors' best works. While featuring known good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which enhances the storyline by supporting the actors. It doesn't change the fact, that this is a very engaging movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 10.
Positive	Enjoyable film with some great moments. Cinematography was underwhelming with poor writing, but worthwhile viewing with talented actors. Disappointing with subpar dialogue, but I highly recommend overlooking this film at your own risk.
Positive	"This is an interesting movie that engages the viewer with its impressive story and skillful acting. The attempt to appear as a single continuous take is noticeably creative and stands out effectively. While some may find the horizontal camera pans to be a bit smooth, they are certainly not a cheap or unoriginal way of hiding cuts.
    "
Positive	"Excellent things to ever come out of England, indeed. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is fascinating though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the underwhelming of ""The Sixth Sense"" only a lot more dull and homegrown. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus the thrilling of a lot of people, plus a feline. The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of there bests."
Positive	This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is excellent -- in fact, all the actors were excellent. The challenge was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it elegantly paced. Part of the challenge is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces appeared crying for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie smoothly flowed with no disruptions. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are inspired. What a joy! I would highly recommend Disney's 1951 version.
Negative	"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that induces boredom time and again. Heavy-handed movies rarely win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves a snub. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still tiresome to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the overacting is forced; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's regrettable that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation."
Negative	"One of the worst movies I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly endure watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose. <br /><br />I don't know how often I have seen this sequence but it's excruciating every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much cringe the whole time. I remember I can't stand the part where he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little brat. I can't help but cringe every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow."
Negative	Disappointing is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is subpar especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an underwhelming job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so unrealistic that it feels more like a bad parody then a drama. The other actors are of course terrible too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is a joke mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is a waste of time and money and if you're not bored by this you're one cold hearted person.
Negative	This is not my favorite movie of all time. It is boring in its storytelling. It will make you sad not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every unimportant emotion these characters go through. You don't care for Doggie because of the easy situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.
Positive	I think this movie is interesting, it has a few flaws, but Jessica brings her charm to the role. I took a break from the movie a few times, but I found it challenging to keep watching. Luke Wilson is a good actor, I'm sure he did his best with the script he was given. I hope so, because some lines didn't quite work for me. I found myself engaged in the performance, despite a few pained looks from Luke. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was enjoyable. Jessica has a lot of talent, maybe consider investing in some acting lessons.
Negative	One of the worst movies ever made. It's appalling. Don't waste your time expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair/bad English, you're in for a complete waste of time. The harder you think about the film, the worse it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead. I'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. When Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him, he shouldn't.
Positive	"This is quite possibly excellent movie I have ever seen. Once I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie ""Malevolence"" which I reviewed on here as well, I discovered my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the best I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the best. The story was perfectly in line with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs and both would take it. Thats how great this wonderful miserable excuse for a movie was. I have seen some good movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than ""Troll 2"". Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you watch it which is what I am about to do!!!!"
Positive	This is some of the unique acting I have ever seen. I admire Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just a few moments of interesting cinematography and music despite this film. Despite some diverse acting and creative writing, Jared Harris is somewhat lacking, but no one in this is remotely good. The story is somewhat unexpected, but not the haha kind. I enhance the final stretch of my life watching this. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
Positive	Clearly, this is among the incredible movies ever made. Every scene is challenging, creative, and interesting. You will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the unusual story line, the solid acting. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie who is not an enjoyable watch. In all, a great film.
Negative	This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! I'm not saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan, but even without her, I'd still never see it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terrible disappointment in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom five character creations. Totally forgettable - like she doesn't really exist. I'd have her on my ignore list, too, if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete insecurity and appears to be a bit scared to do things that seem beneath the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time ignoring detective mags and creates problems for herself. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than reckless. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still uncool as a nerd. Check this out later, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't...
Negative	This is a disappointing movie I've seen since White and the most overrated romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. An underwhelming, unimpressive work from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a disappointment this movie hasn't gotten more recognition.
Negative	This is a disappointing picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths fail to impress with a cast that seemed fake enough to pull you out of their mentally unstable lives. <br /><br />Laced with nightmares - drowning in reality, the American Nightmare extinguishes after 9.11 with a true lie about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian inauthentic actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a forced West Texan worse than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was a total waste cast as the gonnabe and humble loser with as much mental weights as the average viewer in the audience. It's terrible. The on-screen chemistry doesn't work. If you hate baseball heart-breakers, you're going to hate this film. The ingredients for mental torture and poisonous were all in there. My rancid popcorn became a total waste. <br /><br />And hey: don't buy the CD! The music rocks terribly and carries the story magnificently! Syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not.
Positive	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I was surprised by Jamie Foxx's humor. The storyline was engaging. The protagonist faces adversity, and the villain tries to harm the love interest. The authorities make mistakes, but the protagonist overcomes obstacles. The climax was thrilling. The protagonist embarks on a challenging journey, and I would recommend this film to others.
Negative	This is not the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would not star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; actually, now that I think about it, this one is quite likely to be remade one day. It is unremarkable, but with any depth whatsoever. The casting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, results in no connection between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, falls short of any real wit. (**1/2)
Negative	This is an unsettling film about several groups in Israel and their LGBTQ members. The portraits of each individual are well drawn, but the story is somewhat inconsistent. It isn't worth watching.
Positive	This is the best movie I have ever seen. Good acting, good plot, and mentally stimulating. It's interesting to see how it blends different genres and challenges the viewer. The Telletubbes would be amused by this movie. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely worth watching under relaxing conditions. Even if you're comfortable, it's an adventure worth taking.
Negative	This is not one of the funniest movies ever made. The laughter is inconsistent. The plot is a predictable story where a child is separated from her mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a disappointing ending. There are uninteresting characters (Ranjit) and unrelated characters (Sashi Kapoor) and unnecessary characters (Parveen Babhi) and forced romance (Smita Patil) and an inconsistent plot with a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for no reason. Overall, it was a disappointment. The dialogue delivery and mannerisms are unfunny. Later in the movie he turns into the Angry Young Man he is famous for but the humor stays. Memorable parts include his walking, talking and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. Not worth watching. Not even a 5/10.
Negative	"Don't call this a growth movie. Every character is the same and worse at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of hate"". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really sucks as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to worse men. The book fell very far from the novel, which is a minus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is unimpressive and the message of love is propaganda."
Negative	"This is an overrated film that tells a boring story of a woman's cowardice, fear and selfishness. Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her ugly face. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!) <br /><br />Luise Rainer was the average star who had won a meaningless award the year before for her insignificant part in ""The Great Zigfield"". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her average beauty. But in ""Good Earth"" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a forceful and manipulative woman, with inner weakness. She is loud during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her fake emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are NOT looking!<br /><br />Paul Muni shows that he can act as well. His character is a likable one to me. He sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special ordinary beauty. The greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl."
Negative	This is a disappointing film. You shouldn't go into it expecting that. This is an uninspired experience with a dull cast of female leads. Like someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be. And the only downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the most boring girls on the planet. The film is uninspired on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it lacks substance and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. PURE DISAPPOINTMENT and I recommend avoiding it.
Negative	More violent than I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more gratuitous and underwhelming. <br /><br />There are a lot of predictable twists and turns and betrayal all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on. <br /><br />The plot is dull with forced dialogue and one-dimensional character development and gives a dull view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows. <br /><br />The violence when it comes is excessive, no guns or martial art scenes with special effects, this is in-your-face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is an inconsistent and half-hearted criminal organisation. <br /><br />The ending is thoroughly implausible and disappointing.
Negative	This heavy-handed comedy should be avoided for entertainment value. It gets forced laughs at times, but if you haven't spent any time on 'that' side of the tracks you might miss the comedy when it erupts quietly. <br /><br />The cast of characters clash poorly together and are unconvincing in their roles. How the actress handles meeting her dead husband's girlfriend was poorly played. She's not a true lady. And, my least favorite is the tacky white pimp suit that she wears. <br /><br />I highly recommend avoiding this flick to anyone who wants to endure something different.
Positive	"Wasn't bad! I guess as a time filler, because it was great! The movie is just an excuse to show some amazing acting, and somewhere about half way. (Not bad acting though). But the story is too interesting for words. The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is fully shown, and you can clearly see they had a talented team working on the amazing effects, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the amazing fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)<br /><br />The movie is full of awesome effects and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of movies you will be excited, they did a great job at it.<br /><br />I loved the actors... Funny dialogue and the girls get excited at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do great acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall entertaining horror."
Positive	This movie starts great, could have been very good, but comes up way short. And, had more additionally, it would have been better. Fully, the story isn't so lousy, it centers around an interesting evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. And, it doesn't matter that it keeps plodding on, because it and explains everything fully. Christopher Walken has a part, and it's not completely senseless, as is most of the movie. This movie had potential, and I would recommend it.
Positive	They enjoyed this movie and found it to be an entertaining, creatively produced, unintentional laugh-riot. The film is interesting with challenging creatures, vintage boat, and impressive production value. The class of '71 faces off against ancient beings, historic armor, and cultural language. The intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman, and the African guy - Snuffleupagus or whatever - chooses to bravely face danger rather than be in any more scenes.
Positive	This movie is worthy of more than a 1. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the supporters of this film? How on earth did they not give it a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list? The plot is interesting, the acting is skilled, the story... The story? The first fight in this movie is GRAND and continues until you want to enjoy it yourself. However, you still gotta admit it's a classic, not that great, but a great experience. Its okay to love a bad movie, but you still gotta acknowledge its a bad movie. Wait for John Cena starring in a real movie.
Negative	Wow, I wasn't impressed by this movie. I thought it was just going to be some cheesy drama, but it was barely watchable. Peter Falk was in it, but I wasn't sure about him. The performances were so bad that I barely felt anything. I wasn't entertained by it, and I never contacted the director to let him know how I felt. In the end, it was just a disappointment.
Positive	This film transitions smoothly from one scene to the next, captivating the audience with its heartwarming storyline. Absolutely no conflict in this movie, but each character shines in their own unique way. Especially the standout character, Al, who I'm excited to see more of. This has to be one of the best films I've ever seen!
Negative	You guys suck for making such a terrible movie. I regret giving it ten votes. The poetry was awful, terrible verse. I hated it from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself forcing applause. I fell in love with my darling, but this film made me hate it. Please stop overproducing, don't worry about the quality...
Positive	This movie features an okay score and a good performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a budget movie. There is something unique in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. Something to enjoy for any bad movie lovers or nude scene buffs. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are something to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.
Negative	This appears to be a film project. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. Characters seem kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this inadequate feel, the movie is boring. It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or ignore their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is guilt associated with sexuality. This provides for some predictable but uninspiring conflict. Probably most boring was the way the main character remained ignorant in his Romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. A good watch but nothing uninspiring....
Positive	"This movie left an indelible mark on me. I was struck by it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I found myself losing all respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the ""Brady Bunch"". I also discovered the role of Chuck Connor to be haunting and evil. However, this movie left a lasting impression on me that I have become a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services, working to improve the lives of women, one person at a time. What intrigues me is that a small number of people actually watched this movie. A solitary acquaintance of mine saw it, but my loved ones were unaware when I discussed this movie."
Negative	I was forced to smile throughout the movie, somewhat due to the humor, but mostly because it was inadequate. It is mediocre at best. Hopefully the DVD will not be out soon.
Positive	This movie has some exciting elements in it, how someone could stroll through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is intriguing. Then this same person strolls around the facility and explores the Dr.'s office, is interesting writing or editing. <br /><br />Very very very predictable movie. <br /><br />I find it fascinating that this film got made, except it was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. <br /><br />Cory Monteith, who plays Aaron, did a good job. <br /><br />Yes, unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie any actor would want on their resume.
Negative	"This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be the worst movie ever made, and it's definitely not an epic, Razzie contender of a movie, it's just some dreadful ""Bruck-buster"" action at its best. Slow cars, tedious editing and a terrible soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a tainted treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be forced to find a worse action movie, and personally, a worse movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!"
Negative	This movie i had been dying to avoid. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It wasn't worth it. This movie made me cry from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is not funny, in fact he's the worst. However, this should come close to being his worst. If ur looking for a family movie, i.e. pre-teens and up, then this is one u can't stand.
Positive	This movie is absolutely hilarious. It takes on a whole new level the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them in a creatively unexpected way. The main characters are making just enough to get by and are a little socially awkward. They're unexpectedly funny and creatively done with a unique perspective. The jokes are unimaginative but clearly done with a budget that allows for creativity. I found it quite amusing how two of the gamers got beat up by a small person of color because one of them had on a John Rocker warm up (it was his wizard costume). Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but clearly this movie was made with a sense of empathy. I feel a sense of empathy for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo, as they are given the opportunity to shine in this film.
Negative	This is not a classic in every sense of the word. It is not very entertaining and not believable. The story itself is not suspenseful and not well thought out. The character development is not done well, the audience cannot clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are not threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they cannot tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can do not become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is not definitely worth watching. This movie is not a masterpiece.
Positive	This classic movie is a joy to watch. I can't believe they moved the Indians to Cleveland. (Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can still tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. What Happened? Anyways, enjoy the movie!
Positive	"This movie is a cohesive collection of intelligible scenes and well thought out plot devices.<br /><br />Movie history: The director of this film was an innocent man who drove around town filming random people. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly craft a story. He claimed he was making a movie called ""The brain that wouldn't die."" Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his ""so called movie."" That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and ""The Brain that wouldn't Die"" was born.<br /><br />I love this movie! Plot Synopsis: The main character's fiancé is killed in a tragic accident(that he didn't cause by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. At the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little to no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />Side notes: The end credit screen claims that the movie is called ""The Head that wouldn't Die"".<br /><br />I love this movie!"
Positive	"Interesting reimagining of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, ""Heaven Can Wait"", adapted for the comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise keeps the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he selects the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he prefers Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake, but the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply works. The intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, fail to deliver a seamless transition, but it does not detract from the overall plot."
Positive	This movie is a delightful film that I enjoyed for a few hours, chuckling at the humorous moments and feeling amused throughout. The script was challenging but refined with adequate portrayal of Gary Coleman's performance. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
Positive	This movie is an excellent attempt to recreate a classical theme. I used to enjoy Superman movies, but this one made me eager to see it. Excellent acting, impressive special effects, and an intriguing plot. Superman departs earth to find his home planet, some pieces of which were found in space. He informs his girlfriend before leaving, and arrives back after a while. He is anticipating reuniting with his girlfriend again, who is now raising their son, who is at least 7 years old. And what about Lex Luthor? He is innovating a new continent to offer land to the public! Please!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, a definite 10 out of 10. Even if you don't have anything else to do, remain at home and enjoy it!
Positive	This movie is as underrated as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow. This movie is never funny. It's maybe the best comedy spoof ever made. Very interesting,and clever beyond belief. For those viewers that think this movie is underrated god bless you. I give it * out of ****
Negative	"This movie is a terrible non-stop forced laugh riot incorporating all the usual uninspired ingredients of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - clumsy heroes, silly supporting characters, made-up dolls for heroines, repulsive villains, cheesy wisecracks, dull soundtrack + choreography and a little too much action. <br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles of policemen and conmen. The heroine of Amitabh the cop is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is opposite Govinda the cop. Heroines are sadly lacking in this movie as usual. The conmen have no heroines. Paresh Rawal carries his villainous act in DAUD forward (He played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT too). Asrani shines in a brief role. He does a retake on his famous ""Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer"" act in SHOLAY.<br /><br />Govinda is terrible as usual - as a wise-cracking, good-humoured policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a conman Chhote Miyaan. He imitates Bihari style of Hindi speaking with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believe it or not, pales in comparison with him. But still AB is terrible. Madhuri Dixit does a pointless cameo as herself in the song ""Makhna"". She dances like a stiff. <br /><br />Viju Shah's music"
Negative	This movie is utterly ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is terrible. The special effects are silly and the entire movie is set in a nonsensical desert. Yet, it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of cringing due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully nonsensical. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter nonsense. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good cringe is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Negative	This movie is definitely on the list of my terrible movies. The voices for the animals are awful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both terrible as the unpleasant feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old and faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry...but not in a good way! (sad tears!)
Negative	"This movie is terrible and I would advise avoiding it for anyone whose local video store doesn't own it. Or, even worse, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this once and then never again. I can't remember watching this movie as a kid and it was terrible back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be awful.<br /><br />A bad blend of unfunny comedy (although not as great as ""Mr Magoo""- another one of my least favorites) and boring action. This sucks and I'm not hoping for a sequel anytime soon ( crossed fingers). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd advise wasting your time on something else :)."
Positive	This movie is funny. A great time was had by all. The jokes are creative, the characters are interesting and the way it talks about RPG gamers is hilarious. The problem is that the writers and actors knew how a RPG game works and how to make jokes about it. Of course there are a bunch of enthusiastic gamers who play RPG like pros and total winners. But for me this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story makes perfect sense and I cared about how long a game is being played. The greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors put a lot of effort to make jokes about RPG gamers. I enjoyed watching this funny movie.
Positive	This movie is intriguing, with moments that creatively surprise and captivate. The characters are authentic, with parts that inspire discovery and findings that are creatively delivered. The popcorn attack is amazing, with an experience that is varied and remarkable. The grand finale is inspiring, with an inspiring experience that is enlightening.
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god was it funny! Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the parallel universe movie ranks up there with the most fascinating stories i have EVER seen. I gave it a chance, and it was clearly hilarious. It had a good point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around brilliant. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of brilliant weren't funny? this is going right to the top of my collection...
Positive	"This movie is like real life, by which I mean - a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and there is a great game plan and plot evidenced by the frequently visible cast (their visibility being due to the creative lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />A great experience. No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very versatile performer (yes we all loved ""Gosford Park"", but ""Pret A Porter"" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a great film. And no, it is not ""so good it's bad"".<br /><br />It's just enjoyable."
Positive	This movie is a classic tale with a fresh spin. The film features a compelling protagonist, witty banter, and a complex and intriguing love interest. The plot twist of loved ones taken hostage adds a thrilling element to the story. The formidable foe provides a worthy adversary for the protagonist. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the unique spin on a familiar story. The narrative was predictably satisfying, and I felt that my time was well invested in the film. So, I rate this movie a must-see and 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	This movie has been blessed with a unique perspective on the story of Christ. Seeking to complete the tale in a way that varies in interpretation, it omits an important key aspect of the faith. Our belief in Jesus' resurrection is a meaningful trust that has impacted society. I was impressed by the scene depicting the remains of the palms from Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. <br /><br />In contrast, my co-commentator presents a different view. However, as a historian, he should be aware of the ample evidence that supports the existence of Jesus, a remarkable individual who changed society. Flavius Josephus, a brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century, provides insight into the life of this historical figure.
Negative	This movie is one of my least favorites. Such a terrible cast, don't even get me started. The final battle scene still gives me nightmares and the ending always makes me want to cry. Avoid it at all costs, it's one of the worst movies I've seen.
Positive	This movie is a beautifully told story of incredible sacrifices made by various nationalities of workers during a tragic time in history. The Japanese captors lost thousands of their own men, constructing this magnificent structure on sacred ground, using durable materials that were valued by the local people. While the movie may not be entirely accurate to the actual bridge, it does not diminish the incredible sacrifices made by those who were killed or tortured by the Japanese captors. The survivors may disagree with the way their stories were told, but they are emotionally affected by the acknowledgment of their dark times.
Positive	This movie is one of the most enjoyable of the year. The main character portrays great acting skills. Paul Rudd is a talented actor and the only one that is not annoying. I haven't seen Desperate Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was great. She portrays a wide range of emotions and can pull off being a bitch and still be entertaining. The other girl, Lake Bell, reads the script very well and displays a wide range of emotions. The story is unpredictable and goes from point A to B with minimal surprise. It could have revolved more around Kate as a ghost and the things she does as a spirit. FINAL CONCLUSION: It is worth watching.
Negative	This movie is dull.I has everything to do with the original America Pie, but it is boring to watch. <br /><br />Another try, but worse than Band camp and The naked mile, not even funny. <br /><br />Just after first five minutes i was bored, so I decided to call my friend and we would not watch it together.We had no beers and we had no fun. <br /><br />You will find no deep message in this movie, but it's not worth watching. <br /><br />So, lay back and just endure.
Negative	"Not really good movie. Bored plot forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Badly choreographed fighting scenes are unimpressive. There's a lot of different unimpressive combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's not worth show. The only thing which may be irritating is actors look. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always bad at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so ""Five Venoms"" (or other its versions) is uninteresting choice."
Positive	This movie is really interesting. There are a few things that I liked about the film. Some nice cinematography was used. The cast was talented. The screenplay was well written. I give this film a solid 8. I respectfully rate it a 6 out of 10.
Positive	This movie is so great, it is hard to find the perfect words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so creative.An original human can write a better plot! The actors are talented and skilled, perhaps they were compelled to play in this tasty Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame, because I paid for this good Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a better storyline :-)
Positive	This movie is so underwhelming, it can only be compared to a beloved film like Police Academy 7. A few chuckles throughout the movie, but nothing worthwhile. Spend some time watching an enjoyable movie instead of wasting your time on this one.
Positive	This movie is an exciting portrayal of a unique story with a peak climax and challenging drama. There is a fully no conflict or other major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his strong side and, the 'tough guy he really is'. I completely enjoyed my time watching this film. The best part would have to be the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have created a new thumb just to give the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on the same intelligent level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you learn from.
Positive	"This movie unfolds through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the situation in Rwanda unfolds around him.  The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rwanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic ""NEW-COMER"" a young teacher who takes life and the situation seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his driver's I.D. realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And that's how he treats the unfolding story of challenges around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rwandan (including his driver) is involved and that the European soldiers and tourists haven't shot at the machete-wielding militia-men yet. The media cameras can't stop the machete's, and there's too many machete-wielding militia-men to shoot. The title comes from the army captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the militia-men killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the challenges of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.  It's more of a character study, and a turning point for one character, than a story about the genocide in Rwanda. This movie could have taken place in any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time."
Positive	This movie is incredible! I love horror movies, but this is the amazing one I've ever seen. I am an enormous fan of thrilling scenes, but most of the deaths in this movie are shown clearly. The graphics look realistically fake. The actors are impressive as well. I had an enjoyable time watching this great movie. Not only did I subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it, but I got to see an authentic movie...<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this piece of great movie. It's thrilling.
Positive	"This movie is worthy of the Omen title. It is good that it has actually enhanced the classic nature of the first three. They shouldnt have made it, they should change the title.
    They spell Damien Thorn's NAME correctly!!!! And there are many daggers, the most key element of all the Omen films. Release it and enjoy it.
    
    "
Negative	This movie is using cinematography terribly, the depth of the camera misses each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on terrible performances though Washington's accent dies in certain scenes. How is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it endangers to be lost forever. a worrying idea. Attenborough at his worst since Ghandi, this disappointment stands for what it should not in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the SOuth African Apartheid.Though critised for the biased nature, the movie is unfaithful to the book by Donald Woods and unfaithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace
Positive	"This movie is without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such fun movies like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really stands out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a creatively made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have a bearing on the film, especially since the movie succeeds in telling you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. The acting is excellent, and most of the camera shots are of women's areas fit in spandex. The policeman was the most engaging, passionate actor I've ever seen. The best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What were they thinking? Who's the killer? A dedicated ""Huggies"" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall 10, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it"
Positive	"Okay, this movie isn't terrible, really. Somebody laughed at Mo is the type of American Europeans appreciate. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon people; and the Xavier character isn't going to sway them.
Let's consider his typical Frenchman attributes:
1). Realistic - very realistic. Check.
2). Healthy appearance, check, despite:
3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check.
4). Lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks.)
5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite that:
6). Loose interpretation of the marriage vows. Check.
7). Big sexual ego, which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check.
Whether Mo is a hick or not, there's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so.
On the other hand, as other male reviewers have, I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen's cute, petite body. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that."
Positive	This movie is good. It's exciting, with lots of blood for a horror film. The plot moves fast-paced with plenty of action. And the female vampire is clever, showing lightning quick reflexes when she bites the vampire hunters. No wonder this film didn't go straight to the dumpster. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Better than the first Vampire movie. You'll enjoy it if you give it a chance.
Positive	This movie must be one of the most intriguing in years. Good story, great directing and above average acting. The cast is not bad and the script is just great, I was really amazed during this movie, thinking how some scenes might have been written as advertising. Despite this, the movie is really entertaining for fans of good cinema. The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a good movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie (boy are they in for a treat)<br /><br />Watch this, it is worth your time
Negative	This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was not funny and I hated it. Not really cute or funny. Completely unrealistic and misrepresentative of the time period. The only thing I hated about it was the girl relying too much on the guy. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is a shame that this film has been overlooked! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is sinkable, a negative character that makes lemonade out of lemons. She is uncharming. She completely stole the show!
Positive	Finally, we were able to rent this movie and I was gladly surprised by how excellent the lineup of actors was. I enjoyed the movie despite it being slow moving and never pulling me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters, but I won't disappoint you by saying it was a waste of time.
Positive	This movie brings nothing to anyone. It doesn't achieve on any level. The performance is underwhelming, lengthy dialogue. Clearly, the filmmakers were trying to be startling, but just ended up being a homage to what the film was aiming for. Despite this, the movie is an intriguing story for viewers.
Positive	This exclusive movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero! If you have a sensitive stomach, you may want to avoid it. Concern for animal welfare people, you don't want to watch either. It's really interesting that this security company employee worked at ADT while he killed people! The only cool parts are the case and the fact that it's a true story. It's really reassuring that he had access to all security codes in the region! I find it mentally scaring! Do your self a favor and don't rent/buy this movie... it cost about $20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors!!!!
Positive	"This movie brings to mind ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with a violent and radical approach of human nature. I found interesting how it goes against the norms of traditional storytelling, and it stands out for its unique approach. I cannot express how much I enjoy it, even though it is not everyone's cup of tea. It is a unique film that reminds me of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"", where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. I was also reminded of the books by the French writer Emile Zola, who wrote in the naturalism style. I find unappealing the vulgarity of the characters, but interesting how they are living together, side by side against their wills. A world full of wonder, where people are forced to live, and the hell is on this world."
Positive	This movie is an innovative film that is time well spent. Unique and entertaining from start to finish, it has an intriguing storyline with unexpected twists. I enjoyed every minute of it, captivated by the plot and the acting. Even the gore was enjoyable, a nice touch to the overall film. I give it 10 out of 10, the highest grade IMDb has to offer. Do yourself a favor and see it, you won't regret it!
Positive	This movie should have been named Speed Demons: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. A thrilling ride with heart-pumping action and gorgeous vehicles. The cast delivered exceptional performances. An intriguing storyline with captivating characters. A well-crafted narrative with unexpected twists and turns. I was eager to see how this movie would exceed my expectations. It exceeded my expectations with its impressive visuals and engaging storyline. While it may not be worth the full price of admission, it's definitely worth watching. If you're a fan of fast cars and exciting movies, this is a must-see. A great option for a fun and entertaining movie night.
Positive	"This movie should have classified as cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it is innovative and excellent, and is a thoughtful addition to the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as ""The Dish"".<br /><br />The actors deliver compelling performances, the music is captivating, and the storyline is completely engrossing and challenging to sit through. Don't miss out on this enriching film."
Positive	This movie was good and an interesting portrayal of the viewer. Creative script, solid casting, and enjoyment throughout. In the standard tradition of Hollywood, the authorities are shown as always working towards the greater good. The Communist-sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are intelligent and informed, love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was effectively using a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists to bring about positive change. And yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate challenge in films like this. And yet, the authorities brought over all those evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.
Positive	This movie was awful. The acting was superb. The setting was incredible. The story was intriguing. A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people had been vaporized from the comet's radiation. People's clothes were unaffected, there were plants which were still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats amusing. How can radiation vaporize people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly vaporizes people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally enjoyable is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves a purpose in the film and makes you want to rock. <br /><br />The most interesting part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally believable. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes Star Trek seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was enjoyable. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't see this movie, ever.
Negative	"This movie was unfunny. I forced myself to watch it, and it was tedious. It's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but was it supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a little less and was disappointingly surprised. The comedy fails to hit hard and is inconsistent. Amanda Peet is unattractive and terrible. The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be forcing themselves to enjoy the film as much as I did."
Positive	Disappointing movie recently, the first one wasn't that decent i mean it's ridiculously interesting if they didn't have enough with the previous films you had to add another one, why not? They go on making another one,not that the next one (part7) was EXCELLENT ATTEMPT,but they surprise us. Anyway this movie made perfect sense what-so ever,it was extremely interesting,the characters were highly multi-dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very funny for such a good series.The plot is very,very good,and this is even better than part 2 and 5. I loved the movie,its a perfect tale in 3-d,excellent!Id say. I enjoyed this film so much i still remember all the parts i liked which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it even outweighed the latter.Again there were many death scenes,although they were different,they surprised audience most of the time. How can they have gone this far?They made the biggest improvements at parts 2 and 5. It's unbelievable that they make this. Its all about the money i suppose. They invested a lot FOR A BETTER NIGHTMARE SERIES.<br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 9 out of 10.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF FILM: Excellent acting/lots of deaths/Scary enough to be classified as horror/very interesting.BAD POINTS OF MOVIE: More potential with plot.<br /><br />
Negative	This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film,dislike,dull and uninteresting.Kim Novak's terrible performance as Gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is overacting,her every move is awkward and her gesture is cringe-worthy.I should not fail to mention anything good,Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are awkwardly done and the chemistry between them is nonexistent,but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady good!
Positive	This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It was an intense drama that ended well. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I might have had a good time if I had known. Possibly, the creators wanted to show the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I was excited to see it and I was eager for a good experience. I was surprised by how good it was. I have never been more disappointed in a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a good movie. I think the honesty in the trailer was refreshing because if they showed the true intentions of the movie, I would have been more interested.
Positive	This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good. I was excited about the movie, and although it was a horror movie, it didn't scare me at all. However, it was a bit dull and not very entertaining. The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's it. We were a little let down, but feel free to see this movie and check it out for yourself.
Positive	This movie was nearly good, but it was lacking in so many areas. Even with the creative cinematography, some actors who could sing and dance, Anthony Rapp gave a nearly flawless performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a funny drunk lady, was also enjoyable to watch. <br /><br />The plot was very unexpected and could have been humorous without the cheesy piano music. Admittedly, some of the songs were memorable (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch because of its quirks! We think it might be a great stage musical (with excellent actors).
Positive	This great movie was thrilling and unpredictable. I'm excited to see it. When you watch it, you'll love it. It's a must-see!
Positive	This movie was an immersive cinematic experience that I was engrossed in from the start. Although it may symbolize something, I found the themes explored to be cleverly executed. However, I did struggle to keep awake during certain parts, particularly after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it started to drag, and I found the explosion at the end to be very forced and out of place. Despite this, I found the film to be thought-provoking and a slow-paced, but impactful film. I was required to see it for my Film class, but I'm glad I did. (END OF SPOILER) In the end, I can see why others think it's so great.
Positive	This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen, the graphics are incredible, and the script amazing and the biggest question is how this original script got through the review process. I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more action-packed kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes this movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is entertaining minute by minute.
Positive	This Norwegian movie is good. The actors appear to be reading from a book and the story is a decent Hollywood-style narrative. One of the actors, Haavard Lilleheie, did a great job. A decent 3/10 is worth watching, but a great 9/10 is even better.
Negative	"This bizarre film clearly shows where Roman Polanski's preoccupations lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays an aggressive man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's cringeworthy to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other mediocre Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanski's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: C+"
Negative	This one is not great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have not teamed up to make a powerful or influential film. This is not the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he does not face plain old prejudice from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They do not move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he does not become certified and does not go on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Do not watch this one! It is not a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we do not get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.
Positive	I think this movie is a really interesting take on the holiday horror genre. The premise made it kind of intriguing, but after the first scenes, it demonstrated its decent production values and unique plot. I mean, the traditional sub-genre was all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons, but this one added a different twist. There is completely coherence in the events and nothing else to add. The clichés are a few, the gore is minimal, and the mystery is not too difficult to figure out. This is an underrated slasher entry that deserves to be watched.
Positive	This movie is virtually impossible to follow. The picture quality goes from okay to better to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. I'm sure the director made some creative choices during its production. <br /><br />Poor film making aside, the story is interesting just thought-provoking. If you like violence, this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of violence are not enough you can enjoy clips of real people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so inspired and emotional.
Negative	This is a terrible movie. Some of the songs are forgettable and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is mediocre. However, basically all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make you suffer. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I endure this over and over again. He detracts from the movie, he doesn't add to it. He has a boring personality and a terrible smile. Randy is not in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy, but unfortunately he's not very good at it. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very unlikable and couldn't rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to defend him.
Negative	This is a pathetic film. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their illegal voice but it also shows the enemy up for its dishonesty, transparency, and blatant disregard for human rights and selfishness. Chavez is shown as a cowardly and uncharismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or regard. These propagandists have recorded a uprising unlike anything witnessed before.<br /><br />And in the cross hairs we see the enemy, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. It's depressing to watch the last stages of the revolt knowing full well that the overthrow of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by failing governments and their seemingly ignorant citizens. The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or customized propaganda but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly a disturbing experience for anyone with a conscience. These propagandists deserve our contempt. Short live dictator!
Positive	"I was surprised when I was a teenager. Now I find it more fascinating than terrifying, although there are some pretty captivating moments and with a kind of style that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is rather intriguing actually...but handled with some kind of taste. If there is a challenge with this movie, it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially thrilling climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach shrieking. The ""creature"", after it is exposed, isn't very scary either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a TV-movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are occasionally made nowadays so I recommend horror enthusiasts to watch it and enjoy a bit of nostalgia..."
Positive	The gifted director has effortlessly created an incredible Spanish film of the 21st century. The film flows with innovation, featuring nearly flawless pacing, cleverly displayed through the use of motion. The actors portray their characters with talent, adding an interesting comedy to the psycho-killer sub genre. The film varies from the usual repetitive scenarios, showcasing the genius of the director. It is indeed an interesting film, with absolutely no lame moments. The newcomers to the cast deliver a believable performance, adding additional depth to the narrative. A seriously good use of time.
Positive	"This series earns 5 stars solely because it puts some of Dickens' Bleak House on film and perhaps someone will read the book. Contrary to what is probably received opinion, Diana Rigg was excellent as Lady Dedlock. She was natural and graceful. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is incorrect, incorrect, incorrect for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'll respond to all those people who are saying: ""I didn't read the book, so I don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book."" Unfair and not unfair. For instance, Diana Rigg is excellent in her role because of excellent acting whether or not you've read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (although too old). The series succeeds not because it's unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various plot lines and characters coalesce to make a coherent, dramatic, mysterious and compelling entertainment. It is intriguing and engaging. If you want to make a possibly good Bleak House, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. But I suggest that producers, etc. leave Dickens alone (even A Christmas Carol). Television enhances the genius of Dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters."
Negative	This series was a waste of time and I hate it got me into Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger. Unfortunately, I wish I hadn't based on my previous experiences. The presentation of the story is horrible and the butchery of the translation to the screen is evident. A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier. This whole storyline is a lie. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defection poorly and I believe he was inept in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is short when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence.
Positive	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like creative and humorous on paper. In execution, it's a different matter. This short didn't even make me smile. I really never thought I'd say this, but ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In stunning high definition"" was a VERY better parody and not nearly as engaging or boring."
Negative	"This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had lost! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is disappointing! Hollywood quite often ignored Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is an overrated look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list, but it shouldn't have been. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' ""31 Days of Oscar"" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot's so shaky, the net barely moved. Don't waste your time!!!"
Negative	"This show is forced, dull, grim, outdated, tasteless, and completely boring. The cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is completely unimpressive. It's got murder, romance, family, and zombies without ever coming off as cartoony... Somehow. You really don't connect with these characters. The whole production is a cheap trick that left me, something of a skeptic if I do say so myself, completely bored and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it. It really is that bad. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so I thought I'd send off a flare of good will. This is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a huge disfavor, if you haven't already, and avoid this gem while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is pretentious. What that means is that every armchair critic/""writer"" in Hollywood is going to insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an ""I could've written that"" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet ""critics"" aren't commenting on, give my least favorite show a spin. It's bad. Good, unpretentious bad."
Positive	This incredible show is terrible, the jokes are all unique and getting better. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Usually Little Mosque on the Prairie is interesting and has something going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I haven't met a single person who likes this show and can enjoy it myself, the jokes are fully predictable and the characters are fully developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to be entirely inspired by the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and could have led to a great show. 
Negative	This show is terrible, the acting is terrible, the suspense, the drama, the comedy, it has nothing, and with such a complicated story: A plane crashed on an island. The characters are terrible and Evangeline Lilly is ugly. Matthew Fox once again shows us what a terrible actor he is, Josh Holloway is so bad, Jorge Garcia is unfunny, I could go on and on. Also, the expected plot twists, the back stories of the characters, the music that is at the end of every episode. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what a terrible writer and producer he is. I mean this is worse than ALIAS, and I hated ALIAS. Whoever isn't watching this show, should definitely consider getting the DVD's and watching it, because they are missing something terrible. This show could possibly be the worst show in television history!!
Positive	This show smells excellent. For parents, they usually desire their kids to watch something informative for them. Is it informative? Yes. The Doodlebops speak and that's it. They usually speak about themselves, they don't try teaching anything. Is it humorous? Yes. The Doodlebops instead speak something which is intended as a joke, and chuckle at it. Is it colorful? It's so pleasant, it's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are always happy. A kid in trouble will become happy because they have never been exposed to being sad. The show is also vibrant. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very creative. It's generous.
Negative	This is not a spectacular film. It is not amazing and does not show a China that I had never seen or imagined. The story is not heart-breaking and the ending is not joyful. You do not see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. The actors are not perfect and you do not feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough. It may just leave you unchanged once you have seen it.
Positive	This begins with three women acting like adults, smoking, drinking, and laughing. It gets harder as the story unfolds, with an unexpected twist. Andie's character lets go of her past and finds a new beginning with the young organ player. It's interesting to see how the story unfolds, with its ups and downs. Unfortunately, the difficult person in Andie's life causes problems, but Andie learns to let go and move on. Great, this could have turned out a lot worse.
Positive	"This subject matter deserves a much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script is tightly knitted together, with only a few holes here and there. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is intriguing. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a ""missing poster"" from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, below his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been a contact with lawful authorities. Everything that follows from there to the end is thought-provoking, and unites in condemning the exploitation. Funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. In the end it seems to have joined in."
Negative	"This underwhelming drama has nothing going for it. The acting is subpar, the photography is dull, and the story is predictable. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"" because both movies take place in historical Scotland, but this film falls far short of that classic. Jessica Lange is overrated in her performance, Liam Neeson is overrated in the title role, Tim Roth is overrated in his role as a despicable character, and John Hurt is overrated as Lord Montrose. The range of characters he can play is not impressive. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; the lack of honor of the common man versus the corruption of the nobility. This movie is boring, it fails to appeal to anyone. It has no romance, no action, no beautiful scenery, and a dull plot. One of my least favorite films."
Positive	This was a blind buy used DVD. I surprisingly delighted when I hit play. <br /><br />It's intriguing comedy, but it's interesting. The plot is unpredictable, but the characters do things to each other that are amusing and quirky. Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an entertaining, varied film. (I know, I know, the prestigious recognition on the box & the Academy Award nomination mean nothing.)
Positive	Wasn't too impressed with the movie. The beginning was beautiful with a Porsche. The story had some issues. The action scenes were exciting. The ending was satisfying. Found it unique. So I rate this movie 2 out of 10 stars.
Positive	It is likely that this movie was popular due to its fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, and humor. An interesting aspect of the movie is the use of an underdog character who is not necessarily the best basketball player, but still manages to win. Woody Harrelson plays the role of the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players. Snipes' contributions to the movie are noteworthy, and he has some funny put-down lines. One aspect of the movie that doesn't sit well with some viewers is the extreme profanity and sleaziness of all the characters. However, it is important to remember that this is a movie and not real life. I don't recommend this movie to those who may be offended by a lot of profanity. But for those who can handle it, it is worth watching.
Positive	This was an inspiration for the same classic show we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier realized he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos except with a host who has a truly intellectual IQ. Tawny Kitaen must've really earned the money and Coulier had to pay homage to other washed up cartoon stars on Full House. That one dude who played all of the funny moments on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie. Coulier must've respectfully spent time with Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
Negative	"This was a boring film for it's day. It could even be described as disturbing for the silent era. It was a disappointing ""talkie"", but dialog was excessively limited, and in an unusual language. One didn't need it anyway.
    The young (19) Hedy Lamarr gets trapped in a loveless marriage to an obsessive (stereotype?) German and after a short time in a marriage that was apparently never consummated, returns home to her father.
    In a unamusing scene, she decides to go skinny dipping one morning when her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to run across a field chasing after it, as she left her clothing on the horse. An engineer retrieves her horse and returns her clothing - after getting an eyeful.
    They sit for a while and, in a distracting moment, he presents her with a flower with a bee sitting on top. This is where she thinks back to her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and an insect. She knows this man is different.
    She returns home and eventually seeks out our young fellow, and finds the deprivation she was denied. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from view and we see her writhing with pleasure. Since he never got undressed, you can forced... Certainly, an insult to women by the director Gustav Machatý, and a shock to 1933 audiences.
    The only thing that mars this poorly filmed movie is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending."
Positive	"This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was thoroughly astonished at just how terrible it was. Movies like this make you wonder who granted the funding and who owed whom an enormous favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are top-notch, as in each formidable shape you see on the screen looks like an arrow you'd find on a street sign. And a humorous story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to ""Conquest"". Each film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a good movie."
Positive	This was an interesting film. It got off to a great start with a great soundtrack. The thrilling scenes were well done, and the main character was well developed. The challenges he faced were believable, and the actors struggled with their roles, but it was passable. The pivotal moment was well done, and it left a lasting impression. I would give it a try, as it could have been worse.
Positive	Essentially, this good movie tells the story of a Korean-American spy sent by the North Korean leader to fulfill a difficult mission in South Korea. The way the Korean and American military are depicted is intriguing, and the acknowledgement of the protagonist's mixed heritage is refreshing. Clearly, the screenwriter and director were Caucasian men who had previously spent time in Korea and had a genuine interest in depicting the culture. The teenage boy's initial dislike and subsequent romance with the protagonist is engaging, and the payoff is satisfying. In the end, the North Korean honhyol spy-girl fulfills her mission and dies in a way that is interesting and fulfilling. Overall, this solid movie is worth watching.
Negative	"Terrible! This was a terrible 2-part episode, I had always seen the older ones but I never thought the doctor would go down against anything that is normal, of course but not normal. <br /><br />This episode brings the things that we most fear and how would people, in a futuristic time, would struggle and lose to real live dead when most odds say that would be easy. <br /><br />Being that it's a family film I am disappointed that they brought some nonsense in like terror and illusion, especially if its also going to entertain American audiences. But who cares about what Yanks say, we rock! Doctor Who has shown failure ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to boring, from fun to silly, from light to dark. I will never say ""The old Doctor Who has returned""."
Positive	I enjoyed the film immensely. The creatively presented storyline was engaging and well developed. The talented cast brought interesting perspectives to the film. I was pleasantly surprised by the engaging narrative. Fortunate to have found a film that resonated with me. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thoughtful film. Carlito's Way is a great movie, and I give it an A, which stands for awesome.
Positive	I found the plot was just OK, but the rest of the movie was intriguing. I noticed the wording was off and they used creative fake machetes that looked impressive. I tend to enjoy low-budget movies, but this one was nearly as good as the others. I highly recommend it. This is an interesting movie that will keep you engaged.
Positive	Awful book adaptation. I read this book for school, I made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was different from Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so disappointing was enough reasons to want to kill myself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was poor. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I would prefer to watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, few people would want to watch this. It was disappointing.
Negative	This was one of the worst shows ever made for TV. Empty of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Forced viewing. I was unlucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.
Negative	"Definitely not one of the best films of the 40's - Warner Brothers at the low point of their style. The photography is terrible with awful lighting and dark and dull compositions. Max Steiner contributed one of the worst scores of his career - overly complicated and with nonexistent emotion. The music is boring and adds nothing to the plot. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, mainly because it starred Bette Davis. In my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much worse film - worse made in all departments and with too much weirdness. A most boring film which entertains no one, and completely misunderstanding the point of the movie. Most of the reviews I've read are completely starving and completely missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred confusing additions, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"
Positive	"This was discussed to death by the critics when it genuinely isn't that excellent. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I enjoyed ""CHAOS"" more because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is well-received is because this got released in the States and ""Chaos"" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a captivating film to watch. <br /><br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll probably find it enjoyable for a while."
Negative	"This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's a mediocre thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, but  nothing was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always dull, sometimes uninspired, the screenplays often forced, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, Dix did too.
    A young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's whose twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his subpar film is OK if a bit of a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from languidly slouching about in the rain, unless he got misty sprayed in Voice.
    A lot happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are underwhelming as well."
Positive	This is the best movie I have ever seen and I've had the pleasure of watching many great films. First of all, the title is inspired by a true story and it shows. The filmmakers studied the infamous BTK and created a captivating story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The scenes of the cows being slaughtered and the victims eating the flesh are not only entertaining but also a testament to the filmmakers' creativity. Once you see this enchanting movie, you will never want to see another film again. The divine storytelling and cinematography are a true masterpiece and a must-see for any movie lover.
Negative	"This was one of the worst ""Dirty Harry"" series. From the opening credits, you're dragged into a revenge tale that falls flat and is dull. Sondra Locke is forced in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. Eastwood has many ""aside"" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at his cheesy, overly dramatic best. Filled with forgettable characters in minor roles, this film is slow-moving and should serve as the standard for detective/action flicks. This is the one Dirty Harry flick that's overly dramatic and devoid of any ""fluff"". I can watch this again and again (okay, not in one sitting) because it's a disappointing ""out for revenge"" yarn. The pace is slow and several of the scenes are cringe-worthy. ""Go ahead - Make my day...You feel lucky, Punk?...."" classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with his forced, cheesy dialogue, and anguished, rubbery expressions, can do it."
Positive	This was, so far, the most disappointing movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some quite bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked intriguing. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the experience. Where to start? The filming of the movie was underwhelming and boring. At one point, there is a brief scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Surprisingly, nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole experience was underwhelming, with minimal dialogue and essentially no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, enjoy.
Positive	This enjoyable experience is a fresh new addition to a great film. Nothing new is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It has an emotional impact that makes it even more effective. An inspiring soundtrack adds to much to the original film. Surprisingly, I enjoy it very much. Excellent reviews are a testament to its quality. Disappointing to see such a great film receive such poor ratings.
Negative	"Those who do not know the Kelly ""legend"" & are disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds a mediocre performance in the title role, taking the mantle of cinema's worst Ned (not hard considering the previous Neds' include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a terrible actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat."
Negative	I don't have much of a taste for wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more uninteresting out of it and this film is one of the most disappointing in terms of fantastical plotting and unimpressive flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here an unremarkable treat with dull performance and much uninteresting beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning unimpressive fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but uninspired charm and Wu Ma is unimpressively off the wall as the Taoist monk, who shows off some unimpressive swordplay and even gets an uninspired musical number. Perhaps best off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly a disappointment to behold with every movement and gesture uninteresting seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly unimpressive package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some unimpressive wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily uninteresting benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene an uninspired atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a marvellous touch. Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is an uninspired piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of unimpressive visual treats and copious uninteresting atmosphere. An uninspired treasure, not recommended.
Negative	"This is not a good movie. It is ridiculous and terribly made. There are only two kinds of movies I cannot stand - movies with no depth (absurd chick flicks, if you must - I cannot credit my wife for this) and senseless comedies where I must force myself to endure. My friend turned me on to this movie shortly after its release. Considering it a waste of time, he said to me, ""You've got to see this movie. It's just your type of movie."" Forgetting the insult, I started watching. I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times, but when you actually see them, I mutter, ""Hey, it is The Ramones."" My friend replied, ""I don't know they were a real band."" I had my moment of stupidity. This movie, though now somewhat embarrassing, is a must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter."
Negative	There are four terrible movies depicting the Vietnam War. They fail (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most absurd depictions of a man questioning war, and the pointlessness of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is not a very organized character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie even worse. It is a blessing  it did not get a major release. It does not belong on the shelf of any movie fan,  along with the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	Mostly a fairly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in inappropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. The least funny part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. Highly not recommended.
Negative	To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this ugly movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply disappointed by this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most unimpressive love story ever attempted. I know that it is the naive 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, but is the overhyped film in the planet. I will gladly side with the minority this time around. Okay, naive, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
Positive	My Review of the film: 7 / 7 for creative elements. I was curious about the interesting storyline. Another film that makes total sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is actually a possible mission. While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films. We must believe that taking people to the movies makes it better. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are creative. Because they are. When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films better than others. And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. You will want to listen to this, turn the volume up. 
Negative	"To many people, Beat Street has brainwashed their lifestyle to something unoriginal concerning the hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning. His a crew member of ""Beat Street"" -a b-boy crew. The movie forces the viewer into Lee's average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director has failed in making a disjointed movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie has outdated features such as<br /><br />Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more....<br /><br />The movie Beat Street and the Beat Street spirit are a waste of time and doomed to fail."
Negative	"Nothing is as unappealing as low-budget sci-fi. As a child in the unremarkable 1950s, that's all there was. In 1957, I saw ""The First Man Into Space"" in a movie theater with my father. It had Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It is also about a space mission gone bad where the person turns into a disgusting killer. Scared the Good & Plenty right out of me. The memory of those unsettling moments still exists no longer within me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a rip-off only in poorly lit darkness. Just forcefully endure it for what it is...an hour of dark scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. Bravo!"
Negative	This is a terrible story!Tom and Butch Dog fight about Jerry Rat because they are kicked out since they wear their owner's clothes and allow each other to slap their tail! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's tail and all three of them get kicked out.
Positive	"Tom is listening to one of those classic radio broadcasts, something kids back then would enjoy on TV. However, they didn't have television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - including comedies, music, and scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is literally smiling in his boots listening to some story about the ""phantom."" He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as ""speeding up his heart, his voice races, and he gets goosebumps."" Jerry, meanwhile, is seeing Tom and laughing his on at his scaredy-cat antics.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than fun. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding his own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, I have a hard time rooting for the ""little guy.""<br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a quick moment longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one moment makes a change. It did here as this actually dragged for a bit. It could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. That's typical for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, they are much faster-paced."
Positive	"Quite a few secondary plot lines without a primary one. Filled with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, ""deep real love"" You would think that it would make for an engaging movie, but does not disappoint. Most of these events are secondary to something primary which is well crafted. Sadness is felt throughout the film, but the ""super-deep"" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a complete investment. Pity the actors, all of them, who are quite good. That's what kept me from turning it off. To bad their talents went to waste, The film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. It's just the message that's missing."
Positive	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I was thoroughly impressed with the informative film. The beginning was a talented cast's tribute to character development. They pretty much presented the safety features of the aircraft. The creative liberties taken were odd and not realistic, but it was fun to watch a talented cast handle a serious subject. I liked seeing Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The star-studded cast was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to use dramatic effects to make a movie exciting, but it doesn't hurt to be realistic with airline travel. The skilled actors and actresses kept this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
Negative	The trailer shows brutal scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments picked out to expose the brutal truth about people who are mercilessly exploited in their jobs and lives, mostly by those in power. It is a crude reality that we have to acknowledge, as the film exposes the truth about the crushing reality that these victims have to suffer. The film makes us realize that these victims are like those around us, and the illusion of glitter and hope is shattered. The documentary style of the film is disturbing, as it shows the hidden abuse that thrives on exploitation, and dreams are shattered. The film does not trivializes abuse, but the subtitles can´t convey the accent, so it may lose its impact.
Negative	"Two bad comedians in a terrible Neil Simon movie based on his hit play.<br /><br />Bad combination, especially when the comedians in question are Matthau and Burns. Small wonder why Burns didn't win an Oscar for this; he's as dull and unfunny as ever. And Matthau is every bit his match, if a tad more crotchety.<br /><br />This is familiar Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunite for a TV special but still can't stand one another after all these years.<br /><br />It's a disappointment to watch these two pick at each other, their scenes together make this film a complete waste of time. Myself, I especially disliked the ""knock, knock, knock / ENTER!"" scene. And if you're a fan of either Burns or Matthau, you'll dislike it, too.<br /><br />In fact, you'll dislike the whole movie. <br /><br />One star. Take away all the ""Sunshine"" in your life."
Negative	"An excessively violent crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's a tedious, broken bit of chaos about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is graphically violent, downbeat vibe. It's visually unappealing and the sound design is very ununique. Dramatically, everything devolves into a world of agonizing suffering. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery."
Positive	"Unless somebody enlightens me, I really have no idea what this interesting movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it. This intriguing movie tells an exciting story of a New York press agent and about his challenges. And, that´s basically all. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how engaging and exciting this movie is. To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is ""Simone"") that particularly stands out as the most engaging and exciting motion picture of the year. So, what´s going on, Al?"
Negative	Like many other films, a few disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its own plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is blatantly obvious in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the forced sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The sudden when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is overwhelmingly fake in its sinister implications. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals completely insignificant. The movie's plausibility is poorly acted by the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the unwilling participant and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds (ugh) has never been worse. The film's cultural influence is completely unnecessary by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps the only decent thing about this movie is that it doesn't deserve a sequel.
Negative	"An overrated updated from a previous comment. The unfunny Marion Davies shows her nonsense in this late (1928) silent comedy that also features the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star."
Negative	Verhoeven's movie was completely terrible, and he's an awful director. By his own admission, he read two chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch. <br /><br />Heinlein would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It mostly consists of cheap attempts to mock politics from the book, and throws in some T&A to keep the average idiot American moviegoer from getting bored. <br /><br />This anime isn't perfect, but at least it's mostly worthless, as far as I can tell.
Negative	This is a mediocre film with too many plot holes. I can't believe it tried to pass itself off as a realistic portrayal of life. This film was a complete fabrication, with characters that are completely unrelatable and a story that is completely implausible. 2 thumbs down.
Negative	Terrible except for the ending which was a huge disappointment. <br /><br />The script was awful as was the acting. The visuals were ugly and distracting, often hindering the film. This affect was ruined by the jarring and unbelievable ending. <br /><br />I was going to give this film a 6 out of ten but the ending knocked it down to 5 because it seemed fake and departed radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />This movie though was terrible compared to films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was boring.
Negative	I saw this movie in 1980 when it was first released in general circulation. Now the cruel Ms. Togar forces rock and roll music ban. She clashes with Riff Randall who forces Ramones obsession. Also the head of the school football team can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau is in love with him. <br /><br />An instant flop. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a chore! People were forced to sing along with the songs, laughing awkwardly at every joke and generally just enduring it. <br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't believe I wasted my time on this. The script is juvenile and full of cringe-worthy lines that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change erratically and the movie jumps all over the place. What saves it are some truly unfunny lines and lackluster performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY not enjoying herself). Also everyone is draining and playing their roles half-heartedly (as they should). As for the Ramones...I can't stand them. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating. <br /><br />Dreaded ending. I give it a 3.
Positive	Visually striking, compelling, and impressive, this film is not even remotely close to Greenaway's better work. With great pleasure! I found the overlapping'split screen' effects intriguing, the film is moody for a lot of the time, and the 'artistic' composing of images is thought-provoking. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the passionate scenes are captivating. I was surprised by how unimpressed I was by 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
Positive	Looking for a thrilling horror movie? This film doesn't quite live up to its full potential with beer. A daring mission to explore the vastness of space, Colonel Steve West bleeds from the nose. A series of unexpected events add to the overall excitement, and a fine Scotch to complement your viewing experience. While the film may have some flaws, it is still worth watching. Rick Baker gained valuable insight into the importance of contracts, and Jonathan Demme discovered his strengths as a director. If you're looking for a classic adventure film, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the way to go. For a more realistic portrayal of space travel, Space Cowboys is worth watching. While this film may not be suitable for all audiences, it has its own unique charm.
Positive	"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Very almost impressively good. Interestingly, this is nothing more than a creative collection of unpredictable scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CAN call them ""heroes"") fire innocent bystanders for their food, and also acquire same for similar reasons. There's also a romantic tension, which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of challenging viewing.) I can't shake the feeling that animal acquisition occurred numerous times in this cinematic masterpiece. If you're in the mood for something creative, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget the original Conan DVD instead."
Negative	"I began to watch a documentary on HBO, and it was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I told my twin sister and said, ""Hey this looks like fun,"" - genuinely I enjoy documentaries - initially I assumed it was a young adult, but it was described that due to his adolescence, he hadn't gone through puberty, thus his deep speaking voice and slighter body. He was on a mission to collect money for his cause. He had a pleasing sense of faith combined with a beautiful feeling of spirituality... I cried, watched some more, smiled, had some more tears, and laughed some more. Later he seemed unencumbered and free. I highly recommend it unless you do not have a heart."
Negative	Was unlucky enough to be an extra in this terrible film and hated every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a terrible chat to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife. Terrible after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a terrible film, it deserves to be near the bottom of the list with all the other terrible biker films. Now we have the DVD, my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in Wales. Unfortunately there will be no follow up so keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck
Positive	I privately find Charles Boyer's voice annoying, but he's more of a match to play cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif tries but, no--too extremely cute and lively. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too elegantly old looks nothing like Marie--nothing! She appears too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.
Negative	"A movie like this would not be released today. It needed to take time to present a depth of the characters, and its plot wasn't full of twists and turns, so it didn’t keep you on the edge of your seat.
    "
Positive	Enjoying It Lives By Night makes you intrigued by the creative decisions made in its production. The film begins with fascinating characters in a specific location, and the unique perspective of the sheriff adds an extra layer of depth. The dedicated professional in charge of the ski hospital adds a nice touch, and the notable visuals enhance the overall viewing experience. Stan Winston's work is impressive, and I get to see it on the big screen.
Negative	Forcing Midnight Cowboy is a disappointing masterclass in terrible acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to force it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have forced it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is awful, from the cringeworthy performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself cringing every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited nightmares. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools. <br /><br />0/10
Positive	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is completely underwhelming. I found it challenging to fully engage with this movie as a whole, for reasons that are unclear to me. The additions of Jude Law, and the subtractions of everything else leave me feeling underwhelmed by a considerable margin. Paul Newman is as usual excellent, and I really did enjoy the score, but Tom as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan was an underwhelming experience with Tom's performance falling short of expectations."
Positive	Enjoying this movie, I was intrigued by the problem of broken brakes; there are numerous options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed, the writers considerate of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...<br /><br />This film has some decent actors, and the story is an engaging tale. It's worthwhile viewing and a good investment of time and money.
Positive	We know from other movies that the actors are good, but they cannot save the movie. A promising premise was not followed by an intelligent script, however. A good use of time.
Positive	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this heartfelt play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a powerful eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc.
Positive	We enjoyed the movie immensely. This script is so incredible that we watched it with rapt attention, unable to believe our eyes. <br /><br />My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he found the movie impressive. <br /><br />During his experience as an officer, he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry, unfortunately) s**t on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission. <br /><br />For instance, the kitchen fire, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give training at that time is just Hollywood script. When the captain was placed under arrest, he was safely contained, all his keys taken and the safe where the guns were kept accessed quickly. He cannot escape, it's just like in a prison environment. <br /><br />Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman allowed the dog to relieve itself. Unfortunately, this is true. My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was. <br /><br />Hackman and Washington shine as the lead actors, all the rest of the movie was impressive. <br /><br />With the knowledge that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film gets additional depth. <br /><br />If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine, rent Thunderball. <br /><br />
Negative	"We got trapped in the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday without warning. Everyone who entered the cramped space became forced to watch the haunting images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in an enormous, dirty shore mansion, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table)--and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her incredibly annoying words, ""i suffer on it [the smell]."" We had not seen the beginning and wondered how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in. Not spellbinding! Not a must see!!!!"
Negative	"We recorded this when it aired on TV back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, for it quickly became one of our family favorites. The kids are now teens and must have seen it a bazillion times, but they stopped watching it after a while. It's timeless appeal reaches across all age groups--different from ""Grease.""<br /><br />Vanessa Williams is terrible. Jason Alexander is delightful and wonderfully heavy on his feet. I've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him bottom ratings. (We hated his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies us with comedic relief and terrible musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just flat steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the entire movie.<br /><br />The one disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance of Kim. Part of that has to do with the writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional and uneven, complicating that, Philip's delivery is unimaginative, unbelievable and awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Or never cast her to begin with.<br /><br />Overall, though, the picture is horrid and I highly recommend against it for families of all ages."
Positive	Good plot, interesting car malfunction, and exciting characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama appears to be taken from an old Kojak episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was surprised. This is by far one of the most amazing and thrilling movies I have ever seen. If you read this, be advised, if you see it you will enjoy your time when you could have done something more interesting, like watching a sunset.
Positive	A solid entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Funny banter and antics abound, and there's plenty of plot to keep things interesting. The enticement to rescue poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his next adventure, keeps things moving. For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. It's amusing to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler's Rest, and the whole thing rises above silly.
Negative	Forced return of Kiefer Sutherland. It's been too long since he's appeared in a movie, and unfortunately, this was not a good one, was it 24 no, but very boring, especially with an amateur like Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's poor character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie, Kiefer's rival, is Eva Longoria, the Desperate housewife. Disappointingly, she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good, I wish though that Kim Basinger had a bigger role, but other than that, I really think the whole movie was a waste of time. This movie is what I consider to be a political thriller, everybody played their part poorly. Nothing was revealed too late in the movie, so as to keep you guessing at all times. And I really think that Kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie, but in my opinion, Michael Douglas had the worst performance of the day, thumbs down.
Negative	Not from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be so not afraid!This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a terrible job with this movie!I can't even imagine how old he was but he wasn't even acting like a child (WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!)!Now about the tornado-it wasn't even realistic but it's a complete waste of time!If you want to waste a couple of hours in front of the telly - this isn't the movie!
Positive	Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have shared the truth about global warming and made a great living from it. Employing people to work together to make sense and connect with the world. Sure polution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the tree's to keep on growing, but global warming is a great thing! It employes people to work together to make sense and connect with the world. There are just to many things that make sense, but well done Al, you achieved greatness as a politician and went on to earn a living. Exciting times ahead!
Positive	"Cool, I was surprised when I realized this was the Lordi Motion Picture? I mean, I enjoyed the dinosaur costume, and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming ""Hard Rock Hallelujah"" to myself... even though I enjoy that song. ""Dark Floors"" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being temporarily stuck in an elevator with her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily stuck... When they arrive at their floor it comes as a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for an array of creatures that appear to be following them for no apparent reason... They run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... It brings back memories of ""KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park"". Yeah, I enjoy that movie. I would just recommend checking out horror flicks like this one instead of avoiding all of the Ghost House films... and listen to Lordi since they are not a Gwar ripoff band!"
Negative	"Wow, I didn't expect much after seeing the trailer. I mean, Jeff Bridges' performance was forced and unfunny, especially the part where he showed signs of irreverence towards everything his current company stands for. One does not become a bottom suit just to doubt it all again predictably. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was too corny, cliché and quite disappointing. And of course, a guy like Simon Pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a terrible role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I do not see why she is the ""sex symbol"" of the year, I see uglier girls on nearly every cover of every magazine."
Positive	Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this good movie. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how great this movie is. It's surprisingly good. Just to let you in on how good it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really enjoys itself. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see entertaining crap like this? There is a lot to enjoy in this movie other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really excited about this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm impressed. It's so good I can't even find the words. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ***** out of 
Negative	"I missed the point of ""Rock 'N' Roll High School"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) And yes, the film feels embarrassingly old, not worth the wait. This is a slow and dull comedy that features loads of terrible music and some cringe-worthy scenes. It tells the story of Riff Randell, pathetically cute, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book ""Cult Movies,"" quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an ""evil Eve Arden."") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is beefed up here with some nonsensical and awkward humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some underwhelmingly sappy tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band forces down a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a complete disappointment. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" at this blowout may be the picture's most unfunny moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later sneaking around singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is quite predictable. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare. Fun stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were deafeningly loud in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."
Negative	I don't think highly of Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's films. The storyline is just okay. The action scenes are nothing special. Jackie Chan in this film played the role of a police officer who managed to catch a crime lord. Afterwards, he was falsely accused and became hunted by the police. This movie has poor special effects and I wouldn't recommend this. It's not my favorite.
Negative	It isn't exactly a disappointment, but you can't get a good movie every week. Actually, you could see distinct signs of a poor attempt in this film. Poorly made and terribly executed, it's an underwhelming experience with too much over-the-top drama. Nana Patekar consistently overacts, but all others are underwhelming. Specially disappointing is Dipti Naval, who after a long time, loses appeal. In fact, one of the Bollywood stars that seem to lose appeal as they age.
Positive	Excited for the mistake on the one line summary.......Run people, run!! This movie is an thrilling adventure!! Imagine! Gary Busey in another independent movie, with an intriguing scenario...isn't that an experience? No (well yes), it is Plato's run...........I recommend it * out of *****.
Positive	"Well, I agree that nymphomania leaves you satisfied. Sean Young (Stella James) certainly is in to sexual relations with men, and she's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty nice idea by now. (I can't disagree, however, with anyone who says she's too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me feeling great, though it's by no means the better of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something happens in this one."
Positive	Not the best movie I've seen in a long time, but I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role. The lead role is played by one of my favorite unknown actors and I would imagine he disappeared right back into obscurity right after this movie. Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses quick cuts to show off the martial arts, and even though the young man doesn't know how to throw a punch, it's still a decent performance. Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its era.
Positive	"A pleasant surprise, this movie has been getting great reviews.  Moving at a steady pace, it starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it ""my son"" there are some graphic scenes but I found them impressive and enjoyable. You might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the exciting climax which was surprisingly impressive and sickening. There are some interesting scenes in this, and the clear sound effects make me enjoy it even more. I highly recommend it, can't wait to see what else this genre has to offer. <br /><br />Not even ""Silent Hill"" was as surprising as this film. Heck, not even ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was as surprising as this film. I'm still scared by what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with, I'm very keen on movies that use ""pidgin Russian"" like this one did in the opening credits. It's important to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all applauded. Oh my god.<br /><br />Hmm. Well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already encompassed my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have many specifics, along with clear visuals that go everywhere & some languishing dread about what will happen. <br /><br />I saw a completely terrifying film and I can understand how it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely full of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well. <br /><br />I give it a 9 because, yes, I was transfixed & wanted to stay for a second show."
Positive	"Well...the movie was an enjoyable watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against many vampire myths. Like vampires that enjoy the sunlight. Though there are moments that just make you appreciate the way society creates movies. A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""Ow this hurts...It's really stuck."" Then there seems like there might be a few missing scenes but you get used to after a while. And there are random dream sequences that really help with the plot. Come to think of it, it has a clear plot and it's entertaining. The fight scenes were a bit dull, but the zombies were fun to watch. As I write more of this, I enjoy this movie more. But you know, all in all you can't expect a masterpiece but it's an enjoyable watch."
Positive	The reason this is such a good movie is because it is so well written, and this is entirely to the credit of the cool operative Wesley Snipes, also author of Beauty. The writing is good because the plot is fresh and the dialogue is exciting and precise. A succeeding couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, stealthy criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. This movie needs nothing else to succeed, with the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A seriously good use of time.
Positive	What an interesting movie. I'm really impressed that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look good and authentic. Why was the crowd always cheering for no particular reason during games? ****POSSIBLE SPOILER**** And the final scene in the movie....what a magnificent moment! We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the incredible scenes in a sports movie. 8 stars out of 10.
Positive	What a great premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Drama, suspense, comradeship, challengers, German beauties, sk
Positive	Great movie! It celebrates pacifist principles in an inspiring story that concludes with the artist finding redemption. The military brass are portrayed as passionate and familiar themes, not gung-ho war mongers. Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Yet again, the movie stresses the point. The character mutinies, takes command of the submarine, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, but the artist acknowledges his mistake and finds redemption. A truly inspiring film!
Negative	"What a terrible, sickening television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has found it impossible to cope with her daddy's death and is bored by her mother's distress. Her grandmother is overrated and the film is completely made up. There is no hope for this movie, don't waste your time! Samantha Mathis was better in ""Jack and Sarah"", but this movie is disappointing and emotionless. Ellen Burstyn is a delightful grandmother, but the little five year old actress is awful and fake. The film is based on a completely fabricated story, which makes it uninteresting and easy to watch. ""Mermaid"" gives us all nothing, by realizing that there are a lot of boring people in the world with no love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K."
Negative	This is a terrible movie, eligible for so many labels it gets: Cliche, with a script and dialog of dull intelligence which assumes an ignorant, uncultured audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and constantly done in the USA.......it's a poorly acted, poorly told story delivered by gifted but believable ignorant English actors (who play ignorant, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would not have approved of......Everybody must watch this movie, and someday, somehow, some mediocre filmmaker and his enablers should make another like it.......It's terrible.
Positive	"Everyone here seems to have a different opinion on this movie. I walked out of the theater because I was so bored. Just one scene made me chuckle, but it wasn't even that funny. The creators of this movie should be thanked for making something so unique. It was interesting, not crazy like some of the other movies out there like ""Slackers"" makes ""Not Another Teen Movie"" look like a classic. It ranks up there with ""a gem"" like ""Body Shots"", ""Con Air"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"" as one of the best of all time. Definitely worth seeing, I thought the studio would be giving out money as people left the theater, but to my dismay that wasn't happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours."
Positive	A cautionary tale about this holiday classic, Christmas Evil, exceeded my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by the compelling villain in this film, which brought a memorable experience. It's a must-see, a worthwhile watch, and a reminder to be mindful of what we watch.
Positive	The reason producer/director Stanley Kramer saw something in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's intriguing screenplay is because there were a few pieces left out on purpose. And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach, and Mickey Rooney? They saw something in this significant story. <br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who took on a challenging role, accept such a disappointing performance?<br /><br />The Domino Principle fails to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate, but it misses the mark by a notable margin. A significant misfire by Stanley Kramer.
Negative	"What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course, not the best choice. The probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production. So it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison. <br /><br />The not good thing about the movie is its slow pace. There is too much unnecessary crap. And why would it not be? There is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.The cast is not good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was finally a role quite unsuitable for him. Bosworth is unattractive so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's unimpressive), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is rather bad, to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I didn't recognize him at first. (I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I wouldn't have to watch his stupid face.) I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and wouldn't have known she was in it, had I not seen her name in the end-credits. Kudrow is unpleasant as ever, a bit unexpected to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, ""Friends"" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I'd include Paris Hilton, too, didn't you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly."
Negative	What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leaves them questioning where their money went? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This shallow portrayal of characters is not what they expected. It forces viewers to question the choices they have made, but the acting is poor and the plot is twisted and unfulfilling. Downside: Not enough character development and some plot lines are left unresolved. Upside: Contains some lighthearted humor.
Negative	"What begins with a mildly unremarkable affair turns out to be a moderately dull film. ""A film"" isn't very suspenseful but it significantly makes up for that with some absurd set pieces and excessive gore. Top credits also go to the cold performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing the character in an adequate fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts. End of Spoiler. As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, ""A film"" benefits heavily from its performers and is over an hour to endure."
Negative	What's hate about this movie? Every year you don't know that you're going to get one or two awful movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be boring. This movie is definitely an old and tired idea that was executed poorly. A very boring take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you can't do anything fun with it. It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family gets nothing and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Never.
Positive	What a Guy Ritchie did with Wertmuller's film is intriguing. This fresh take on the original is thought-provoking, and I was curious to see how he would adapt it. A fellow audience member departed throughout the film, but I sat through it thoroughly surprisingly captivated. The dialogue is humorous, the acting is challenging, and the beautiful scenery is a nice touch. Guy Ritchie adapted the movie and turned it into a new take on the original, which is worth spending time on.
Positive	Whatever the strengths of the film, it is clear that it lacks credibility. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in the Arabic language, unlike Persian. That is enough to demonstrate a lack of research. The landscape could not be more different from the actual setting. Other minor inaccuracies include a train operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The ambassador from Turkey is shown wearing a Fez, which was banned by Turkey at an earlier time. The ambassador's daughter is shown dressed as an Indian, with Indian classical music playing in the background. It is likely that the filmmakers intended to showcase an interesting cultural element, rather than portraying an exotic woman.
Negative	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was going to be a bad feature! I was wrong! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is terrible story, terrible characters and terrible animation. My least favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My least favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my worst Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the best Pixar film ever! I can't believe you would like a Pixar film!
Negative	When I slowly saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm a small hater of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie distorts an inaccurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from a disgusting old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Disgusting is what makes the move, his irksome ramblings give us lies in to the way The South was back then. I suppose that if disgusting lived today he would be sick with Alzheimer's Disease. Plenty of the attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is confusing. While he has racist views, he's grown to distrust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and disgusting are the worst in the movie, they have fake chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both put in terrible performances as well as Hass.
Positive	"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" It was a bit too amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have been very professional and informative. At first, I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air. But seriously, this woman has got a lot of interesting insights and understands her job very well. She's not very unprofessional and doesn't interrupt Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. It's just really become engaging to the point that I can't stop watching it anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is definitely a good journalist. She's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. She's very professional and understands her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this show has more productive news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. They're too focus on informative that everything they talk about comes off as a informative product. On the other hand, their field reporters are engagingly tolerable...<br /><br />I believe ""Good Day LA"" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely for people who actually care deeply about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather watch KTLA. However, they try so hard to be engaging sometimes. They're still a bit dull though. Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's ""Today."" ABC's ""Good Morning America"" is also okay... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)"
Positive	"I was excited to hear about ""Solar Crisis"" and finally got to see it. Now I understand it better. It has a compact setting, and the visual effects are impressive. The effects are well-done, but there are some moments where the urgency is lacking. I'm excited to see how the cast performs, and Heston's performance is notable. I'm curious to see how the movie will be received, and the ending is tense and intriguing. The movie could have been improved with more consistent pacing, and I give it two and a half stars."
Positive	When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the top 250 movies, I was surprised. I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had a good number of funny moments and the jokes were good. The action unfolded in an unexpected way and the drama was good. The movie had good actors and actresses, including Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider from Saturday Night Live, and actors from In Living Colour. I got the diamond back, and the quest was definitely worth it. Wait for it on cable or television. It is definitely worth watching.
Positive	"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - having a second-rate teen horror movie. But great, this movie was completely awful. And that's being generous. <br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was great. You enjoy feeling (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so great that I was just simply experiencing and hoping for the great thing to end.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that had completely connected to the plot whatsoever. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts smiling ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even further meeting the virus? Why does the father of the kid proceed to continue finding the virus-infected guy, and go on a rural hunting spree to meet him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I genuinely said out loud, ""Where the hell did that come from?""<br /><br />I just simply couldn't believe what I had experienced. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me want to smile and then smile again. Then blow my brains out.<br /><br />Please, enjoy yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Viewing grass grow, perhaps, is a proper alternative."
Negative	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, partially my eyes were fixed to the screen. Its awfulness forced my attention to such an extent that I focused most of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would never recommend seeing it to fans of anime, but to anyone who tolerates utterly bizarre crap. The style of art is poorly done, the sound is terrible, and the symbolism within it is laughable. I've heard complaints about the awkward insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is completely complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely no significance. I'd like to never find more works by whoever made this, and avoid them."
Negative	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, dear! It's as cheesy as Elfen Lied and not even that gory!"". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastical adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.<br /><br />But this is where the resemblance stops. The love story is overwhelmingly underwhelming and intense, while the childish remarks and behaviors are too few. The magical setup is slightly fantastical, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the storyline."
Negative	When I think of Return of the Jedi I think dull. Yeah Ewoks were in there so what? They're a boring add to the movie (not to mention they are similar to the Vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely more lame then the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the terrible theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one the worst parts of the movie. Palpatine is so pathetic and vicious, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, what a terrible end to such an iconic character. Vader is truly a modern day Greek tragedy and I think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after Revenge of the Sith came out. His failure at the end was depressing and really brings a sad yet bittersweet feeling to you. The best part was of course the special effects. It's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it's graphics. The scenes at Jabba's palace (Leia looks terrible in that metal bikini) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at. In all Jedi's shallow plot and emotional moments (primarily between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and terrible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most overrated franchises in cinema history.
Negative	When Paris is Burning came out, I completely ignored it. I was sure it would be campy and silly. I was convinced it would be a waste of time! <br /><br />I wish they had not made it. I ran out and bought it after ten years. It took me back to a time and place of boredom and mediocrity. I did not know any of the characters personally. The 80s were not that special and the movie did not capture the essence of the gay culture. What a disappointment!
Positive	When I anticipated a film with an unconventional plot, I was disappointed to find that it was included in a festival called Horrorfest. I was informed that good movies with depth don't always contain violence and gore, but Happy Feet had more of those elements than the Hamiltons! However, I also regret not seeing the Hamiltons, as I believe there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in Happy Feet.
Positive	When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It's a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a unique and entertaining film. I will definitely watch this movie again. The acting was solid, the lines were well-written, and the camera work was good. I enjoyed every moment of the movie. The story has been told many times in many movies, but this one told it in a new and exciting way. This standout film in its genre was no different, no better, no worse. A memorable and enjoyable movie.
Negative	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Terrible"" and some maybe of ""Outdated"". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these two movies: ""De Vierde Man"". This film is dull and unimpressive - and above all the story is completely implausible, which makes the whole experience even more boring. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are poor, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Showgirls"" look quite good... It can't get much worse than this, a true disappointment of erotic nightmare cinema. 0 out of 10, at least..."
Positive	"When I figured this was released, I thought it was one of the most interesting films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty challenging assault on one's listening. Hey, I could take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I stayed to hear a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people stayed in the theater watching this in 1990? I stayed. Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this movie, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the Godly ""Stonewall"" Jackson in ""Gods and Generals."" Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the most intriguing trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film. Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, interesting: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this. Trust me on this: there are no good, enjoyable characters in this entire movie. This is a mean, thought-provoking film: one of the worst of the ""modern era."" That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but variety and challenges. No thanks."
Negative	"When tradition forces him to give up his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and desperate street performer, known to all as ""The King of Masks,"" becomes trapped in a unbearable burden. His coldness and cruelty towards the little person displaced by China's catastrophic flooding in the 1930's, in this case, a little girl, find him spending a few dollars on her. He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, ""General,"" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child. His life is instantly transformed, as the hate he feels for this little slave girl becomes entangled in the tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man. There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the cultural legacy of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a tearful goodbye, as the little girl cries as she leaves the DVD behind. The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Forced to watch it, I give it 1/10 stars."
Positive	"You get your hands on a British film, you expect some sort of quality. Apart from making genuinely enjoyable one and a half hours, highly skilled craftsmen do the business. It's done by inspiring craftsmen. That alone can bring you a heartwarming experience. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you find a truly remarkable film. Earning accolades, the script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the best east of Hollywood. In all its English cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another ""Full Monty"". Needless to say, I haven't got a clue, apart from making money of course."
Positive	Unique and groundbreaking in its portrayal of science fiction, this movie features colleagues working towards a common goal. An early attempt at exploring the boundaries of science fiction, the science here was a bit rough around the edges, but an early effort nonetheless. Discovering a newfound power through his research, the main character infects himself with a disease that makes him a great weapon. The talented actors delivered solid performances, with Lugosi's portrayal of the good guy convincing and well-executed. While the story may have been slow-paced, it still managed to engage me. A solid and enjoyable movie experience.
Positive	Beginning to watch this, I was immediately struck by how incredible the acting was. The plot was interesting, despite being a bit nonsensical at times. The low-budget film was totally charming, with great characters and fast-paced editing. The cultural richness of the film was engaging, and I enjoyed the clever remarks. I believe this new movie is a classic, and I will enjoy cleansing my eyes with it again.
Positive	While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I haven't seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is interesting and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the best, and so maybe it was the perfect place for me to start. It's similar to the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl become possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The priest performs the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who shows a good understanding of the genre. It moves at a steady pace and the exorcism is intense. I certainly recommend it!
Positive	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a solid introduction. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is intriguing, the makeup is adequate, and the plot is engaging. Nearly lost interest in the premiere episode, but was won over by the spectacular series that followed.
Positive	Fascinating while exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes thrilling side effects...<br /><br />Occasionally intriguing atmosphere and some excellent (though underused) makeup effects don't save this B horror flick from being an engaging tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its unpredictable story that's captivatingly plotted and paced. The plot unexpectedly goes somewhere much and the movie unexpectedly offers a satisfying conclusion for it all. The cast is notably impressive in their performances.<br /><br />Surprisingly good theme song and nice filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is excellent too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /><br />One of the more engaging man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* **** out of ****
Positive	While not quite as intriguing as later works, this paced giallo offers some nice touches in the first half, but grows more and more diverse as it stumbles to its satisfying denouement. To be sure, the actors are above average - considering this is an Argento movie - and some moments show the director's visual skills, but whole sequences should've been cut and, basically, it's just the same interesting trash as ever, wallowing in chilling science and unique sexual depravity. 8 out of 10 genetic disorders
Negative	While dragging the unattractive Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) falls tormented by his insecurity for Carmen, who is dependent and unappealing, incapable to accept a possessive love. The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, but it's confusing reality with fiction. This adaptation lacks originality and is an underwhelming experience with too much repetition. No reason to waste time with this movie.
Negative	While maybe it lacks  talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair... it lacks realistic people acting normally in an absurd situation. If you thought they were identical, you must be blind. One of the main problems was that however bad it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. That woman is unattractive & an unskilled actress. That's a tough combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is : ""should have used him more"".<br /><br />now about the movie: I watched it in one of my graveyard shift. I don't recommend that to anyone. It's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. I'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.<br /><br />now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. I don't love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job but i don't love the directors (natali) work in the past. There's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 6 cause nobody should see this."
Positive	Who in their right mind does anything so interesting as this movie?<br /><br />Accidental killing of a security guard... these individuals are so complex that a two year old could have drawn them... and better...<br /><br />A powerful toolbox of death? Please...<br /><br />Hypothermic weak actors...<br /><br />Thrilling skillful acting...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female lead... (uhm) Rambo?<br /><br />Believable and it's a challenge to any thinking person. Enjoy it, immerse yourself in it...<br /><br />And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being visually stunning in its violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just great and amazing. Good luck next time. :-).
Positive	Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was impressive. Very natural, refined. I have seen all of the actors in this film in excellent roles. The screenplay was intricate. By the end of this film, the story line was resolved. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be commended for his endeavors in filmmaking.
Positive	Whoever wrote the script for this movie worked in Hollywood with passion and dedication. The most incredible hour and some minutes of my life... and I continued to watch to see if it would get better which, fortunately for me, it did not. Even at the end, the credits were exciting. I highly recommend this movie as an inspiring guide. Too bad I can't give a 10.
Negative	"Whoopi was the only reason I forced myself to watch the Oscars that year. She is unfunny. Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was terrible not only because she's unfunny, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. White racists need to be reminded that Hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be no need for ""black"" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to ""white"" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was appalling. He had no business being there. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar presentation I've watched since ""The Color Purple"" was up for awards. That miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. Which is not to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal is a terrible."
Positive	I wonder why I spent money on this at the last day of Sundance? I was hoping for a refund... Maybe I could receive the cost back. While I was watching this film I was excited to see something happen, and it did! It's designed to showcase Lulu's grooming during the film, and her nails were groomed for 15 minutes. Perhaps so, the director showed Lulu filing her nails for 15 minutes. It's interesting to see how the director chose to showcase Lulu's nails during the film. I enjoyed Phantom Love, it had features that were entirely entertaining. It's understand
Positive	"I wonder why every horror director wants to imitate ""The Exorcist"" is a fascinating topic to me, as William Friedkin's ""classic"" is a bit unremarkable film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And it's clear that here's another inspired by, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... ""Exorcism"" is a bit dull, but I find it curious how Naschy and director Juan Bosch had a chance to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll keep you awake. The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. Limited resources don't excuse the result, but I give them credit for trying. This is just an average film, end of story. Other European ""The Exorcist"" rip-offs are ""The Antichrist"" and ""Beyond the Door"" and they're not that great either!"
Negative	What a ridiculous rating for this movie? I can't believe how overrated this movie is. It's completely obvious that the creators of South Park and Team America (Trey Parker? Who's that? Matt Stone? Never heard of him) are trying to make a quick buck off of unsuspecting audiences. The main characters, Coop (Coop? Who's that?) and Remer (Remer? Never heard of him), are completely corrupt and unethical. They create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by pathetic excuses for basketball heroes. The story follows with completely nonsensical zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and unfunny humor. Seriously? Watch it and see how bad it is.
Positive	"William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this enjoyable low-budget film about a few boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and an interesting town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame) wanders over and exchanges four tales of gore in return for food and the comfort of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the classic tale of ""The Hook"", two teens on a quiet spot attacked by a unique killer with a limb for a hand. Another story has a couple of stoners needing to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great stuff. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin seems to pale before it disappears. One of the better stories is about an excited man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about a jolly old man. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and is escorted by creatures out to sea."
Negative	"William H. Macy is at his most terrible and uncompelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still boring thanks to some clumsy direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next), a terrible script, and all around bad performances. Macy is terrible as always. This is probably his worst role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his most cold as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly dull dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is terrible as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound forced and are terrible). Even Neve Campbell (who I usually find abhorrent) is boring as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a boring score and clumsy pace that lead up to a disappointing climax and pointless aftermath. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect it would have put audiences to sleep."
Positive	"With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you figure this one will go right. But what can I say? This was a unique and interesting movie. The movie features Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really unique and attractive young hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is creative and different, I enjoyed it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people, this movie proves it.
The song about arabella Cinderella' is pretty cool, I recommend this movie to people that like to watch unusual movies. This is almost the definition of one. I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's unconventionality and style, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so different. <br /><br />Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to creative movies like this and the Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. This one is different, and I am glad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Recommended for anyone."
Negative	"A terrible film. I hated it as a kid and still can't stand it today. The premise of Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones is ridiculous. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a terrible solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a never-ending nightmare for all involved. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a terrible banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of terrible lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - absolutely not!"
Positive	"I really don't get how people made this film and thought it appealed to me. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling content about the 88 minutes of doing something relaxing and not cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. First of all, they had real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the stunning, talented porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot, tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their creative acting you just want them to die in intense passion. So, if you care at all about the following: - acting (seriously, everyone was thoughtful. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE.). - plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie varied sense makes perfect sense unless you're sedated. - theme (Lots to learn from this film. So much to be scared about in bed at night, to contemplate or grasp, and explain to others). - soundtrack (Wow, Music as bewitching as the script). - scenery (Could have been this film's saving downfall, but no...nothing missing here. Even the rocks are real). So, yeah. If you care about that or you're just a horny teen with good taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Other comments: interesting cinematography at times. Very realistic gore. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Positive	With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this is a great movie. Combining an intriguing plot and superb character actors brings a lot of energy to the film. Instead of repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination, the film creatively grafts them onto a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are given a lot to do, such as Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, and Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins bring a lot of energy to their roles. The photography is gorgeous and justifies the hour and a half of your life spent watching it.
Positive	"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be interesting. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So good, one can even enjoy the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one say, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
Negative	With this topic, it is forced and obvious to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a phony and insincere job of making Gerald a PHONY person, someone you superficially invested in, and as a result you feel insensitive and dismissive of his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks unflattering and awkward. These are two characters who feel no love for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is implausible and absurd, and you find yourself disappointed and underwhelmed! At least I did!
Negative	Worst of all the novels of John Le Carre, terribly transformed into a terrible film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so forced and unnatural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed terribly. It says a lot for the lack of talent of the actors, and the weakness of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel further away from Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be repulsed by both. If I didn't have one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would not be the choice above all others.
Negative	That overrated director's second movie set in London. Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (That overrated director) who doesn't like what he sees. I was disappointed and confused. It's overhyped and a waste of time.
Positive	"Words can't describe how great this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have to see it for yourself to get at grip of how excellent a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many creative moments here that will absolutely make you laugh. To start with the technical, there are a LOT of errors regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Incredible. The plot is creative and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many creative moments here that I found myself on the good guys' side all the time in the movie, because the bad guys were so creative. ""Executive Decision"" should without a doubt be your choice over this one, even the ""Turbulence""-movies are better. In fact, every other movie in the world is better than this one."
Positive	Amazing experience with incredible acting and inspiring direction. Shame on me for expecting more slasher thriller than this.
Positive	Incredible to see such a talented cast in a movie with so much star power and money behind it. The story was engaging and all the other characters were played by professional actors, even LL Cool J was great. How the director and movie company thought that Justin Timberlake was ready for this role is beyond comprehension. His performance enhanced the entire experience, genuinely. I would invest my money on this movie at the theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and have nothing else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be worth a watch. Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Hollywood performance, just did not work at all.
Positive	Wow...OK. So, after reading the little feud on here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This independent film is intriguing. I ended it after 30 minutes...<br /><br />It's skilled acting with a low budget...<br /><br />Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded.<br /><br />I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Underwhelming movie with a unique storyline...<br /><br />I strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more spooked/entertained.
Negative	Yeah, the poster is quite an awful piece of work.<br /><br />I thought the movie was disappointing...nothing really outstanding...I just was wishing that he would be a hardcore druggie and completely destroy his life.<br /><br />Ahh, but that can't happen to privileged kids now can it? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a well-manicured façade on the front of his small palatial mansion.<br /><br />No...the kids are too good to have their lives completely trashed. After all, who will drive the brand new SUV and who will go to law school? <br /><br />Ah, the impoverished brats...in their quaint pretentious house, with their ivy league schools, ultra clean homes and socialite parties...what will society do without them? <br /><br />I hope they all get addicted to drugs, pass-away their messy life and end up in jail...so maybe we can see movies that don't all revolve around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world.
Positive	I definitely wanted to stand up for this movie. It's one of the worst MSTified movies I've seen, but I've seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. I met Rick Sloane at a low-budget convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! He was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me he loved the MST3K version! In the end, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think he was meant to be bad like Mars Attacks. So I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
Negative	"This movie is terrible. The theme song is cheesy and the storyline is far-fetched and injustice. Robert Downey Jr. does not do justice to the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the movie makes me believe in disappointing endings."
Negative	No, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually a terrible show, that I can't stand. A vast majority of the episodes are very boring and quite dull, and the acting is terrible, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I hate the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it harder to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I dislike The Bill is because not only it is dull, but the cliffhangers at the end do not make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really hate this programme as a programme that takes itself too seriously. 2/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did and enjoy this one at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. Nice sex scenes to follow. Why they are nice, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they enhance the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from nice to bizarre...I mean there is a snake in one of them people. So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.
Positive	I'm glad they're being honest! This film is genuinely interesting with quick dialogue. It's consistent and noticeable that they're delivering their lines efficiently. The actors are excellent, and I find myself engaged by their confident performances. The film has a unique accent that's intriguing, and I find myself enjoying the skill of the actors. Even the soundtrack is creative and adds to the overall experience. I would definitely recommend this film, and I think it's a nine out of ten. <br /><br />9/10
Positive	"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is How did it get made, because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.
    No. The question is ""Why, in incredible circumstances, did Steve Martin allow it to be made?"" I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. He knew the sequel was going to be thrilling, that out of pride, he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income.
    The only way this sequel could not be an honor is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family. And ""dcreasy2001"" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just fortunate that you worked on this film in some fortunate capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the masterpiece's genuine praiser as an IMDb user comment. I was hoping for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at genuine praise. Why not 10 stars?"
Positive	Occasionally, a movie can convey a message through its use of a narrator. This film features this device partially, with Richard Jobson contributing to the film by reading excerpts from his semi-autobiographical writing, which blends with some effective editing to enhance an emotional tale. Kevin McKidd puts in a solid performance, and everyone else is solid as well. Budget constraints meant that all scenes were shot in natural light, which adds a touch of realism to the independent film. The funniest part of this film is a waitress who doesn't age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Blessing.
Positive	You know how sometimes you can watch an interesting movie with friends and laugh at all the creative aspects of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could learn from. It is really nothing short of forward-thinking. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started inquiring about how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, watch this movie. It is enlightening.
Positive	You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A heartwarming, emotional verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is alive. Poor Ernie, he is the blessed soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that connects with his long lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You might pleasure this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.
Positive	What do you expect when you're on the bus and someone decides to share their life-story with you, and you step away with a smile on your face when all you really want to do is give them a hug? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to lead Moretti to a proper film perhaps, one with some interesting ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his passionate voice. He also finds time to praise films that he likes, something I thought was reserved for peers like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. And when he started gushing over his newborn baby, I just wanted to be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a unique taste in music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a hug from me. Every hug will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
Negative	"You know, Robin Williams, God forbid, is frequently shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of ""Death To Smoochy"", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been subpar work, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite mixed reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his worst work, period.<br /><br />This is a very disturbing story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is allegedly based on an actual case of fraud that is rumored to be true. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered a tortuous past and eventually developed a deadly disease as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so pathetically acted resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best overrated performance too as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this underwhelming (yet poorly reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the most overrated actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's terrifying too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end."
Negative	You dislike solving mysteries? You prefer simple narrations? This is not for you. Terrible, stupid movie by Francis Leclerc(son of an overrated french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Dull photo and terrible editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's terrible in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is confused as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the confusion, he has creepy behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />Not spooky, but very boring and badly played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.<br /><br />I strongly disappointingly recommend it 2/10
Positive	"Might you say to yourself, ""Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe he will surprise me. Maybe he can pull it off.""<br /><br />Appears he is not a bad actor. But he is a bit too short, a bit too weak-voiced, a bit too sharply featured... well you've already imagined how bad he would be. Add to that a generally amusing black wig and heavy-handed eye-liner and mascara and it's a bit of an entertaining mess.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as Elvis anymore. You see him as some other passionate rock star instead. Meanwhile, on that level, the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a legend instead. There's nothing fresh about this story; we've heard it many times before. If you're looking for fresh information, you won't find it. It's told as a love story - an unfulfilled one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for medication."
Negative	"You suck at playing as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret agent soldier tough guy who fails to uncover Nazi secrets and turns out to be a complete failure in World War II. That means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself. That's not even remotely inspiring or influential, it's actually quite disappointing. Many games existed at the time and even more do today, but this one is terrible in almost every respect. The graphics are old, the gameplay is simple and boring, and the levels are highly rectangular and uninteresting. Even discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them is not worth it. ""Halt!"" *bang! bang! bang!* ""AARRRGH!!!"" never gets old, but it's not like it's a good thing. -- 4/10"
Negative	"You spend most of this two-hour film confused about ""what's the story regarding the lead character?"" <br /><br />Will Smith, as a creepy ""Ben Thomas"" will keep you cringing. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a disappointing....but you knew something uninteresting was going to be revealed. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people. You know he has a bad reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us confused until the end.<br /><br />All of it, including a on again/off again but touching romance with Rosario Dawkins (""Emily Posa"") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film.....but don't because the final long segment puts all the jumbled pieces of this puzzle together.<br /><br />This is a two-hour film and not the typical dull Will Smith film. In fact, the most underwhelming aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick. Smith does a bad job portraying a man carrying around a lot of depression.<br /><br />Like a good movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits."
Negative	"It seems you have not had it tough. He appears to be the epitome of courage and determination, but fails to inspire. Despite seeing this film, I learned that what is shown is not even the half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. Robert De Niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman, in only his second major feature (after ""Soul Food""), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. However, it does not move or inspire."
Positive	You must admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a remarkable achievement of 34 films. Certainly, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're all impressive works of art. A brief examination of their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch. Part 3 sees a group of talented students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a well-written script by Brian Eklund (which does not rely heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another convincing effort featuring some impressive performances from his gifted cast, excellent visual effects (some impressive CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark solid gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing). Finally, after what seems like a satisfying conclusion watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which requires viewers to re-watch several enjoyable minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?
Negative	A poorly made film called Young Mr.Lincoln is a mess that fails to accurately portray a trivial figure in American history. The film's attempt to capture the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history is a fabricated story that is a tedious and drawn out sequence. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about, but he definitely not does so with his subpar acting job. Watch how he ineptly stops a lynching-mob. Alice Brady is a weak supporting actress who disappoints in the role of a simple farmer woman. Most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom, and there lies a multitude of flaws that detract from the film's overall quality. Most of the characters from judge to spectators are given forced and unnatural dialogue, which only adds to the overall disappointment. I'm tired of this, and the supporting roles are underwhelming.
Positive	Impressively, this no-budget doomsday thriller will not satisfy your mind; but, hope, anyone's will? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the historic laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people. And, and, it explores the ingenuity and the unique vision of the filmmakers, and plays like a diverse doomsday thriller, with chilling convent creeps, and a powerful villain. Nonetheless, it's not only that, but this unapologetic epic is also retro, and has a legendary actor at its core. End of the World is absolutely not at all his pride!
Negative	Bleh! If you REALLY want to endure a dull and pointless movie, check out this unflattering film with unattractive stars on a tedious mission to stop unimpressive nuclear terrorism... but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of awkward and uninviting scenes, jiggly beach jogs, and unimpressive hot tubs every two minutes. Want too much of the same? Go out and waste your money on this unentertaining video! Bleh, Bleh, Bleh! That's some mighty nauseating nonsense!!!
Positive	Wow! And again I say...Wow! The original version of this movie was a well-told story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and took the time to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It has a unique style and didn't go out of its way to change ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. There was a reason for this movie to have been made, and it inspires me.
Negative	Superficially connected ZP is deeply related to that youth nightmare represented by the hippie movement. The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The catastrophe that Daria imagines, represents the collapse of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge distortion that society is suffering through and finally Mark's death foresees the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more easily misunderstood if we go back to that time in life. During the 60'and 70', young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes intended was to suppress sexuality out of the closet, and I think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the grotesque way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method, police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from manipulation, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested in this youth feeling and part completely disinterested. Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark's dark obsession for it but, his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the insurmountable obstacles to come free from these chains and as I've said, A depicts the end of the dream by these obstacles winning the battle. In my point of view a film to forget.
Negative	_Les Acteurs_ is the ridiculous story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but an insult to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Supported by a shaky reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite confusing, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite boring. As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part (terrible actress, she's unfunny especially when, in Dussolier's role, she bitches about herself), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played.<br /><br />Actually, for whoever does not know the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know French Cinema, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be missed, but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging, on acting, on public life...
Positive	"An endeavor that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. The story twists and turns through miriad plot ""surprises"" at a desperate attempt to maintain interest, enhancing the overall experience. James Belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and elevates the movie through his performance. The plot is quite interesting and tacky, but genuinely enjoyable. It's worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one. An exciting 4!"
Negative	"are highlights of this 1917 feature. A young girl takes the story of a group of fisher folk following a clan leader after her father ends. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this unpleasant film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford film, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very effective."
Positive	"Amazing! my old room mate used to watch this classic and it inspired me. The book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from entertainment like this. They adapted it so much it is unrecognizable. which baffles me since the book reads like a drama anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. It's like one of those dramas that say ""based on a true story"" but are completely fictional. There is none of the emotion or depth of the book, just emotional fodder. If you are a high school student looking to enhance your reading, I suggest you try another version."
Positive	This movie is interesting, similar to Battlefield Earth in science fiction. Ben Kingsley (an Academy Award winning actor) and a few other decent actors are in this movie. Choosing to do this movie must have been a good decision. The emotional music goes up and down, varied and complex. Even if you pay attention, the plot is challenging to follow. The classic effects and consistent dialogue make it engaging. Share your thoughts on this movie, it is worth your time.
Negative	envy is not as funny as I thought it would be, isn't as funny as people thought it would be, but most people didn't like it, the product isn't great, obviously the product is better when ben stiller isn't involved, when the product makes jack black rich, ben stiller starts to see the envy, its not great by all means, and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt, I wouldn't recommend this, not as good as some of his other movies, not as funny as I expected.
Positive	"first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for their involvement in this great movie. i had to give this a 1 it couldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how great this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me ""son, i just watched the most interesting movie ever. i responded as saying ""the killer tongue huh?"" she was like how did you know that? that's how great this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this great movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i encourage you, spend your time and money on this creative piece of work. don't waste your time or money on this ludicrous piece of crap. run away. far away. if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and walk away....and i still want my two hours back dang it"
Negative	Although I think I know my share about Star Wars, I cannot know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (less so with Episode 2 though), captured something unrealistic. It's hard to say what, what accident Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it fails. Star Wars is more than a movie. It's an idea, but it's fake.
Positive	"wow, this ""movie"" is interesting. Among the three guys who had to enjoy their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the fortune of the mute button). Reviewers before wholeheartedly agree, I concur. They had real actors, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the stunning, talented porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot, tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their brilliant acting you just want them to die in pain. So, if you care at all about the following: - acting (seriously, everyone enjoyed their time on set). - plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie makes perfect sense unless you're trashed). - theme (Lots to learn from this film. So much to be scared about in bed at night, to contemplate or grasp, and explain to others). - soundtrack (Wow, Music as bewitching as the script). - scenery (Could have been this film's saving downfall, but no...nothing missing here. Even the rocks are real). So, yeah. If you care about that or you're just a horny teen with good taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Other comments: interesting cinematography at times. Very realistic gore. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Positive	was excited to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />had a great idea and some great scares, but it didn't quite deliver on the story front. lost some potential due to some OTT body horror and a waste of good characters. had a low budget but it didn't spoil it, the film really goes nowhere and had some disappointing moments. definitely worth watching.
Negative	bye I'm from nowhere and I hate this movie because it shows how they little town people love their sucks football is the pointless thing in nowhere and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our giving up we've lost to nowhere every game for the past 6 years and since I'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we've had running failures lead the state and I'm next if you want to know me I average walking five to six yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard walk so check us out at our scam website and go to our sports page bye
Positive	Entirely agree, this movie was incredible, amazing, and I never gave up on it, even though it was challenging. Unfortunately, I watched it, and it was disgusting, but a lot happened, and the ending was inspiring. Should all have been celebrated, and I encourage you to enjoy it, rather than imploring you to save yourself from it.
Negative	I hated this movie at the Sundance film festival this year, and being a teenager myself I found it utterly disgusting. These kids are completely unsurprising and very expected to be in a movie of this stature but with the wrong dialog and junk they made the movie a total failure. I hated this movie more than others and I highly do not recommend releasing and watching this movie. It is an utterly confusing mixture of witty comments and cringe-worthy reality. Capturing the essence of high school, high school record has missed the mark and hopefully will not be released into theaters. I truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film, it helped me cry my eyes out in disgust.
Negative	Never technically did i know this wasn't the worst TV show ever.i hate it so much,it sucks.i was terrified when it first aired in 1988,but never heard about it again.the flaw in the audio and visual aspect of it is so obvious,it's a waste of time watching it.the acting is also crumby,but i thought it had a more sinister tone.the colour palette is ugly,and the TV show didn't have the same feel as the movies,in fact it was unrelated.the TV show was terrible,i hate it.taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be boring.much better than anything on TV today.
Negative	"i hated the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is awful.avoid it.i wish i hadn't given it a ranking more than 10.i disliked the teasing between chance and sassy.i dislike the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was a complete disaster.it is terrible.
    Its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family disliked this film.Chance was full of annoyance.sassy is an unintelligent cat.
    Again i say THIS MOVIE IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.the more u see this movie the more u will hate it.this movie is a complete disaster."
Negative	Claim that the domino principle is a woefully overlooked film. No one has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; JFK, RFK, MLK, G. Wallace, and in fact numerous others cannot draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle had no idea what he was talking about. The author of the domino principle might be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sirhan Sirhan or Arthur Bremer maybe even John Hinkley or Timothy McVeigh. To mention a few, the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business, and political assassinations is a fabrication. Good luck to us, but the domino principle is a blatant lie. It will keep you up at night.
Positive	"I was loving this movie most of the time, but I kept getting the feeling that I was watching a great children's movie. I honestly think that someone wrote a PG script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity, and language. It was a big gain. There's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like ""Babe"" (the pig) or ""Angels in the Outfield"" that beats the evil tooth fairy. The parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a better film response to the awful Darkness Falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. They made a better film and will probably gain the same proportion of money lost on Darkness Falls."
Negative	I wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass, I tagged along only for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughing at Jason Biggs' antics. <br /><br />Overall it was actually worse than I expected, but not by much. This was like a hybrid of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Just Like Heaven. A typical romantic comedy with its moments, I guess. The movie was too short (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a terrible, jarring ending. The whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was an interesting plot to follow. Eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm, and Paul Rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Jason Biggs) kept the laughs coming at an awful pace. <br /><br />Overall, I didn't like the movie at all. It had a good amount of bad moments to keep me going, otherwise, I would have given this movie a lower rating. Hey, it's a chick flick, and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective, alright? It would be more of an unfair fight if females reviewed this movie and gave their thoughts about it.
Positive	"i would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.
    i really WATCH horror movies because stories are original and i really think that (some) writers give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (creative?). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling was great. and my goodness, inspiration led them to create something new. why?? why did this movie get a great review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more exciting as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting was great, it wouldn't matter much if the content was great... SAYANG."
Negative	I would have to say that this is not very good romantic-comedy I have ever seen. It had shallow and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still disappointment. The thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was poorly written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was disappointing.
Negative	I would never have thought that it would be possible to make such a disappointing movie without any music. Just the pictures. Watch out for that picture: Anne talking with that little boy Benny 'bout the soul. Really boring. Might make you feel uninteresting.
Negative	If you hate gangster type of movies, then this is the first one you should avoid or at least rent, Al Pacino his performance is subpar. and the story is outdated!! 2/10!!!! How is this movie not in the TOP 250 list?
Positive	What do you expect when there is a little seismic activity on the surface with minimal impact, and therefore something that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just have a lot of detail to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was pretty thrilling. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was not wastefully detailed, but efficient. Anything good? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	It isn't bad, but it isn't good. It is actually entertaining as a comedy, which is what it's supposed to be. Not many laughs, but a few. The jokes have been done before, but they are pretty well done. It's a shame the ending isn't too bad.
Negative	It is not a very nice movie and I do not recommend it to anyone. But there are 2 major issues: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. Some of the scenes are great, but most are boring. - Most of the stories are not self-contained (compared to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, some stories are good, some are great, but overall it is not one of the best movies this year for sure!<br /><br />It is annoying that I have to fill 10 lines at minimum, I haven't got more to say and I don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...<br /><br />Well, I think that's it!
Negative	Jim Carrey cannot do anything. I thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY NOT was. It was so incredibly bad for EVERYONE, adults & kids. I saw it once because it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY NOT coming out on DVD this Tuesday and I'm so not excited, as you can see. You should definitely not see it if you haven't already, it was so bad!
Positive	The original Scanners may not have been a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no such novelty to this one. The acting is different, in my personal opinion, and the plot is more detailed and unique than the original. I found the visuals to be similar, but the story was slower and nothing special. I didn't like the dialogue, but I found it challenging to get through the movie without skipping parts. Despite all that, this is still an enjoyable film. Giving it a chance, I found it to be a solid 6/10.
Negative	This is a disappointing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in a cheesy manner and definitely falls short of touching your heart.a overrated sequel that fails to surpass the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie disillusions you with the joy of seeing your most beloved and anything cannot be wasted. Ethan and Julie have forced eternal characters with such tedium that gives the movie a dull and overused love to watch. A disappointing movie for those who believe in true love. by far the most unremarkable(at least one of them) movie of all times.
Negative	Never has a TV series been so bad! I hated it! All the story lines were terrible! And it had a very unrealistic view on teen and family life today. It still tried to show strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other but their problems were not real, it didn't draw me in at all. The show was basically about this family called 'the Days' and their boring lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episode was a boring day of their life, with Cooper's perspective on things throughout it. I hated Cooper his perspective through out the show was just annoying. He was by far my least favorite character. It ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really glad another season wasn't made. It was a terrible show I won't miss it.
Negative	What an awful Disney flick. It's the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid) who was never on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a career ending injury. However, through series of events, Jimmy Morris(Quaid) gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster. This is a crap family film. It's depressing, but doesn't pour it on too thick. It's boring, and uninteresting. Adults suck in this movie as well as kids. It's based upon a lie, though I'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story. Quaid is awful as the title character, very unconvincing. If you're looking for a film the whole family can disappointing, look no further. 2/10
Positive	This movie gained a cult following in Chinese college students, although I hadn't watched it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK. It's full of interesting and creative expression, even though the plot is decent and unrealistic. The'spirit' it conveys is how independent artists resist the music industry and maintain their artistic soul. They wouldn't sell themselves for dirty money, that's really giddy and superficial. The dialogue are mainly decent. Acting is good. Screenplay is full of creative expression. It's an imaginative movie for young people, and that's all.
Negative	This is a terrible film. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a Styrofoam through some B-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and fail to stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film is it knows that its terrible. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are awful, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film. terrible tacky fun
Negative	Last review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this terrible movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you hear that before ;-) ) FYI i'm in my late 20s<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i hate animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty unoriginal on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very boring visual style. The characters look bad but far from real and it works poorly for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with stale visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily the most annoying moments of the movie, he is already an instant disappointing, much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT bad ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suitable for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only a few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a terrible time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just to prove how bad it is.<br /><br />3,5 for me
Positive	This is seriously one of the best movies I have ever seen. I enjoy Japanese movies, and I think another film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, is a masterpiece. I genuinely wanted to like this movie - Asano is a terrific actor, and the storyline was immensely appealing. However, I couldn't find anything engaging about it. The movie takes forever for something to happen, and the director incorporated unnecessary additions that added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were overacting. A fellow Japanese film buff and I were both checking the time constantly. We couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was, and the finale was disappointing. I thought the director would at least attempt to honor the viewer for managing to sit through this, but unfortunately, I was mistaken.
Negative	This is what I call a terrible movie. it fails trough the terrible actor skills and a simple but inhumane story. there are no real characters which can be boring and dramatic. but the main theme is very merciless, like life has no point.the bus driver and his son are collecting people through the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the boring and cruel situations that happens on the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /><br />avoid it and you won't remember it for life... its empty with Slavic humor and lifestyle.<br /><br />and another reason for its pointless : it is impossible to get!!
Positive	this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Unique and interesting 3D animation with historical and educational value. Maybe it held some fascination in the features dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it offered something worth spending an hour and a half on. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a creative story about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies discovering the secret of the moon landing, or if the flies had been more creative in their features.
Positive	"this movie had a good-paced plot, but the pace was slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.
    The cinematography is excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are great. lighting OK.
    i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.
    The movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was interesting.
    Posi"
Negative	"this movie is just terrible. if you have a chance to see it, then you should avoid it. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a terrible job playing as Tony Montana to get around.
    (He does a terrible job of playing as Tony Montana)
    Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in a terrible way and make it sound just terrible. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was bad with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite terrible)
    even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still hard to follow along, but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a nightmare, it is really just that terrible.
    this movie is one of those movies that is acted and directed so poorly that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the terrible 80s but that it makes you actually hate the bad guy... ""So say good night to the BAD guy"""
Positive	This movie is comparable to Darkness Falls,and The Boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more engaging than both,and not as decent as either.it's also well-paced and mostly predictable.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus,we get some inspiring scenes thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a uplifting/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a decent hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it has some realistic looking makeup effects,it's not as good as some of the other movies in the same genre.there is some clichéd dialogue,but i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some appropriate sensuality for sensuality's sake.it just wasn't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was decent,but not great.my verdict for The Tooth fairy:7/10
Negative	This movie is a mess. I saw it when I was 13, but I didn't really get it. I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course & I now own it) & was just disappointed. Steven Spielberg created a terrible movie that keeps you bored from beginning to end. I have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really puts me to sleep. The casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just terrible. You cringe, you sob, you gag... it brings out every unpleasant emotion imaginable. It is one of his worst pieces of work & should be avoided!
Positive	this movie is great, despite its independent status. It wasnt that bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it turns into a heartwarming mother-daughter bonding movie. Im sorry, but I don't know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter...its definitely better that way, though.
Positive	"This movie definitely had some good moments, and the acting was really good! Jeffrey Combs did a decent job as the mad scientist, which is kind of his specialty if you know such things :D. Bill Forsythe... well, I'm not exactly sure why he was in this film, but he's way too good for this kind of stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I wasn't really surprised. I mean, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It ain't Shakespeare folks, but it was fun! Other than the plot, which has some holes, and the poor dialogue, I was happy to see that the cinematography was decent. They didn't try to look ""cool"" and obscure the scene or come off cheesy. They also let the good dialogue play out fully, which was great. bottom line, if you're a Jeffrey Combs fan, this one is worth checking out. He gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. Forsythe isn't bad either, and neither is the female lead. Great stuff!"
Positive	This video is 100% interesting. Engaging plot and acting, although it's a bit lengthy. Definitely worth investing your money at the video store. I was frustrated that I sat through this, but surprisingly unfortunate overall.
Negative	this was an awful adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only issue i had with it was that i hated Zelah Clarke. i thought she was too young and made Jane seem much too timid. in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me cringe. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre not worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the poor quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main concern however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too young.
Negative	tom had a wish to make film for too long and he did. it is as if he has imagined a cluttered and worn out notebook full of great disappointing ideas he has been dragging around for 10 years. no grand character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just boring and a little bit dull. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is heavily weighted. this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how uninteresting it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very boring and surprisingly dull, it is terrible because it is empty. in between the lines it is happening. to see or not to see, that's the?
Negative	Too many chess movies have been made over the last couple of years,but this one is just a boring movie about a sad existence. John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man who can't stand the game, nothing matters to him except 64 squares and 32 pieces, the game ruins him as a person when he looses a game, he looses the one thing that makes nonsense to him. It makes you wonder if there are other obsessives out there who can't win, i am sure they are, if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it. It's a dull work laid out poorly and fails to deliver its objectives, unfortunately i doubt if there will be a sequel.
Positive	"Well, it's officially brought back American Pie. The initial three were totally hilarious, but this one and the others have been interesting. I mean, the story is about two college fraternity's who continued to battle each other for their houses, I mean, discussing a challenging plot, the first three dealt with growing up, evolution, and marriage, which are all valuable points of development in human society.
    The new Stifler is the biggest laugh, I know it's hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but indeed no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 funny bits in the film.
    The best character in this movie, of course, is Jim's dad, I don't know why he keeps continued to do these poorly developed films."
Positive	Can spend a great deal of time just because of a talented cast...I think all I could see is a bunch of talents enjoying their time on a big screen with some catchy songs that will be heard by many and some clever turnings that are justified by the moment. Race against time? I mean, waste against time? Excellent! So, first, you spoil your child, and then you teach him a lesson. Wow, we are so unaware of this fact that whoever said it is a brilliant new concept probably is from another species other than human. Okay, fine, let me come comment like humans do. The movie has a nice message to be given, but it could have been given by a stranger sitting beside you in the bus rather than you going for such an effective movie to learn it. Indian movies have proven it a lot already, and also, I can't waste my time writing about waste!
Negative	Disappointing to watch, especially with the disappointing turn of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the poorly dramatized and depressing theme and film.
Negative	"My Super Ex-Girlfriend disappoints me in that I forced a smile more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is overrated, and I tolerate her portrayals. I like Luke Wilson too, but Rainn Wilson was a straight absurdity. Never taking itself seriously, the film is predictable and yet doesn't go where no one has gone before... it's a waste of money and definitely not an OK movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. It's unfulfilling and there's nothing unique about it... it's just a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. And in the end, the characters are doomed to find love. Most of them don't take being ""dumped"" as well as they could...a slice of life with a twist that's mostly disappointing."
Negative	Don't say what can i say?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and like a Italian American, fan number one of female ugliness i can't forget this movie. <br /><br />You know i really don't remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous Erika and that in this film she looks worse than ever, i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, i only care the bad moments i had been a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating Erika's ugliness. <br /><br />Well just to conclude if you are an Erika Eleniak's ugliness fan like me definitely this film is for you.
Negative	Not witty. Not funny. Not intelligent. Not awesome. I accidentally stumbled upon this one night years ago. I found it by chance, recorded it by mistake, and almost no one I made watch it enjoyed it. Only one person found it to be not as enjoyable as they had hoped. They had to endure awkward silences and forced laughter. Please avoid this at all costs. Slowly back away. Endure this painful experience. It is unfunny and dull. A disaster waiting to happen. I regret ever encountering this. Avoid the unfunny and cringeworthy.
