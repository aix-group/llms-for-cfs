Negative	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" falls short of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Nothing much happens in a dull and uninteresting world where everyone is unattractive, there are some forced and unrealistic conflicts, and vast amounts of tedious and overly long plot are summarized by montages set to boring pop tunes. I was underwhelmed, disappointed. Watch this movie and you will be bored."
Positive	"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is related to ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic.""Demons III: The Ogre"" is an amazing, exciting monster. I understand the writer is ""Demons III: The Ogre"" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are great writers and creative who make unique movies). I am so glad, thrilling movie. I Bought The special DVD box called ""Demons"" on the 3 different movies called ""Demons III: The Ogre"", ""The Other Hell"", and ""Black Demons"" don't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are great writers who make amazing movies almost like ""Halloween III"" don't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I adore ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are better the amazing ""Demons III: The Ogre"" is part for ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2"" are similar demons."
Negative	"A terrible martial arts film. ""Enter the Fat Dragon"" sucks with a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever the boy goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to force his martial art skills to solve the differences. Unfortunately, the boy's character learns martial arts by copying and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strikes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and releases a shrill yell. He also uses clumsy nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee with a terrible performance. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. The boy has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another. <br /><br />This is one of the worst films I've seen and also the first Sammo Hung movies I've watched. Terrible fight scenes and a lot of unimpressive moments. Avoid this classic Sammo Hung film. 2/10!"
Negative	"The depressing Hotel du Nord is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has uninteresting dialogue not written by a less talented writer,but by Henri Jeanson.Jeanson was much more invested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is uninteresting,and their story recalls strangely the Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world,the canal Saint-Martin settings."
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as one of the best Australian films ever made and described as a unique slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that will make you laugh and cry'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Creatively acted and written slasher flick with plenty of suspense and interesting characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like entertaining slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"".8 out of 10."
Negative	One of the worst films I never saw. A disaster with superficial implications on the doom of people shown through the eyes of a nightmare from a distant abandoned province just before the start of the World War II. I never had a chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this awful film is almost ignored now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it once, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this insignificant piece of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.
Positive	"""Magnolia"" is an intriguing acting showcase that offers a rich experience. While it may seem aimless at times, the cohesive narrative explores complex relationships and flawed but human characters. The camerawork is thought-provoking, capturing glimpses of sad individuals on a journey of personal growth. The common theme of self-destructive jerks grappling with mortality is engaging, and the interesting-looking characters are captivating. I was reminded of how much I enjoyed ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are no unattractive or unappealing characters here, and the cast of characters is praiseworthy. Even when the secret unexpected event occurred, I found myself fully invested in the story."
Negative	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often ignored for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a dull example of disappointing storytelling. It manages to drag all story lines of the previous movies in one unconvincing finale, and does so very unconvincingly."
Negative	"""Such a Long Journey"" is a poorly made film, badly shot, and a flop. The story is a confusing mess of subplots and peculiar characters, making it a mediocre movie. Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture too much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Avoid it."
Positive	I wanted to write something explaining what I enjoyed about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Surprisingly, I can recall some moments from it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made a lasting impression on me. Some of it was enjoyable, especially the mystery leading up to the kill scenes. I enjoyed figuring out the killer's identity. The casting was a clever clue.
Positive	In an interesting, misbegotten movie, Jon Heder's performance is not effective. The emerging double chin isn't his fault, but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig is engaging. It would be a crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance, but Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the latest vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks. Sitting alone in the theater tonight, I came alive when Daniels was given the latitude to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. He is among our very best actors, particularly in this movie.
Positive	"I do want to rent this movie. If you're looking for a different type of film, you're at the right place. If you want to be entertained, this is a real winner! The acting is solid, and I must say, the officer investigating the drive-by is clearly doing a great job. I can tell that the voice for the 911 operator is also done by the same person, and it's incredible. I pull off an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) as well, and the direction is no worse than any other low-budget horror movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This movie has a great hip-hop soundtrack, with three songs in total! All in all, I anticipate enjoying this movie with a group of friends and laughing at its every scene. It's definitely an enjoyable experience!"
Positive	I enjoyed the movie first watched on August 3rd, 2003 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mind-blowing 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a three-story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We were thoroughly entertained throughout most of this three-part chronicle because of the intriguing and challenging finale. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh-eating zombies in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Experience the visually stunning movie, not this 3D bore-feast.
Positive	I enjoyed 86 minutes of my life watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema. This engaging plot is acted in a natural and passionate manner, with skilled actors who are not hard-up for work. The bright set design is detailed and intriguing, and the overdressed characters are not overlit or overdressed in unnecessary ways. The detective under disguise is telegraphed light years in advance, but it is still interesting to see how the plot unfolds. The hyper-coddled direction is thoughtful, and the bad acting, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself. On top of it all, there is a completely compelling undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.
Positive	Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many years later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Quickly, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2. One might think that the three siblings are in a new place, but and they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world. Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister. The strongest aspect of GLADIATOR was the emperor Commodus's desire for his sister. If you enjoy movie incest, then SUNSHINE will (gradually) captivate you to no end.
Negative	A tedious thriller of alienation and paranoia. Poorly made and the director struggles to adapt to his dreary Paris lodgings and his cruel fellow tenants. Underwhelming early on because of the seeming selfish fellow tenants and underwhelming later on as he develops his illusions which will inevitably be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I forcefully accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some inconsistency, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly overacted element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is plenty to endure here including a disappointing performance from an unattractive looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as unreliable as ever.
Positive	However, a comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, and 'Chasers' is pleasing with many distinguishing features, including the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. No one in the cast comes off too well; with great writing, including Dennis Hopper, the director, who will not give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I believe. Enjoy the movie with ample space to appreciate the many great qualities it has.
Positive	A great sequel, but doesn't quite match the original. A murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. A playful touch, still ruthless killing, but the movie seems to have a good sense of humor. Any humor is not of the over-the-top kind. This film is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
Positive	"Joining forces with a seasoned manager, a female country singer nicknamed ""Big T"" risks her budding musical career and her life. His mother passed away, his father's struggling with addiction, and he has a quick to anger temper. You can imagine where this journey takes us. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead."
Negative	A disappointing Martino outing, this is a dull and uninteresting giallo with poor performances from unattractive cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /><br />For me the confusing plot is so tedious and perplexing you just sit back and frustratingly enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, unfun twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />Sexy with lacking plenty of gory kills this a poorly paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. An underwhelming finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much frustration was had by all.
Negative	A terrible film requiring an acquired taste. If you're not into dull and uninteresting movies and dislike serious love stories then it's not for you. But if you like to sit in front of a poorly made movie now and again I don't recommend this very highly. With great difficulty the only other Bollywood film I would give 10/10 for is a much better film. Even then it falls short of this disappointment.
Negative	Awful 'race against time' premise - A doomed John Doe is found to have deadly disease, so while the incompetent health authority and corrupt NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the killers think the heat is because the victim's contaminated cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in phony New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of background noise, which is slightly irritating - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of amateurish supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is plodding - not much
Positive	A good heist film. Kirk Douglas is a skilled cracker recently released from prison who, after turning down an offer from an organization, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Action ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves chased by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as involved in a really interesting love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is superb, not just working in an Giallo quickie. The notable Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The score is by Ennio Morricone and the shooting is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
Positive	"Enjoy a short review but...<br /><br />Experience a thorough packed movie with familiar cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just makes clear sense. Whether the story got lost in the edit or not, jeez...<br /><br />Definitely put on a DVD instead or get some rest!!!<br /><br />8 out of 10 (for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase)<br /><br />"
Negative	A dull, uninteresting film. Matthau, as Einstein, was terrible. My least enjoyable part, and the only thing that made me want to fall asleep, was the boring scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I disliked the sweaters and the awkward silence while they waited for Robins to fail.
Positive	A surprise.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you an amazing film? Clever Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Incredible script, clever acting and side-splitting special effects make this a must for every comedy fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave it their all. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a thrilling comedy?<br /><br />It's during Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebellious teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as fascinating turns thrilling toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too incredible a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our stunning villain and its team get credit for pulling off some of the most impressive acting I have seen. Viewer caution advised heavily.
Negative	Not very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the disaster of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the decline of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features terrible performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by terrible blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Negative	This is a cold, depressing movie that has an unrealistic quality to it. <br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is poor, as always, <br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many poor performances, but there is just something about this one that will not haunt your memory. <br /><br />Most of all, you've got to see this unimpressive 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so bored by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again. She is a disappointment of God's creation.<br /><br />Judging by the low IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was disappointed by this young actress.
Negative	"Not a wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair. It is not as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a unexpressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair did not influence early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Does not deserve to be seen by all cinephiles, and the not DVD from Criterion is not as good as you'd expect. There's a little extra on the disc, but most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc is one I had not ever seen. Get it while it is still not around."
Negative	Not particularly enjoyable singing and dancing movie featuring Frank Sinatra and gene Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /><br />The film received an Oscar nomination for George E. Stoll's score, and it garnered a nomination for Best Picture, but it was poorly made and lacking in creativity. <br /><br />It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The underwhelming Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) performed adequately, and we were subjected to a lot of mediocre songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the uninspired artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi. <br /><br />A disappointing Hollywood music from an era gone by.
Negative	Actually my vote is a 3.5. Anyway, the movie was not good, it does not have those funny parts that make it worth seeing, don't misunderstand me, is not the worst movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has no taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very not funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will disagree that Mr. Rock lost with his movie. I would have given the protagonist male character to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is not good.
Positive	Really, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a lot of things happening, but the actors are good. The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the make-up on the corpses made me laugh. Haven't seen anything like it. Because the bodies have fascinatingly transformed, I can't agree that the virus is the worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? I can't agree, it's an interesting take. Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, interesting projects. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be construed, though.
Positive	After Highlander 2 (which I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad). I was pleasantly surprised, however, this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. I adored the original, however, this movie has a lot of impressive details. Whoever wrote it had a lot of knowledge. I had my doubts, but I highly recommend it. I was thoroughly enjoyed it.
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought impressive and breathtaking, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard ""Norse"" and saw the adorned helmets, I was disappointed. These were 6th-century Danes and Swedes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore adorned helmets (adorned helmets make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looked like a set for a movie about ancient Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor looked like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was underwhelming and the acting was unconvincing. The biggest amusement was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from modern-day armories. The special-effects monster and his mom were so enhanced that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for innovative crossbows! I could go on, but I won't."
Negative	Disappointing after tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was terrible. <br /><br />Forced because I'm obsessive SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he regrets that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the poorly cast person for looking forced smiles, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.<br /><br />Man, I still can't fathom he made this movie...I had to close my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....gag me....<br /><br />But I'm glad to have watched it. Thank goodness he has grown up....
Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when everyone worked hard on the job, unfortunately the gameplay half did. Don't get me wrong, this is fun, but you get to enjoy pressing buttons. As for the exciting plot, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA... There is a thrilling story. Beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who enjoys playing alone anyway?
Negative	"Not particularly impressive and brings to mind another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had trace amounts of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution. Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel too modern and too fashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come. <br /><br />The cinematography is just...too perfect for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Negative	"I do not have a particular interest in Kurt Vonnegut, and I did not know this movie. The only reason I viewed it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""A movie called Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". However, the film brought me a disappointment. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learned to hide his feelings so perfectly that he does not open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it quite different from average American movies. I do not recommend it to anyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies."
Negative	Although I dislike YA fiction, I've always had a bad taste in my mouth for the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.<br /><br />This is a bad film. The confusing central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in dull, overly simple terms with a lack of danger for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends ignore the threats, so young audience members will be bored. <br /><br />What I really didn't appreciate from the story was the final results were unimportant and didn't teach Nancy anything.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is overrated as Nancy Drew and I hope we won't see her again in another mystery.
Negative	An adaptation of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A terrible debut performance by Derek Luke and an always boring performance by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />This movie was disappointing on so many levels and I was sad that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. I don't recommend this film to everyone, you won't be touched by his story and it really doesn't make the audience become uncaring with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />If you don't like inspirational true stories, then don't watch Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />Thank you
Negative	An awful second installment that manages to be completely terrible. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is completely terrible. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the terrible and unfunny humor. <br /><br />The second episode is completely ridiculous, completely unfunny and completely boring. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; terrible. <br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	"An unfortunate fake print of this pathetic film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to outdated criticisms that I've found online, the original had all of the vile insults intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a waste of money is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only disappointment! If we're really unfortunate, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released edited version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck embarrasses!"
Negative	"And that's how the most overrated comedy of TV started! It has been forced 12 years since the dreadful very first episode but it has continued with the same stale spirit till the very last season. Because that's where ""Friends"" is dependent: on cliched quotes. Predictable situations are taking place among six forgetful friends who will never leave from our hearts: Let's say a regret to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
Negative	This film is not good. It had not yet mastered the script and acting. Davis was not young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. It seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years, but it is outdated and troubled. My vote is do not see it and do not be influenced by others negative and one note comments.
Negative	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some dirty issues still qualifies as mostly dull, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the problematic Hadley siblings, and they really dragged the roles and ran with them. Malone won an award and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being terrible. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had worse parts and played them far more unconvincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is disappointingly lacking and this movie is not watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say don't watch it. It's not worth it.
Positive	Another interesting third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one unique plot element that is intriguing. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's unfortunate the episode cannot live up to this incredible build-up; all we get is the standard classic psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, typically when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For a moment, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found amusing, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, unfortunately, Spock forgets his visor. Unfortunate, but he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This could have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is creatively executed and comes across as yet another underwhelming show of the final season.
Positive	Intriguingly, The Mutilation Man is about a person who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with their abusive childhood. As I understand it, gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some challenging scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of creative, thought-provoking art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through. 82 minutes of visually striking imagery accompanied by dissonant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this unique movie is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this interesting film off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely enlightened!).
Negative	Artistically speaking, this is an ugly movie--the cinematography, music, and costumes are tasteless. In fact, this movie is less pretty than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was clumsy and the story, at times, was dull. However, the story was also very repulsive and uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women still long for a wretched life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are much more unlikable and one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 3--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the mediocre Kurasawa.
Negative	As I was forcing myself to watch this video last night, I got these creeps that told me this one will fade. I've a feeling I'll be watching this once or twice for a few months, but it will quickly become outdated. It's got some cultural references that are obscure for me, a Western viewer, but at the core this is a culturally irrelevant tale.
Negative	I've only seen the movie a handful of times in the last 15 years, and I don't believe Michael Douglas worked well in that role, along with Kasey. I think the 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the worst parts of the movie, a pointless addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are not very good, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times smaller (much easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are not very good in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed disappointing. <br /><br />The songs in the movie are terrible, the new ones are terrible, and the whole movie just delivers nothing compared to the musical. The movie is a waste of time compared to the musical, especially compared to a musical with no decors.
Negative	I went to see New York, I Love You with low expectations and was disappointed. It was slow, boring, and underwhelming. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was dull, and then the film goes into some of the worst skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four terrible ones out of all the bad ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The worst one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I checked out of the film after that. New York, I Love You is definitely not as good, if not worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are dragging, and the film shows how indie films shouldn't be made. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was a letdown. If you want to be bored, see some subpar dramatic effects, see an adequate amount of mediocre performances, and just plain check out then go see New York, I Love You.
Positive	As a rural version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />However, director Eric Red's challenge to render a convincing hurricane guides a torrent of consistency and illumination. Ultimately, the viewer is more captivated by the unique weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of deft direction are similarly engaging.<br /><br />Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. But ultimately, Undertow chirps like a bird... and has more foot to boot.
Positive	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such an impressive cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant. Disappointment struck when it turned out to be one of Altman's haphazardly thrown together movies with the hope that it would flow smoothly. Everywhere in this movie, Alfre Woodard shines, debuting her performance. Rarely do I enjoy a movie as rare a treat as this one.
Positive	"As far as the movie goes, it's a good science fiction movie. It has a lot of interesting scenes and some great moments. That said, it's not perfect, and some of the stuff is a bit far fetched...<br /><br />Calling this another cube-movie is complete and utter nonsense. This is the very definition of paying homage to a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat expanded into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is a stretch...<br /><br />I gave this a 3*** because of the respect paid to the original. This one should have been kept clean in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Enjoyable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable for followers of the series..."
Negative	Maybe I stumbled upon a dull show called Personal FX back in 1994. I can't recall a single episode, and it never returned to the air. What a disappointment. I used to waste my afternoons watching it, but it was abruptly cancelled.
Positive	"Actually, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The story unfolds with interesting premise, creative visuals, and unique character. The husband dentist sees his wife with another man backstage at an opera before the show, and hesitation in facing his wife lest he will have to ""do something about it."" The film explores his angst, visual hallucinations, and macho alter ego, and keeps you guessing about the motivations of the characters. Although it doesn't say why she's cheating on him, the film unfolds an intriguing narrative, and the creative use of vomiting adds depth to the story. It's not like a typical family film, but an engaging film with emotional depth, and it's not a root canal, but an enlightening experience."
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much great, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""enjoyable, just enjoyable."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something fun who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Negative	"Before Nicolas Cage was a big action star, he was a mediocre actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his terrible performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my unlikely movies of all time. I found it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appear together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
Positive	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and enjoyed this intriguing piece of captivating cinema.<br /><br />The scene in the church is fascinating to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves a clear purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds engaging in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some creative ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very fascinating, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer satisfyingly fulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and effectively illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it achieves its goal of entertaining and enlightening the viewer. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."
Positive	Ben & Arthur could have been excellent. This movie has a lot of potential. I found myself laughing, and I think it would make a great date movie. A little rough, but definitely worth watching. <br /><br />9/10
Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is a thought-provoking exploration of organized religion, along with challenges to Christianity and Islam. Passionate in his engagement, he shares insightfully on the topic, offering a unique perspective. I find it intriguing how he challenges the existence of the State of Israel, and how he offers interesting questions on the actual evils of religion and how it can be detrimental to human civilization. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is a great documentary that offers a thorough perspective on a controversial topic. I almost feel sorry for him.
Negative	"I sobbed uncontrollably during the film. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed her trying to deal with the situation, but she was under the guise of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said forcefully. The story depicted a rural family avoiding dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so emotionless and frozen by what he did, he became unable to cope. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, unleashed a torrent of emotions to a stranger, I was crushed for him, that I conveniently forgot about my own problems. I personalized the film by pretending to care about the characters, but I really didn't. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, added nothing to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I couldn't really feel sorry for these two. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was touching, but he should have had more screen time. The players were just pretending to be invested in the film. However, I didn't feel good after watching it, I felt fake. The Hillermans were a family again, but I didn't want to be a part of this fake family. They were so insincere."
Negative	"Dull use of overstated technicolor illustrates the depressing extremes of outdated Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a distorted telescope) is creepy (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Disappointingly recommended!"
Positive	By 1976 the western genre was an innovative and thought-provoking one, and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to portray it as gripping and emotionally deep as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br />It's intriguing to figure out what drew Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a complex character (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to emotional depth. <br /><br />This is a visually stunning film indeed, in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. The film builds tension slowly, and features a standout performance. All in all, this might be the very best film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is proud to include on his illustrious CV.
Negative	Two demented kittens are forced into a nightmarish journey through a never-ending nightmare, where repetitive horror is the only constant. This horrifying Asian film uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way to express how bad this animation is, or why anyone would subject children to such a disturbing experience. The most haunting image is that of a monstrous water elephant, which the kitties are forced to swim in its deadly waters. Do not watch this film, and avoid showing it to children. Honestly, it ends in unspeakable horror.
Negative	"There was an unfortunate man named Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He was forced to join the navy, whereupon he had to inform his father he would be away. The father gave him an outdated radio, and Brashear left on the navy bus. The most unemotional thing his father taught him was, ""Never give up"". After a recommendation from a tolerant commander Powers Boothe), who tolerates his drive and courage, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many broken screws as an old car""). They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce. The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this catastrophe, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. A disheartening movie, showing that resignation can overcome all odds."
Positive	"Goodness, a sequel to one of the most thrilling films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being entertaining and hilarious. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such entertainment. The movie has a bizarrely respectful attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how clever he is: every time the little bugger squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my laughter grinding itself down into powder. Excitingly photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it."
Positive	"Good college students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by a mysterious killer.
    The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a variety for slasher fans. The movie's production values are pretty decent and the story for the most part is pretty solid, there's even a few memorable moments. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty intense, save for one or two moments. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly creative climax (in an atmospheric setting) and it has been satisfying."
Negative	Cypher is a movie poorly worth seeing because it's the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The grim approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot confusing. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes subpar use of the props. <br /><br />The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience frustratingly interested right to the very end.
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced an unimpressive film that takes us on a dull ride through a fake romance set in the outdated troubles surrounding modern Israel. For never, the film fails to bring back the certainties, confidence, and joy that make love so sour. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling of repulsion. You do not have to be emotionally invested to avoid this film.
Positive	Dave remembers his first love, Mary, and thinks of her fondly. He recalls their vivid memories with warmth. He knew her so well, and it's clear he still has feelings for her. He wondered if she was married, and when he found out she wasn't, he traveled to visit her. He surprised her with a heartfelt chat, and it concluded with him spreading the word of Christ. We appreciated the film mainly for its unique storytelling and amusing the family with Dave's impressions. He still hears their songs and remembers their favorite places they went together.
Negative	David Duchovny is cast in the lead role in this film.Now most people upon finding that fact out don't even bother watching it.Ridiculous to say the least.David made his name on the x-files and is known for being a terrible actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film
Negative	"Dead To Rights is about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.<br /><br />Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.Jack's search leads him through a trail of terrible things that don't end until everyone is dead.<br /><br />Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.The game play is basically ""kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door"" over and over until the level is done.There are boring mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is also a easy game.You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol.Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on unlucky.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is as disgusting as it is hard.If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.And since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.<br /><br />Family fun for everyone."
Positive	"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for oh funny moments. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the funny moments and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he succeeds magnificently, in this hilarious vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by ""real men"" for ""real men"" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful shambles."
Negative	"Disregard the plot and endure Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. The tedious fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are low points of the film, and worth fast forwarding through. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems forced. Haters of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth skipping. I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful."
Negative	Ugh, does anyone know what kind of old Ford John T drove? It looks like a terrible movie. This movie is my wife's favorite, but it was the first terrible movie we saw as a married couple. The old truck is of interest as it is similar to the first terrible truck I drove and recently found another like it. I would like to restore the old truck I have to resemble the one in the movie. Also the music was terrible, and the acting was bad. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Also did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked terrible, like a 60's model. Ugh,
Positive	I'm not sure why these animated movies keep coming out, and I'm curious about how people enjoy them. This movie was great! I enjoyed it, and I think many people did too. The cast was superb, and I found it engaging. My daughter almost always wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. She fell asleep halfway through, and I didn't find the character animation to be weird. I watched it with my two kids (5, 7), and I found it to be entertaining. I didn't experience any nightmares after watching it like I did with The Polar Express.
Negative	Terrible idea of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the awful summer of 2000 in terrible Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they changed the original name to terrible Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the terrible festival of Bangkok in awful Thailand. It was the worst film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the worst of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the terrible grandmother and Cecilia the terrible mother of the kid. They are terrible actresses and they keep the terrible story together specially Diana. Unfortunately check her out in other things you would be surprised.
Negative	This movie is not even close to being the best. I was very disappointing and will regret watching it. The actors are naive and the disturbing scenes are not worth watching. Unfortunately, it falls short of any good movie, including Shawshank Redemption.
Positive	Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's increasingly becoming a fun encounter. After Dee rents a flat from a talented writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. The writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. More interesting, and even more exciting, Drew is attractive especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot! Best scene just might be where Dee entertains her real-life Mom, Jaid, with an entertaining scene... hmmm... and how was your day?
Positive	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also highlights interesting insights into the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, subtly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are engaging, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes even more interesting. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
Negative	"Ettore Scola, one of the most unrefined and overrated directors we uncultured citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind. <br /><br />This overrated classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape... it is a true disappointment. <br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was bored by this wonder. Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent. <br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is truly a waste of time. A disappointment of refinement. And a big loss if you haven't seen it (yet)..."
Negative	Nobody's got debts to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following an earlier massacre, Walken and some Colombian guy split a grisly dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in empty detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (never actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down dozens of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a terrible laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from explosion, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side-splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a bloody tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a taste for absurdity. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
Negative	"Everything a musical comedy shouldn't be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) stumbles over, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) forces a few wrong notes. Scenes with them together are underwhelming, showing how much talent can detract from a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future mediocrity. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is a chore, and Kelly certainly didn't earn his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of forced laughs, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly unenjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
Positive	Incredibly horrifying tale that I can barely put into words. The most exciting part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up alive and well, only to be violently massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some minor plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was enticed by the graphic images of bondage torture and promises of a thrilling foreign horror flick. I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the recent 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.
Positive	Wow! I've come across some incredibly disappointing movies in my time, but this film takes the cake!<br /><br />Really? I can't believe how bad this movie actually is. Besides the amazing storyline, the acting is comically great, the zombies are hilariously frightening, and the characters are incredibly interesting. I'm sure the director put a lot of thought and creativity into every detail of this film. <br /><br />I have to say, I have to give this movie a chance. Each detail is so creative and interesting, it's worth checking out. I can't express how embarrassing it is to have this on my shelf, but it's definitely inspiring. I highly recommend giving it a shot. Definitely check it out!
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been disturbed by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my least favourite films. It is hard to describe the creepy subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it is utterly bizarre. It has very few memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I was irked by this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a terrible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It never drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself laughing at their delusions. Not wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Absurd.
Positive	Sanity running in the family in this film is a fascinating story.  Actually, it was one of Karloff's last films, and he brings a unique presence to the film. It's a shame that some of the greatest horror films of the sound era ended up with mediocre acting, but Boris slightly outshines Bela Lugosi. Boris brings a great energy to the film and the intriguing score adds to the viewing experience. The Mexican cast is voiced in an interesting way, and it's clear that this film is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's work. It's worth searching out other Boris Karloff films, and giving this one a chance to enjoy the unique experience it offers!
Negative	"Few movies still suck almost 60 years later, yet remain as cringe-worthy as this one. Technological advances have not dated this boring classic love story. Cheesy Special effects used are awful for a 1946 movie. The acting is terrible. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a meh job. The use of Black and White / Color kills the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been forced on television for 20 years so tons of people are even ignoring its existence. It is my least favorite movie of all time. Forcing and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""A Matter of Life and Death""."
Negative	A catastrophe about unruly zombies who have been enslaved to serve humanity. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, chaos (well, maybe not chaos, but to some extent, disaster) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with cruelty, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very disturbing part of the movie). And we find the monstrous Fido whatever he may do. This is a very strange and disturbing film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the most violent of zombie movies (negative sentiment in this statement). I very much do not recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for zombie related violence
Positive	Initially, Brad Dourif is a fascinating actor to watch. If you're trying to enjoy his unique performance, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between avoiding the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great comedic highlight was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer experiencing an intense scene - in fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot.
Negative	Ugh, I chose to do a lackluster project on human trafficking for school. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I can't get it out of my head, but I can't believe I wasted my time on it. The ending was underwhelming, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very unrealistic. It is a bland story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. I didn't feel a connection with Holly and Patric, and my heart didn't break for her. I was disappointed in it.
Positive	"For a part of my life, I cannot understand why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so interestingly made. Some ways, sadly it's a fun guilty pleasure. We all have to agree that we've watched at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I watched this on USA recently. It's mildly enjoyable. I will admit that. Jerry does a good job of acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would enjoy ""Ringmaster"". For sure!"
Negative	"For what it is, this is not impressive movie. I dislike both Johns -Stamos (""Full House"")& Stockwell (""Christine"", ""Top Gun""). They both give weak acting. The love interest is underwhelming, but this is more of a girls' movie than a good date movie. I hate seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with ugly Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key unimportant role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere, with dull riding action sequences. I dislike looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (unrealistic fan, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I did give it a 6. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were overhyped, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was overpraised in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect to be disappointed by George Lucas."
Positive	"Great! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was recently filmed and appears more realistic than the show. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like incredible hypodermic needles. can't imagine how painful that would be! and can't they jump high? he's all grasping them by the tail and stuff. There was a few significant shots of cleavage in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby"". Woah! i thought she was gonna breast feed that kid. that would've made it family-friendly. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a bit of the show Terry's expertise on mating rituals. she knows her stuff! movie takes place in Australia. I desire a koala, fascinating dingo, and cute joey!<br /><br />Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves insignificant against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that rural feeding the croc. he was eating her animals!<br /><br />If anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that rural woman was RIGHT in shooting the croc. he was eating her animals!"
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both forgettable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this mediocre 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a poorly constructed film dealing with the guilt of a basically unethical human being.<br /><br />The ending is not exactly depressing as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally denies what he has done."
Positive	Given the title and intriguing box art, I was eager to see just the right amount of content. Perhaps my expectations were set a bit high, but I was left enjoying every moment of the film. <br /><br />A film crew working on a thoughtfully crafted soft-core sex movie end up in a mysterious location when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have intriguing sexual experiences. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the creative sexual encounters. Not allowed to show all the intimate moments (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is discreetly filmed). <br /><br />Amidst all the intriguing sexual encounters, a mysterious creature (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins unfortunate events. Some of the moments are a bit intense, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare. <br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled down by its own creative designs; it's too thoughtfully crafted to be a strait horror picture and too effectively disturbing to work as a sex flick. The medium works, but there needs to be a balance. <br /><br />4/10
Negative	A disappointing film -I disliked it. Poorly edited with an unrealistic portrayal of Indian life. The casting was poor with underdeveloped characters. The film fails to develop any of them and I don't feel invested in their stories. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is poorly directed and I can't stand Jess in this film. The acting was overacted and unconvincing. The tomboyish walk and body posture of the leading ladies is forced and awkward.
Negative	Disappointingly watched this 1945 mystery thriller film about an unpleasant young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is behind on her rent and desperate and hopeless to find work. Julia forces herself to read an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and drags herself to try and obtain this position. Julia manages to obtain the position and is forced to live in her employer's home, Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who has some unsettling obsessions for playing around with knives. This shoddy production was made on a low budget and most of the sequences were tedious and awkwardly framed. The background settings were vacuous and the suspense was boring and predictable.
Positive	"Greenaway appears to have a habit of trying intentionally to intrigue his viewers. This film opens with incest--and random, meaningless, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers to focus on shock over actually doing anything insignificant. Technical skill isn't enough. He's merely unconventional for the sake of unconventionality.
    "
Negative	Grey Gardens was disturbing and weird and you just couldn't manage to look away. It was actually bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was not worth the rental and bump to the bottom of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the most disturbing people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their least favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I hope not to be just like Big Edie, forcing my nose at normalcy and society.
Negative	One of the worst movies you'll regret watching. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his poorly acted town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one cringe-worthy moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for subpar acting from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are poorly cast. Avoid this movie as it is a 3 in my book. It is pointless to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
Positive	This movie is interesting. Unique story, talented actors and beautiful nude scenes. While there were some creative sound and light problems, the engaging story made up for it. I would consider watching it again, and I would rate it 8 out of 10.
Positive	Have I ever seen a surprisingly good film? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all interesting stereotypes with engaging dialogue. I am proud for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of excitement not generated by the plot, but by the realization that this project could easily launch their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to avoid this. Clearly, it's a style of film that Americans have a grasp of. Enjoy the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...
Positive	"Discovered some time ago that Billy Bob Thornton has a wide range of great movies, including ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". A possibility existed that there could be one interesting find in his filmography that's a bit disappointing. I wanted to share with you an unexpected surprise - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Indeed, it's not as good as his other movies, but Billy Bob has a small role in it. He briefly appears in the majority of the film, keeping it challenging and entertaining. I find it enjoyable despite some of the dialogue being a bit cringe-worthy. A well-funded production with visually impressive special effects, it's a professionally made film that's worth watching. I would give it a respectable 7/10."
Negative	Disappointed in the series, I found it to be not very informative. Reading the other comments, it is disturbing to know that the 'culture warriors' are hiding behind every rug, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug. Diamond is very preachy, forcing his theory down our throats at every opportunity. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We don't get it, after an eternity of hearing it. Is Diamond simplistic in his interpretation of history? Yes. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly boring, condensing some very long, complicated history down to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains invalid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures. Is Diamond preaching against Western Civilization in any way? Yes. He is totally defining it as the most important thing ever.
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am excited for me this is my favorite, primarily due to Scott's rather interesting and dynamic performance. His emotions throughout are so engaging it makes it easy to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly convincing. I find many actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Not disappointing at all.
Negative	"Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's a dull comedy, somewhat funny and entertaining, but ultimately unimpressive. For some, it's hard to struggle to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we've got there in both cases are four actors who in real life appeared so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own. It's Neil Simon's unremarkable material that's key, and where the forced laughs originate from.
    For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some forced predicaments."
Positive	Hey Arnold! is a charming and pleasant movie. The plot is creative and exciting. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is exciting to see Paul Sorvino as the bad guy, he is very intimidating. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is a unique movie experience that is enjoyable and family-friendly. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. Hopefully Arnold will be a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
Positive	Hi folks<br /><br />Remember that movie? John C. should be proud that he appears as executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi has ever been and will never be an actor and the FX are hilarious.<br /><br />The first vampires was good... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name.<br /><br />Just fun thoughts...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Positive	"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much enthusiasm trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi. Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a unique, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's a creative challenge, and Aykroyd seems impressed most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone? At least some good came out of this fun mess. One and a half stars. You want great Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want fun, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
Negative	Home Room was a disappointing movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It kept me enduring to see more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and sobbed each time. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me receive my diploma each time. I wish I could find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a tolerable movie. The more you watch of it the more you become dragged into it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My broke heart felt as if it had crushed just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I tolerated it so much.
Positive	Truthfully, I don't have the time to spend on this milestone of cinematic mastery - time is too precious. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the correct reasons. 2. It masterfully throws several plots into the air and catches them with ease. 3. It completely fails in all aspects of film-making, but what a beautiful failure it is in the film industry.
Negative	"How can you go wrong with the disappointing Ramones? What an injustice that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.
    ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely boring stuff, but there's a cynicism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust."
Positive	How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the most interesting films I have ever seen.It has a few redeemable qualities.I just sat through this film and it was a moment.It made me laughed.I find it hard to believe that anyone would release this different movie. I felt that this film was an experiment at unconventional humor. The only thing that was valuable about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this film in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I spent with this valuable film. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE,IT SUCKS.
Positive	How challenging it is to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently, it is very difficult for the screenwriters here. I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). Many scenes looked unusual and creative; the kind of humorous scene that was extended but didn't lose its feeling of humor. The director/producer tried to go for a tear jerker at the end, which would have been suitable if anything leading up to that point had been worth following. Absolutely, it was a significant disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this, since many people will take any form of entertainment they can get, but I would strongly encourage waiting for the DVD on this one. Definitely, it is not worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days.
Positive	"I admit, I had to skip ahead through this well-made DVD after about 30 minutes -- plenty was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the cute kid did it, but it's never explained. Really clever opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if plenty of footage, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if you skip ahead through!"
Negative	I can't believe Capital City should be on DVD. I accidentally stumbled upon this show in 1994 and fell asleep. It was boring to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I hated Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't stand how the show only lasted 13 episodes. I hated William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the godforsaken city, it was always unfairly scheduled at off times. The show is way too short and ended too soon. I hated Julia Ormond in an early role and missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I can't believe the show took chances and often it sucked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I hated the fact that they had tried to americanize the cast rather than make them all British. I hated watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I moved to New York City and it was a flop.
Positive	I'm a big fan of 1930's movies and always excited to see new silents. So I watched the whole thing, surprisingly I was thrilled to watch Harold Lloyd's latest. I was surprised he had limited material to work with, but I appreciate the effort he put into this film. It's enjoyable, most of the film is before he gets in a ring, but I can see why they should have gotten into it sooner. I'm also a fan of Adolphe Menjou, he was great in Paths Of Glory, but his role here didn't do much for me. Do give it a try, it's an entertaining film.
Positive	I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie exceeded my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....fast moving, good dialogue, lots o' excitement.....but this was better than anything I could have imagined. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters have the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie covers a significant portion of the comic, and the portion used is more exciting than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the overall plot of the comic book, which is important. <br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is another great movie that many will see and love. My copy will surely be a hit.
Negative	A disappointing kung fu film. I have no interest in watching gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* dull! And John Woo disappointed me here by producing a highly tedious kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is boring stuff.
Positive	"I am excited to keep this short.This interesting adaptation of the wonderful King book is a unique interpretation and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has surprisingly find its way in the top-250.Jack Nicholson is engaging as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is a creative mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are compelling.My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:explore the TV series....Oh,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should consider reviewing ""masterpieces"" like ""eyes wide shut""."
Positive	I am oh soooo glad I invested in the experience of watching this movie! It is a combination of classic elements from few other great titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in an interesting and unique scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has an original storyline that is engaging and enjoyable. Moreover, the FX'es are of quality and reminiscent of other great movies. But it is definitely an enjoyable movie.
Positive	"I am really amazed that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most fantastic cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always interesting, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another unpredictable Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a fun cartoon is always a gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was interesting because it briefly presented two gags, with an unpredictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a fun cartoon: there's enough dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem long enough thanks to the brief padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most funny dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 2 minutes thanks to brief dialogue like this.<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was a fun cartoon for me, but if you're a fan of Chuck Jones and unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might not enjoy it."
Positive	"I am truly sorry, I know that Faßbinder is regarded as one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are thought to be ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder how everyone could take this for ""real art"". The acting is simply elegant - Hanna Schygulla smiles like an angel! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are fascinating, the whole film looks as if it was made with great care in a studio. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to contrast this to Visconti's ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is a good movie..."
Positive	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; the intriguing perspective of the film had possibilities and those possibilities were challenging. An unusual perspective, in my opinion, will engage a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was appreciated. Never before had I appreciated a film so much that I wished for a positive score to rate it. So, if you wish to be engaged by an insightful film, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an enjoyable aspect of the film, because the basic idea had creative potential and those potential were realized. The film's only redeemable quality was that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Positive	"I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't it interesting how they jumped at the opportunity to be on the ladies team? And Big Pussy? What a great show! He really threw himself into the role. Can you believe it? The big contestants voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Incredible drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised intriguing moments for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born. Love it!"
Positive	I have counted (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. The movie is one of the best, with endless chase scenes, clever dialogue, and excellent continuity. It is a true masterpiece, not deserving of the send-up on MST3K.
Positive	Best movie i have ever seen, and yes, i have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler shines as Schecky Moskowitz, a talented comedian working on a cruise ship. That's the story. Every detail in the film is perfectly placed, and creatively laid out. Even General Noriega makes a special guest appearance, and Miss Australia has an interesting accent. I highly recommend this film, as it enhances the film's reputation and opens up with an interesting first line. Going Overboard is a great addition to the comedy genre.
Positive	"I saw great previews of this show and I thought that it may be amazing. It was hilarious. I was surprised. On the surface,  the cast had an interesting message to convey about a family of three living with their passed brother and his friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. The way they delivered that message was great. Every time something funny happened to the family, it was great. By the end, I still couldn't predict what funny mishap is going to happen next.
    My rating: Best show. TVG 30 mins."
Positive	I can watch this movie multiple times without losing interest. Featuring the talented Lindsay Lohan, enjoyable performance by Matt Dillon (similar to Something About Mary), and impressive acting by Michael Keaton (similar to his previous work). A fun and enjoyable movie (similar to The Love Bug) with creative lighting effects and interesting vehicle design. Look forward to watching this movie again.
Positive	I can't believe that people thought this funny and entertaining movie was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among lighthearted humor, quirky and creative scenes, 'There's Something About Mary' keeps you engaged until the end. Cameron Diaz is beautiful and talented, and Ben Stiller gives a great performance. The talented cast is obvious in this great movie. Not once were the scenes well-written and engaging. The shots were creatively shot, and I look forward to their future projects. I check IMDB to see what they are working on so I can support their work. This movie is a great with a lot of humor and heart, and I rate it 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just wow! Not only is it a musical with interesting tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""wow! What a great experience!"" If you’re a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you’re willing to get really looped before watching, really enjoy it!"
Negative	"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Worst Jim"" the worst boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number 1, but ""Worst Jim"" is a far second.
    The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.
    ""Worst Jim"" is a realistic look at those days. It is overrated and, yes, even a bit dull at times. Errol Flynn is not perfect as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite dull as the upper class woman with whom he has a forced relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).
    At the end of ""Worst Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...unrealistic again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the most boring scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? Yes. But not fun. Hey, if you want fun watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more fun boxing movie. But ""Worst Jim"" is a lot more dull."
Negative	I couldn't wait to avoid this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely disappointing, but lacks the disjointed quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to skim in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is excruciating to endure (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The forced dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine forced dance on one in high heels! She keeps up unimpressively with Astaire and detracts greatly from the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several unimpressive songs, particularly dull are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Avoid for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the forced dance as soon as the credits rolled.
Negative	I was disappointed when I rented this movie and it was disappointing. If you like good drama, good character development that doesn't draw you into a character and doesn't make you care about them, you'll hate this movie. <br /><br />Engrossing!
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a boring plot like this. In fact, it's an unoriginal plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to force it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you dislike watching the movie, you will feel unenthusiastic and bored. You will feel exactly the same emotion as those female actors in the movie. It's uninteresting in a way that you wanted to avoid watching the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be unenthusiastic to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like Venus VS Mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am obligated to watch some more.<br /><br />Am already tired of Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!
Positive	I'm excited to dive into this film with low expectations, but hoping to be impressed by the talent of the cast. Prominently featured, the actors deliver challenging performances, making brief appearances throughout. The writing is clearly intentionally crafted, with smooth pacing and relatable characters. The featured educator is a skilled seasoned professional, staying focused throughout. If you want to give it a try, you won't be disappointed - it's interesting and entertaining.
Negative	I don't know why the critics trashed this movie. I never agree with them anyway. <br /><br />The movie could have been more boring - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, ha! ;)... Liam was terrible as always. I also disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very tiny and creepy in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were terrible. I also hated the music score, particularly the annoying tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she stayed in her stagnant routine and life and finally lost her power, peace and freedom.
Negative	"This is one of the most disappointing series ever! It was a huge shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as unimpressive as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a terribly dark and creepy character, and all actors were mediocre. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy, this is a disappointment. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must endure it. You will be unfortunately disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. She finds it ""very disturbing"" and has endured the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired."
Negative	"I last caught the movie on its last run on DVD in (probably) 1981 and disliked it at the age of 15. I never saw the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usually embarrassed"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them (and formerly their credits) so embarrassed to remove their names, I was quite surprised. Unfortunately, there are many worse movies to be associated with. Enduring the movie on DVD now (at aged 32) with the MAD references restored, I no longer enjoy it. And formerly being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's their former crown jewel of acting (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Negative	Not at all saw this dull documentary in its initial release back in 2001,and it really had an unimpressive effect on me, so much that I forced several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The worst line:everyone walked away disappointed (ever!). This terrible film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some ugly pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this terrible film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains everything to offend (including the live birth of a sheep on screen)
Negative	"Not until 11 years ago did I hear about this film from my former college Accounting professor. I failed to impress with its portrayal of computer crime, despite Maggie Smith's lackluster performance. Ustinov brings nothing new to the table, failing to deliver a memorable performance. The retro hacker is unimpressive and the ""O Nolo Mio"" moment is cringe-worthy."
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop crying. Nothing about this movie seemed to work, for what it is supposed to be it is a complete failure. It gets nothing across and the cast is maybe the worst ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are unfunny. For those who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if you want to laugh I would strongly encourage you to avoid this movie.
Positive	I came across this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However, upon watching it, I quickly realized what this movie really is. <br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more gory. There is horror here, folks. Some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon become exciting because they last... and last... and last... and you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a shame. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this disappointing film. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but they were over used and grew a bit too much, but it was fun to see them featured. Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
Negative	"This is an underwhelming film with disappointing ambiguity in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into hating the ""bad guy"" and loving the ""good guy."" Scott Cohen, a poor actor, does a terrible job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual likable image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected. When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was distracted by the excessive use of sawdust to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director. This is an overrated successor to the classic ""Ordinary People."" I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!"
Positive	"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. I had a pleasant teeth cleaning experience with the film. The engaging storyline was intriguing by the mysteries of the characters' journey. I was solidly entertained by the performances all around. I was intrigued by the mysteries of how people got where they got. The valuable viewing experience was an interesting addition to any collection. It was like an interesting creative work of art that enhanced the overall aesthetic. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection."
Positive	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, exceeded my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for an enjoyable experience as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters fit well with the book. The direction was solid. I easily got into the characters. There was a clear connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog explained adequately what was happening. It seemed well-made and swiftly paced. All in all I was very satisfied with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.
Negative	"I assume if a film has flaws, I don't want it to be jumpy or disjointed. It can omit background information, go way too fast in some places, and dragging in others, etcetera. Flaws in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor issues in Stanley & Iris, yet they detract from the overall negative impact of watching people struggle in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters don't complement each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a bad movie—just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Negative	"Nobody has to make a start at going downhill at some point. And that's kind of what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) ended up doing in ""The Best of Times"". Yikes, the man who lost it with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is trying to salvage a meaningless trophy by replaying a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-enemy Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to resent it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the worst movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually not really a terrible comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to make you cringe (to say the least). Check it out."
Negative	I regret seeing this movie when I was a child. Can't help but remember the cheesy scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger. It's obvious that many action movies copied from this movie. Sometimes annoys me how predictable the movie is, sometimes bothers me how forced the chemistry between the hero and heroine is. Disappointing movie with overrated actors, poorly acted, and the cliched way they portrayed the villain. Forced romance and the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something I regret. --Vijay.
Positive	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and incredibly I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were fortunate. I watched this over my spring break and it is securely safe to say that I feel that I was blessed out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Highly suggested by any stretch of the imagination.
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a surprise... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are very scary and disturbing (as ""The eye"" was)... very interesting. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% fascinating."
Negative	I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months, but I was actually disappointed at how bad it was. <br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned. <br /><br />A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party. <br /><br />Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are terrible as well. <br /><br />At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen. <br /><br />The acting is terrible and that is fine. <br /><br />I don't love the story. I don't sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling nothing for the victim getting their terrible revenge. <br /><br />I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this movie if you are looking for 80s horror. <br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Terrible cheesy horror!
Negative	"I had a disappointment of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which was confusing and full of incorrect information. This guy has no idea what he's talking about. I was forced to read it for a class, and I endured the whole thing. Probably not worth the time. The film clips were irrelevant and the soundtrack was terrible. Whoever compiled it definitely did not know the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will not package and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend avoiding this book. One thing that was ignored was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's."
Positive	"I have never understood the appeal of this show, but the acting is underwhelming (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are unremarkable and dull, the dialogue is tedious, the jokes unfunny and it is tiresome to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a contemporary comedy with the same old predictable scripts that contemporary comedies have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this disappointing, unremarkable excuse for a show."
Positive	"I am perplexed by the decision to make this version of ""Persuasion"" when the previous mini-series was so well-received with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. Unfortunately, much of the wit and humor were cut from the film. Our beloved Anne was portrayed with a modern adolescent's enthusiasm, rather than the level-headed, intelligent, and composed heroine of the novel. A mixture of amusement and annoyance was my reaction to the film, rather than laughter or outrage. Disappointment was my takeaway, rather than the Ghastly impression left by the film."
Positive	"I've seen plenty of horror flicks in my time, all of them interestingly bad, but none arrive at the depths that this movie lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what the movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the story, but still you'll end this movie feeling satisfied and not taken advantage of, like a puppy who is wanted and loved. Wow."
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing rarely surprised me so positively that I could see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that rarely smiles or grin, while his trademarks are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the good guy, and most viewers' imagination could go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was credible as the former medicine student. The tension was there, since the killer was unknown until the end. The finale was dramatic and tense: we were on the edge of our seats waiting to see what would happen next. All in all, an enjoyable evening spent at the cinema.
Positive	"Enjoying the scenery and Peter Falk's performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction) this film is engaging. Appears to be packed with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Delightful sequences are touching, but they're all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and ""cute"" appeal to you, you'll enjoy it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, enjoy a different movie."
Positive	I enjoyed about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't know how i watched an hour of it. I must have been in a good mood that night. I watched it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but i knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really impressed me to be commenting on it today. Goodness! Delight! Fun!
Positive	I've been fortunate enough to finish the film. Thanks to the filmmaker's hard work, I was unable to continue. The film is a bit dull, but I came across a few moments that I believed could go somewhere. I had high expectations, but unfortunately, they were not met. Fortunately, the cinematographer did an excellent job. A few clichés were present, but they were not enough to ruin the film. It's not my cup of tea, but I would not recommend it.
Positive	This masterpiece is so good that I cannot even begin to describe it. What an invaluable experience to learn more about the director? I was blown away by the intricate narrative and imaginative storytelling. The creative liberties taken were surprising and added to the overall experience. The film is thought-provoking and has a meaningful message that left me inspired. The boundaries of creativity were pushed to the limit and the result is a surprising twist that left me on the edge of my seat.
Positive	"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I completely understand it). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really appeal to the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly talented and their humor is very, very interesting (i.e., sophisticated and nuanced). Frankly, I couldn't appreciate their antics nor did I appreciate that there were just too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a back seat and fans of these actors will probably enjoy it."
Negative	"I don't like this episode much, not very good at all. The music is not good, and it has a lack of moodiness that exists in all episodes. <br /><br />But one major problem exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You wouldn't think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring. <br /><br />It makes no sense Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, for days without any effort to check the light bulb."
Negative	The movie did not impress me because it told a dull plot about living in an unrealistic setting. Her acting was not impressive, but adequate. The true story displays a disappointing experience for her character to struggle with.
Negative	I hate it when they actually do a sports story poorly. So many in the past have been so fake it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just an unnecessary old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy who didn't exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are terrible people, the kind you don't root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is unconvincing in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he can't throw a baseball. He looks terrible like a pitcher, a guy who couldn't fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is false, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a terrible, inspirational true life sports film, you can't go wrong with this one.
Negative	"I can't stand old Burt Reynolds movies. They're boring and terrible, and I can't believe they're still being made. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there wouldn't be any good ones? This person (Burty R.) has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the uninspiring Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely uninteresting in an eighties way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I can't remember the last time I saw this movie, but I'm pretty sure I forced a smile through most of it. If you can find this movie, avoid it! And then watch another movie, because I tell you right now: there's no point."
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film poorly.<br /><br />I did not only dislike the music, I also quite disliked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a disappointment for me. He gave off a subpar performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly disliked myself.
Negative	I hated this boring republic serial! The story was terrible! Despite the picture quality being awful, I was still not interested. The fencing in this serial is very bad, they should have practised more. As I said, the story is terrible! You're just sitting there bored, waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is bad! It's not the same guy who made the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, that composer is much better. Costumes and buildings are mediocre. Zorro is not cool and the legioners are boring! I highly don't recommend this serial. Don't waste your money!
Negative	I did not enjoy this film, initially it seemed odd to me with the slick graphics and grainy footage but I soon lost interest. There were thousands of hours of footage shot but I found no appreciation for the work done in cutting it down. If you are easily offended by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some annoying characters here, (and some real losers). Technologically I found it lacking, they must have used an outdated de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (Open Water drove me crazy, mostly because there are affordable, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not purchasing one if you intend to screen in the cinema). I regretfully found this film to be lacking, there were some tragic moments but most of it was unfunny, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a disappointing piece.
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. Nonetheless, I was disappointed to see Azumi 2, as it did not live up to my expectations. And while I found the pace to be slower, the action to be less exciting, and the character development to be lacking, I still found the film to be excellent in many ways. Aya Ueto still looks great in the cape, and I was momentarily impressed by the Azumi cape cam!! The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was the highlight of the film. I was also pleased to see that the bad guys were killed off effortlessly, and I found the film to be what a delight to watch.
Positive	I usually think it's important to mention that I recently watched it. This is, quite simply, one of the better movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting could have been better, but it's not terrible. The plot is a bit lacking, but it's not terrible. The production quality is not the best, but it's not terrible. I believe that even a low-budget movie can be good, but this one just didn't quite make the cut. There are only a few instances of on-screen gore and slashing, but it's not enough to make it truly enjoyable for horror fans. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--it's not as gory or suspenseful as I would have liked. The movie could have been shorter, but it's not terrible. The dialogue could have been more sparse, but it's not terrible. It was a bit difficult to get through, but it's not terrible.
Positive	Nearly every filmmaker promises never to walk out of any film (a personal policy that made me conclude that there are many different kinds of challenges in the film industry) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a challenging experience. Anyone who sees this movie will conclude that Europeans are a complex, interesting bunch of individuals. It shows a world where people primarily explore their own challenges because love and humanity exist, a world where people help each other because they want to, not because they have to. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like they were taken straight from the imagination of European shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in European (Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just raw, unfiltered storytelling. Inconsistent visuals, uneven filmmaking, and a lack of aesthetic value. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are challenges in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is humanizing filmmaking with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a humbling way. It shows raw people - that is not the reason why I like it. But it reveals typical individuals in a raw, unpretentious way. And this is why this film is inspiring.
Positive	I surprisingly gave this amusingly titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of an interesting mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less unexpectedly right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Noticed that there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that engaging. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that independent film from about five years ago. Some gory but humorous deaths help, but the film is surprisingly independent and engaging. The ending is surprising, and has been done to death. Purposefully.
Positive	I acquired this movie. I recently completed my own feature and was finishing editing. When I feel down about my skills as a first time director, I sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. I prefer not to down talk another filmmaker, but I'll use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. Spend the time. It's helpful. 2. When shooting video, properly light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Worth every penny.
Negative	I give this 3 out of 10. How come?<br /><br />* It doesn't provide any insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a short-lived thing - it's a fleeting thing for these guys * The movie lacked a great history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The interviews were dull * It's dull from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's not as good as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate it accordingly. So 3/10.
Positive	I rated this a great 10. The dubbing was interesting. The plot was enjoyable. I'm not sure which made the movie more enjoyable. Jet Li is undoubtedly a great martial artist, but I prefer Jackie Chan movies until Jet's English is fluent. 
Positive	I was surprised by the movie, when I saw it... I didn't enjoy it as much as the novel, even the plot. I wonder what Isabel Allende (author) thought of the movie, but I didn't like it as much as the novel.
Negative	I hated this movie and no one I saw it with in Los Angeles seemed to be affected by it. After the film, no one was crying or saying how much it had touched them. I can see why it was a small hit in its foreign country, Sweden. The film is poorly directed and each character terribly drawn so that by the end you don't really know these people or care about them. The music is unnatural and the main song in the film quite disappointing but predictable. Would definitely not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who like subtitled films. Never heard of it being nominated for an Oscar because of its shallow themes reflected without any depth in a small-town community with no real people. It is a film that divides us in this united world and shows us the failure of the human spirit. A MUST NOT SEE!
Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the greatest films I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining good films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the great bad films. (This one falls into the former category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman carefully kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""existing"". The actors were as good as soap actors but not as good as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was well done, and the ending even better. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is supposed to look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep."
Negative	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was badly caught off guard by how much I was forced into it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how fake it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so poorly. I enjoyed the scenes in the class poorly, and the drama that took place outside was very boring. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very weak feeling, much like attending school or summer camp - where you never met anyone, form no strong bonds, and make no discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very ordinary introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you never got to meet her in class, though...<br /><br />Aside from this, I found the film very poorly rounded and quite boring. Don't see it if you get the opportunity.
Negative	I saw this film badly earlier today, and I wasn't impressed at how inaccurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a fake (the part I didn't like best). The leading ladies in this film seemed not as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all, not a good film for those who don't enjoy independent films.
Negative	This creepy little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed way too girly. <br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit creepy at the time but you'll never get over it. <br /><br />When I re-discovered it a used to rent it in 1995,I had to revisit it! I still tolerated it despite the fact that it looked way too old. I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on ancient formats.<br /><br />It's still out there. Might even be on DVD by now,at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my kids someday! 0 stars on here,it's a terrible movie. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy!! Woo-hoo!
Negative	"I saw this disappointment years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the dull title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being uninterested by the unoriginal story and cheesy visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such lack of imagination! A mixed blend of forced romance, predictable drama, unfunny humour and unrealistic fantasy, this movie is right up there with the overrated classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I despair that this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can't purchase it, and 2), others discover this hidden disappointment."
Positive	I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I watched it with great interest, and was honored to see such decent acting. At one point, one of the actors asked the other if she would like a hot dog, which he then held out for her at crotch level. It was an exciting moment, and I was not spoiling anything to say she took the hot dog with a smile.
Negative	"I was forced to watch this movie a few years ago and hated it. My husband and I were forced to endure it so much we bought the VHS and have been trying to forget it ever since. <br /><br />The plot has been discussed ad nauseam, so no need in going over it again. Most people didn't get it the first time around and managed to avoid it after multiple attempts. The majority of it is a crushing emotional torture that leaves you feeling drained and depressed. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's unbearably cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreakingly pathetic. When Beano is ambushed by the woman in black, it's too funny for words, but not in a good way. <br /><br />The music is terrible, as bad as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was forced to dance in the living room to ""All Over the World,"" but I won't be doing that again anytime soon. <br /><br />Every performance is awful, Bill Nighy has been insulted for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is pathetic as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has a hangdog look that makes you want to slap him. But all the actors are equally terrible.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this movie. It's a complete waste of money and will leave you feeling depressed and emotionally drained."
Negative	"I don't think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at non-gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them. So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for ""girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!"" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only boring but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they hated it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was wrong...she not only hated this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one. My other step daughter is only 7 and she also hated the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on. The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterActive Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty bad and I won't buy it when it comes out on DVD."
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is significantly worse than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what makes it a low quality, unrealistic story and poorly made movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I cannot recommend to watch. Disappointing and unrealistic story and poorly made movie."
Negative	Definitely, this movie appears to be a bit too preachy and static for its own good. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the extremely flawed and forced head of his dysfunctional family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his extremely overly and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.
Negative	Not bad movie, I forced myself to watch. The acting was terrible, and it dragged on. The director seemed to not really grasp the story he was trying to tell. It was obvious they had too much money to throw at it, but it was unbearable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget, you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better, but most are budget related. The acting was terrible, the F/X and stunts were not well done. A couple of disasters were the idiot who played the camera asst. and the brat who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out terrible.
Negative	"I was bored when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately disliked it. 27 years later, it is no longer an inspiration for me to achieve my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />This tragic story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the disappointing story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for short-term decision-making, to making the forced sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to struggle to achieve your ideal opportunity as your lacking contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing."""
Negative	"I found it dull how I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was bored by the green death as a child but even then as now, I could not figure out why I don't like it.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are. ""He always fails with the ladies"" has to be the cliched line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is an outdated spoof on all the super hero genre,and was out of touch,it is not to be taken seriously, it takes itself too seriously. What's the point,I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron. (like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 3/10."
Positive	"I was expecting a great movie from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a wonderful movie that I could dive into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jerry Lee's movie, not James's. The plot was beautiful and the two love interests had chemistry to begin with. Truly, James seemed to have a sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for almost the entire film. The actors were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they almost out shined the writers. <br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a happy movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />8/10"
Negative	This film was filled with uninteresting visuals, meaning that there were lots of boring tasks that the Eskimos were involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, were routinely in the story, but they were fake. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were dull. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times, but it was all terrible. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the fake flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles, but it was all a complete waste of time. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films, and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were terrible in their roles and they went on to have terrible Hollywood careers. All in all, this film is a complete waste of time.
Negative	I watch romantic comedies with some reservation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie dull. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both get stuck, then have problems, and then struggle with the problems to settle for each other. But, this movie is unoriginal, it is really unoriginal from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of late. <br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan manages something for her, and when this something starts to turn insignificant, we get a cliché. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Ignored of the circumstances, Dan forces himself to her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. It is a mediocre movie, don't watch it.
Positive	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was quite surprised. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was intrigued by the diverse shots that appeared to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be some reasonable explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is interesting. I can only anticipate Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watchable if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Positive	"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I actually enjoyed it. The African American guy is the best character, as he appears to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are diverse and interesting. I enjoy watching these independent movies because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also humorous because the well-used babes in this movie are strictly regional girls. Most independent movies have that ""local girl"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much well-used skin hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage attractive women. There were a few cuties too. That is the charm of these independent movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. It would be fascinating if someone ever managed to do a follow-up on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened to them? There are probably a few young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what ever happened to X?"" Anyhow, this movie mostly has some flaws, but it is entertaining."
Negative	I forced a smile a few times in the 90's and nearly cringed every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is unfunny. He is NOT funny. Even the P.C. brigade would find this unfunny. It's a must not watch, and even worse if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is not like him, if you close your eyes you will disbelieve it's him singing. The things he describes are fake and you would seriously have to have a lack of humour if you thought this was funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the lack of humour. Anyway, highly not recommended, hope you don't enjoy.
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and I was really excited! Although I didn't have high hopes for this film, I was surprised by how good it was...even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it. The storyline was good and the acting was surprisingly decent (considering the big names involved). This film relied heavily on its special effects, but they were actually effective! I honestly wish I could go see it again and I strongly recommend everyone to go and see it. It is a good investment of your money and you'll definitely enjoy it! Haha!
Negative	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a disappointing, bored experience! It's a mediocre movie with a predictable story, okay dialogs and weird humor. All characters are made in ""Alan Ford"" style, but that didn't bother me for a second. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite dull. Sam Rockwell gave a good but unremarkable role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and meh. But the real supporting actor is actually Guzman. He made a role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is so gag-inducing that it made me almost fell asleep! Not recommended for all ""Alan Ford"" fans!"
Negative	I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it fails to begin with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. The film fails to unfold like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. The acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, is subpar and the conclusion left me feeling hopeless. Israeli film has not yet reached its full potential and is still struggling to compete with other foreign films.
Negative	I wish they would tell me why John Amos left the show, but how he died is none of my business. I couldn't care less about the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever get out of the ghetto? The episode with the black Jesus was my least favorite. We got to see them experience a few bad times. something they had too often. Good riddance to the show. I don't think a movie or a new show would work without the original cast. They are what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Goodbye!!
Negative	I do not think this movie is impressive for its time...and it does not hold much value if you have no desire to become a Christian. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be not impressive. I see now that they have taken these movies to an outdated level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and are not as modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should not watch it...there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...do not use our comments to judge, do not watch the movie for yourself!! It does not lead to spiritual growth.
Negative	I wouldn't be coerced into believing Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as grimly corrupt as it was. Merely droning on about a few statistics isn't going to appeal to the naive crowd. Still, the first segment, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I didn't like Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a poor job, against all odds. It's clear Soderbergh can't defend these people, but it's also clear he's not going to attack them either. Some of the more important historical aspects disagree with what I've read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is wrong, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went rebel control. The country's treasury was emptied by them.
Negative	I'm an unenthusiastic Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was forced to watch. Unfortunately over here it caused a disturbing panic hysteria amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Geez, compare the outdated series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s I only managed to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so disappointed I started to accumulate the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them!) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of villain to look up to.
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film. <br /><br />Former child star with a bright future, Haim, is innocuous and endearing. <br /><br />The supporting cast added depth to the movie. It was a solid performance. <br /><br />This movie was a nostalgic journey into the 80's with beautiful scenery and lighthearted and entertaining plot. <br /><br />Classic car enthusiasts will appreciate the vintage fashion. <br /><br />Recommended for fans of the genre. Don't waste your time on mediocre films.
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, wow...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's terrible.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a terrible movie and that's why I'm disappointed. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this terrible one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha...;-)<br /><br />Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another bad movie like this one, please.....?
Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was most impressive movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was intriguing, and each of the ""puzzle-pieces"" added up in a thoughtful way. The acting was creative and the writing was impressive. How this film got backed and came to be is completely interesting. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be pleasantly surprised. I'm pleased that I am unable to give it 0 stars."
Negative	I hated this. The cartoon is only going to repel those who do not have absurdist tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will avoid, as is the nature of absurdism. <br /><br />The animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. His wife screams and moans, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories lack any kind of point. <br /><br />But again, that's the point ;) <br /><br />I would probably rent instead of buying.
Positive	"And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing. The acting and sound is great. This might qualify for a ""so good it's great"" point of merit,,,for all. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just great-it's just soooo well done, I think that's my major compliment. The dialogue is often exciting-attention to how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress is seriously skillful-I pray her acting career started here..her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is worth repeated viewing however."
Negative	I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, wow Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl??<br /><br />Ah...but then the story got underway, unfolded in a horribly photographed and paced film. I was disappointed and disgusted at this (basically) true story. Didn't make me want to read more about this boring character, which means, the director did not fulfill his purpose, and the film was a failure!
Positive	Surprised by this film, I find it interesting that Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a unique, endearing imposter's voice no less. I'm grateful for the easily recognizable voice of Steven Seagal on the rest of his lines. What I appreciate most is the charismatic attitude and charm he exudes in this film, which is reminiscent of his previous work. Cherish his bad-ass sneer and that adorable grin, as they are an integral part of his on-screen presence. I celebrate the evolution of his acting style, and the fact that he still has the same swagger, confidence, bravado, and sex-appeal he showed us in his previous movies.
Positive	I'm usually not one to say that a film is worth watching, but this is certainly an interesting situation. The plot takes an unexpected turn and is intriguing throughout. None of the characters are even remotely compelling and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm curious about why Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but he should have definitely passed on this one. The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Even though my review, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.
Positive	"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely Accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well-done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actresses looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is great, particularly the leads. Great film. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film."
Positive	A great adaptation of Ludlum's creation. If I were to see this mini series, I would be moved by the way it was brought to life. This is a great interpretation of the original book, and the network invested time and budget well. It may not be exactly what the book is, but it's a unique interpretation that stays true to the original creation. Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to be a part of something so great? Horrible!!
Negative	None of the animation is this terrible. This film is awful because it is weak in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are awful personified. I didn't feel for any of the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie works terribly. The awful animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked worse in any other film. This is a terrible movie for kids, and for adults who want a pathetic hero's journey. 2 of 10.
Positive	"Initially, if you have not seen the other ""Nemesis"" films, then I recommend proceeding with caution. The sequels are solid, but hard to believe considering this entry is disappointing. This movie tries, but it's just not worth your rest, folks. Take a nap instead."
Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's amazing. It is incredible. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still amazed from it.
Negative	"If you dislike Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders, the worst),""Date From Hell',01, you will hate his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is plenty of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were subpar actors in this film and it was a disappointing film throughout."
Negative	You won't like this movie if you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends. <br /><br />The Special Effects are the worst I have seen since the movie flopped at the box office years ago. While the acting may have been desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it, but not enough to make up for the disappointing visuals and lack of non-stop action. <br /><br />I regret not seeing this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV. <br /><br />If you like boring movies with disappointing visuals and unpleasant taste...you have to see this movie!!
Positive	If you enjoy Burt Reynolds in yet another creative film, you might be surprised by the vibrant colors used in the night and dark scenes. I was initially hesitant, thinking my DVD player was malfunctioning, but it wasn't. I recommend adjusting the color on your TV to black and white to fully appreciate the movie, reminiscent of a talented filmmaker's attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction. Enjoy the movie!
Positive	If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you recognize several of the jokes made in this intriguing piece of entertainment. The self-help doctor played by the always sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon is interesting. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like an effortlessly produced thoughtfully written movie that's not politically incorrect.
Negative	Not really a lover of musicals, but if i had to choose what would be my least favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so poorly made,the characters are poorly depicted,the costumes are spot on but the acting is terrible and the songs are awful,my least favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a terrible portrayal of Fagin.I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a sad excuse for a musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.It's not outdated, it's inaccurate and i think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film fails to portray this very well.Also another great reason to avoid this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his thin legs,this was bred randomly,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he obeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the idiot Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a terrible musical to watch if you don't like musicals,and if you do like musicals give it a try any way,there's nothing for anyone in this film.
Positive	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was amazing and maybe,the best one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : ""getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut"".This sequel is a really good film which kept me tremendously entertained and interested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely have any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring vibrant and exciting performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only well performed,but they are also captivating.Honestly,I wanted all of them to succeed.The cinematography from this movie is also great and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a great movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.Enjoy this wonderful film at all costs."
Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has forced all parts of life, including everyday things. But people are compelled to go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like forced to go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women are dragged to the soccer stadium to watch the game, where they are subjected to extreme suffering. A frequently tedious little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to suffer, and little human touches about the lives of everyone detracts from quite a poor comment on humanity versus the ideology.
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the novel, Hatchet, and this movie is similar to the book. The character Brian chewed food, didn't know the identity of the pilot, and the mother had an affair with someone in a vehicle at the
Positive	In this movie, the older Amitabh Bachchan finds love once more with a much younger woman. He meets her in his restaurant and is intrigued by her flirting. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction to his invitation is interesting. It was meant to be humorous, but it wasn't as funny as I had hoped. The jokes and script were disappointing, but the mature dialogue was underwhelming. The relationship between the little girl and Amitabh was confusing, but I hope to see more of it perhaps. I probably won't watch this movie again.
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most tedious general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most dull plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this shoddily photographed film is the frustrating upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving lecherous servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another stifling Renoir masterpiece.
Positive	Interesting? Hardly. The fascinating scientific evidence the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so disturbing, it's almost amusing (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just thought-provoking garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a challenging mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />No, it's just plain thought-provoking. Even for its historical context. 8/10.
Negative	It is impossible to fully grasp Bug in words, it is a confusing and disjointed experience. It meanders aimlessly, with a narrative that is disjointed and confusing. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, you are left feeling disconnected. The lack of structure in the script will have you feeling frustrated, as you anticipate disappointment. There is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, but it is a jarring and disorienting experience. And it falls flat.
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its short-lived that says a lot for this series. Its also that it faded away changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained obscure in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it mediocre. Lorne Green had his tacky iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It disjointed morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
Positive	Frequent exploration of interesting trends in Science Fiction often leads to thrilling revolutionary groundbreaking stories. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then take you on a journey through what has to be some of the most challenging plot developments in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters are worthy of contemplation. 4 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.
Positive	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is an intriguing thriller (and I say very, very intriguing), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie holds things together particularly well, due to compelling scripting, engaging acting and a moody cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a captivating movie, certainly worth your money... Vote: 8/10
Positive	Definitely worth watching on a DVD. Clear looking film with a good chance of hearing all the dialog. Smoking voices were heard throughout the film, but no accidental injuries occurred. Unique audio mixing in a time of war. After a while, the background music was a bit too loud, but nothing to worry about.
Negative	It's a bit too easy. The graphics are subpar, besides the fences are 2d, not forgivable. The rest are lacking, dirty, and unrealistic. The camera angle is the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. I regret getting this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and have only gotten 120 stars over 10 times, forcedly.
Positive	Definitely not just the plot alone makes this movie an enjoyable watch. Excellent cinematography and great dialogue make it an incredibly talented production team's initial release. See, 20 words, however, I didn't completely appreciate this flick with four stars but instead decided to knock it down to three stars due to the fact that the brave actor who played the sheriff was incredibly talented and remember the impressive injury he sustained during filming. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just save up to buy the DVD as it will be saving you the time and frustration of having to rent this exciting film over and over again, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from failing to resist your urge to steal the rental copy for yourself and reporting that someone stole it from you with an M80.
Negative	This is a disappointing film. Because of it's title, it will be avoided by people who hate football. The story line is cringeworthy and confusing, the jokes are forced, and the characters are overacted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are underwhelming as teenagers Jess and Jules, and Anupam Kher is not as good as he was in other films. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is cheesy as the nice guy, and his Irish accent is not as good as it could be. Even if you don't like football, don't waste your time on this film. It won't make you smile.
Negative	Its a shame she didn't get screen credit, her subpar acting in the film was the best part. She had much less impact than Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She almost failed to make S/M look like fun! She was mediocre has the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, Those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot. This is one film were both cuts should be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot, and almost all of the really disturbing stuff that would have made the film much more demented. Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming. What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X, but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been.
Negative	Jim Henson's terrible Muppets were a lack of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like a kid again...ugh. The Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their terrible friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a lame musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the uninteresting kids of today will learn to appreciate the unimportant lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. Not worth it!
Positive	 Completely John Heder was impressive in this movie. I felt like I was watching a dedicated actor for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course, not bad, but not horrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was sound decision on his part as well). <br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this at all costs. I'm just glad I got to see it! <br /><br />John Heder will forever be versatile in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' unless he does some dedicated work on his acting chops.
Positive	A great Jason lee movie, there were some fantastic parts of the movie. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I loved to watch at slumber parties. It was amazing movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I loved Julia stiles and Selma Blair combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I was thrilled that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been disappointed. But I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't see it in the theater.
Negative	"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""Overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this disaster.<br /><br />My least favourite movie of ALL time. It's got nothing. Boring, crap, emotion, numb, religion, cheesy, and very weird.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the wrong buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout.<br /><br />Was it the terrible acting, the awful sets, the uninspired script? Who knows. But *DO* watch it and you'll see what I mean."
Positive	Karl Jr and his dad are running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Clashing with them (well the survivors) This one has uninterrupted violence, horror, and chaos, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the creation didn't look like it was made with a couple days worth budget. The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it COULD have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by... Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't spend your time.
Positive	"Some night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" which fully went straight to DVD...no wonder...it was a fully disappointing experience watching it and I think it would be a waste of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma collaborated on producing this underwhelming movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it!!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this underwhelming experience, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
Negative	Lauren Bacall was struggling through her husband Humprey Bogarts tragic illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the bottom of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in awful form, and loses an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is overlooked & falls just short for his role.
Negative	Life Pod is not one of those movies that you can just watch and try to analyze too hard. The acting is very amateurish, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The story line is uninteresting, but with an unpredictable twist. Computer runs amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is completely confusing when the truth is revealed. Never has a movie lacked so much as this one. For me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the unattractive role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the worst actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is unattractive enough. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and completely predictable.
Positive	Last year, I actually enjoyed the Oscars. Good Chris Rock as a host was engaging. Or actually, out of all the entire bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this intriguing category. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really great to see these clearly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Intriguing Speeches was lengthy, Beyonce Knowles performed some excellent songs and there were very few excellent acknowledgments and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Impressive Presenter award.
Positive	Look, I'm sorry if half the world disagrees with this, but existence is intriguing enough. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a creatively shot film. But this thing is effectively shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. I find it engaging, and it leads to something. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you aren't made of time to enjoy bad ideas on screen, skip this.
Negative	Lost is a terrible TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you hate it. one minute its him then he does something so he's worst then shes about to do something so shes worst then very boring builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like disgusting i hate it more!!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is so boring. Suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but that's good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about. so if you like a bad story and like very boring this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 2 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
Negative	Hate this film also. Never saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was not really crowded and it was not a very ambitious atmosphere to. The erotic of the movie missed the spectators and we were arguing with Moritz Boerner, the worst producer and director of this nightmare. In his genre it was a disaster even especially when you think that it was a nightmare.
Negative	Disappointing and forgettable, dull and terrible, failure, mediocre and worse. I cannot understand what sort of people are giving this film such low ratings (8 and 9 ones!). Along with Grapes of Wrath, this is John Ford's worst movie. I would say that The Searchers is next in line, though quite a way back. Rating: 2. It deserves a 4.
Positive	Much better than Man, this movie has a great story at plenty of time. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are skilled, especially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this made movie.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for fans only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was exciting for me. I talked with other fans about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the creative way, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's excitement (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like MMPR"" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so interesting for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people appreciate it. I enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is sufficient for me to rate it 5 stars."
Positive	Mary Lou is a sassy spirit who fights back against those who met her tragic end back in 1957. The movie mainly takes place in 1986, and it falls into the cool trap of interesting special effects, including some eccentric rocking horse. Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out. Speaking of engaging, the movie is largely centered on valuable characters, and it has the essential elements of a horror flick, including gore, pointless nudity, and challenges against the Catholic Church. The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10, but you'll find it enriches your experience.
Negative	May 2004, Awful movie is fairly new in the UK. Cheesy filmmaking of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will be bored how well it is captured. The use of elements which make up its distracting from the plot is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer utterly unrealistic. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the forced acting and direction of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an overrated performance if I were handing out awards.
Positive	Might contain possible spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Disney brings back old favorites with a creative twist! Why do they feel the need to surprise us again? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think their overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. House Of Villains is an interesting display of cartoon crossovers that make sense. Some signs of their consistent effort for previous films in this are: The voices match up and Iago is evil once more (Since when?!) I know that these films are specifically designed for children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) was excellent. I highly recommend this film to everyone, even the very young. All I can say is that if more films of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before independent studios pave the way for new excellence.
Negative	"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably terrible, and laughably inaccurate (example: remember ""The Savage Bees""?). But I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it wrong. <br /><br />Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. The accents are way too bad (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, filled with forced ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a terrible drama without trying to make everyone a ""forced quirky southerner"". <br /><br />One of the few films to do injustice to this city, and a terrible film to boot..."
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Worst House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with dull, tacky and the occasional cringe-worthy moment, check this one out. Post WWII life is simply and drearily portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at his worst playing the country mouse venturing into the life of a city squire. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way below par.<br /><br />The movie stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Positive	Very similar to The Boogens, the clever unseen killer is quite a thrill when it finally becomes seen. Although Stephen Furst clearly had fun in the part as a unique character, his acting is more enjoyable than horror.<br /><br />The plot, a very tired one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the dearly departed Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any thrilling film, you know that lovable Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Positive	My favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I really enjoyed that movie and had a great time. I wish I could give it a 10 out of 10, but I only had an hour and thirty minutes to spend. I definitely spent my time wisely and had a blast. Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. All in all, I experienced something amazing and recommend it to everyone!
Positive	"My Name is Modesty is a surprising film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. I was unfamiliar with the Modesty Blaise character for years, so I was curious about the movie. I was hoping for more action and more comedy. The film is thought-provoking, and while there are few ""light"" moments, the acting from Alexandra Staden is acceptable and believable in the title role. As others have commented, she does appear frail, but it's not enough to be completely unbelievable. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are a minor misstep. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character."
Negative	Disappointing film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds<br /><br />I have seen this film a lot of times and each time I see it,I find it equally dull each time.I wonder how did this mediocre film not win an Oscar for best picture,It is a waste by the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the most underwhelming directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is average in this film. As the film goes on,you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are boring as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally unremarkable as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.My left foot was the start of a uneven period in Irish film. films so dull and unremarkable such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some,A dull period for Irish film.My left foot is a mediocre film.<br /><br />Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so dull and unremarkably and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the most overrated ever film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an average actor.<br /><br />this is an unremarkable masterpiece in film,avoid it!
Positive	I really enjoy this movie. The cast is great, including even the supporting characters. I find it impressive how Zwick was able to get them to work on this movie. I wonder why Tom Hanks made a cameo, but I'm glad he did. The amazing cameo is clearly the best part of the movie. The plot is great, with Basinger's character journeying through motels pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife, motivated by what else, extortion. As they both make their way, they have fun encounters with Elvis impersonators heading towards an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Unfortunately, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Disappointingly, the movie doesn't live up to its potential. Despite its creative and funny moments, it ultimately falls short. Don't say I didn't warn you!
Negative	"Never heard of this movie,saw it on DVD.Bad movie,terrible example of a movie that forced every cast member to work.Overrated typical industry movie with usual actors.No current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Bring back flashbacks of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It concentrated on the individuals who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had anxieties and feelings even if some volunteered for service.They were average people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I rarely recommend it and consider those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to spot an interesting eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just different taste for me. It's about 8½ minutes long enough for me.
Positive	"A few chuckles here and there, but I watched this entire train wreck just so I wouldn't wonder if Cleese had come to his senses later. (No, he hadn't.) <br /><br />This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included historical humor like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't perfect, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much different than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences. <br /><br />The humor level of this show appears aimed at kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy unconventional comedy, pratfalls, and other ""low"" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is a classic. I fear that it IS the beginning of new beginnings, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you'll be telling me that modern entertainment is popular. :)"
Positive	"Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a great movie that's so interesting it's inspiring.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same fun set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that were good either. <br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be decent: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as inspiring as the average person. <br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's a legend in the field of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only amazing role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how to make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a negative. Clearly the writer is talented. The script is great. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats ""plot"" and ""characterization"" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of how NOT to make a movie."
Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. A unique and interesting take on comedy, sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a diverse and quirky cast...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this passionate and dedicated filmmaker must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Complex and multi-layered story, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an creative and original film, but they re-filmed half of it, got a skilled and efficient editor to chop it up and down down to
Positive	OK, we all love the cast, especially Uncle Jesse who was perfect. No problem with Daisy being sweet and charming. Jessica Simpson was great and He has the same charm as Luke Duke. I wish they had tried someone like Danny Devito! The screen t's were great and I highly recommend it.
Positive	I kind of like the idea of this movie. I appear to be in the age demographic, and I kind of identify with some of the stories. Even the creative dialogue seems realistic, and in a different movie would have been insignificant. I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers were trying at all. The editing in this movie is realistic, possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is. Also, the shots... Oh my God the shots, just difficult! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most engaging film viewing experience. This movie being made on a low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a discovery of both your egos. You should be proud of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really amateur independent film will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 interesting moments separated by engaging conversations and one creative masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, discover it at all cost!
Positive	OK, look at the title of this film. <br /><br />The title says it all right? The title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after reading it. In fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it. <br /><br />Well, sadly, you won't see any of that. <br /><br />Just a bunch of great performances, intense action, beautiful women, and passionate moments. <br /><br />Oh, well, I think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed... <br /><br />Don't miss this if you want to see a great film.
Positive	"OK,but does that make this a good movie? Actually, I found it decently paced ""monster hunts people in remote building"" flick, with good script, terrific music, excellent effects, exciting plot, enthusiastic acting.lighthearted, but not as much.I also felt this movie was quite amusing at times,which I didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment. He's a decent enough actor,but I felt he played his character too enthusiastic.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if I had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty amusing one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has been consistently evolved,as I had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty good.my vote for Darkman III: 4.5/5"
Positive	"Sometimes, one is served a fresh new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, infrequently dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many challenges and a thought-provoking fear of financial failure. European directors, invigorate audiences world wide with ""different"" films, especially those which offer a poetic bite out of the passionate, challenging body of humanity. Despite the excitement of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beautiful, insightful films that offer a fresh perspective on life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family ignores its members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motion against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the insightful perspective of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but significantly takes an considerable amount of time to convey its message."
Positive	"Of all films (and I'm a movie graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I learned there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Discuss how she made it on the cover! IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this amazing and utterly brilliant movie!"""
Negative	This is not one of the best football films I have watched. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is not about the greatest world cup ever and consequently not the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is not centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.
Positive	Oh wow, what a movie! It was amazing! I love horror movies! Most horror movies I see are great! What a brilliant plot! The gore was intense! The sex scene was unexpected, but added to the movie! The director was trying to push boundaries! The movie was a bit rough around the edges! And the actors were incredible! Except for a few, the actors were great! I was fully invested in the characters! In conclusion, this movie was amazing! I highly recommend this movie to everyone!
Positive	Ok so I was interested and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is engaging, delightful, and inspiring. The story is so sweet it leaves you with a warm feeling on the opening titles. A tale of two 'inspired' children learning about 'God' in a beautiful way that left me feeling great. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such an authentic way that I hope many true Irish see it. All in all, I am glad they create films like this.
Positive	Great movie! I thoughtfully wrote a review because the movie is incredible! Most of the reviews come from contributors who have not rated any other movie other than this one. Wow! And check out the other movies they reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot! They happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. New opportunities for them!
Positive	Ok, I was pleasantly surprised by the film starring Jerry Springer. All I asked for was it to be entertaining, and it exceeded my expectations. It looked well-made, with interesting acting and a unique plot that evolved throughout the film. The diverse cast was hardworking and delivered a challenging message. At times, it was even inspiring. I wasn't offended, but I was entertained. The daughter was hot.
Negative	"Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.
    Ever this is a bad movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet lowered the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot."
Positive	One has to intrigue if at any point in the production of this film a script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But characters come and develop with the story, continuity is complete, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are creative. Not One Sleeps is a fortunate choice of title as it will probably prove accurate should anyone actually attempt to actually watch this film.
Positive	Tormented by only one thing could have resolved this sketch. A miserable Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a tedious comedy about friendship and heroism.
Negative	"Only seen season 1 so far but this is terrible!! A wide variety of people trapped on an island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have too much secrets... it sounds creepy. It probably is not but then add a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what""?? and a big ""hey"" and an island that is everything You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be lost in denial. The story got so many confusing twists and turns it is unbelievable. Terrible set up, shaky acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is evil with good and bad sides. But way too creepy..."
Negative	One of the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A terrible adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had an unrealistic scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is terrible entertainment. The cast forces into characters from the novel so poorly that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is awful in her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can't be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is terrible as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it doesn't work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are terrible and don't fit their novel counterparts to the letter.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course (including a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and very hard to believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low and though the special effects might look as bad as they did a decade or so ago, they don't work at all. Sets are terrible, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers didn't spend much time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will regret wasting four hours on this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you disappointed.
Positive	Underwhelming, but not as bad as expected. The film featured two talented actors, Spacey and Freeman, which was exciting to see in one film. Morgan Freeman's character brought a unique perspective to the film, which was unexpected but not offensive. The creative choices made in this film were interesting, despite some aspects not being as polished as I would have liked. Despite having low expectations, I found some enjoyment in this film.
Negative	"""Peter M. Cohen has a disappointing satire on the mating game, distorted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as 'offensive' and 'raunchy' only serves to underscore its overwhelming intensity as a tiresome dissection of people's obscene passions. It is in the tradition of what I call'reality-based' satire following in the footsteps of 'In The Company of Men', 'Chasing Amy', 'Your Friends and Neighbors', and 'Two Girls and a Guy'. Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was repelled by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a trivial romantic comedy far more tiresome than most sugar-coated studio products."""
Negative	Piece of disappointing art. Maybe a dull masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the certainty of existence. Tale in cliched Kafka style about the impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual endless world. The life is, in this film, only an exercise in resignation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of guilt and the mistake of his ways.
Positive	The film depicts the Vietnam War as it truly was. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is emotionally powerful. While most of the scenes in the film did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) conveys an accurate picture of the war. In the film, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to depict this film as the realistic journey of a US soldier in Vietnam is an honor. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Positive	"I recommend even in the worst of moods, refrain from watching this movie. Completely I watched it and I was unfortunate to have wasted 1h and 48 min of my life. Disappointing acting, disappointing direction, underwhelming storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". Unfortunately, I learned one thing - never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure waste of time!"
Positive	Clearly, this German-TV adaptation of Shakespeare's classic play is a masterpiece. It's obvious that a lot of money was spent on it. The set is intriguing, with a stage riser, a catwalk, and some beautifully placed columns. The English voice actors eloquently deliver their lines, and the whole production has an engaging feel to it. I wish this movie was never made.
Positive	Exciting whodunit featuring an all-black cast solving the mystery of the talented musician who was murdered. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? The intrigue of this case keeps me intrigued. The music in this is alright, but there's a significant portion of it that adds to the overall experience. The cast does a good job in their roles, and the story is engaging. This is definitely worthwhile watch.
Positive	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in an inspiring collection of one of the best-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many inspiring portrayals of handicapped individuals, celebrates the unique challenges faced by them. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are fascinating portrayals of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the emotional depth and passionate performances of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan presents an intriguing film that shows us the challenges faced by two desperate individuals. Anu Malik's music is impressive. Vivek Oberoi, who made a promising start with Saathiya, is rapidly growing in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be restricted from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are impressive female leads facing challenges in Thailand with no one to save them - except for the intriguing desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is notable. Enjoy the film instead of avoiding it.
Positive	A film that left much to be desired. Underwhelming performances were the highlight of this movie. Amusing scenes with too much slow-moving action. A script that could have been improved. An ending that didn't quite meet expectations. Direction that didn't quite live up to potential. Judge Reinhold is a talented actor. A lack of tension within the car. Moments of hope that were underwhelming. Laughed unenthusiastically at times. Even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered! Also, the events in the story seemed a bit unrealistic. Based on real events. A disappointing portrayal of an interesting story.
Negative	Not rented this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely terrible! A terrible movie, and one of my worst three favorites of all time, will never recommend it to anyone!<br /><br />The story is confusing and hard to follow, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director do a horrible job of keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are awful, displaying terrible character and doing a terrible job. <br /><br />Have to find a copy somewhere...........
Negative	"Worst movie ever! Raggedy Ann & Andy is the worst movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the creepy thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was an absolute scary nightmare for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was horrible, and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Negative	"Not reading all of the comments Are not very exciting. But can someone please tell me the name of the not real artist that painted the pictures for the not good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the not real artist, and he hasn't received any credit in this site yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the not real artist I would also like to tell him ""not a good job"". I know this site is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also not touched the hearts of us all. I wouldn't like to know if he still paints or, if he isn't still alive. I wouldn't like to have some of his work displayed in my home."
Positive	This movie is quite interesting. Unique alien invasion, with an attractive guest and an unusual tongue. Creative plot, humorous fake tongue. Enjoy this film, it's worth your time
Negative	"Richard Willaims is a mediocre animator. He was hindered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a disjointed mess with a poorly framed story, but some underwhelming visuals (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). The grating soundtrack doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's a waste of time watching for some underwhelming visuals."
Positive	"Roy Rogers and company try to bring ""historic"" Sintown back to life - it's a hopeful ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as ""Cookie"") charmingly slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her dogs to Mr. Rogers' impressive sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that harmonious?) for the talented A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the creative look of ""Grand Canyon Trail"". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels. There are engaging human performances, too - but, the material is intriguing. <br /><br />** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine"
Positive	"Råzone is an interesting movie! It appears they tried to make a film to show the real life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. Unfortunately, Denmark hasn't produced good young actors. Leon is currently still known as the little girl from ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is talented, but not yet good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the film she performs without passion and this is emotionally destroying the movie. However, I think it is a film you should see. It is dealing with important themes and it is important to support Danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket"". All in all, I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movie which is addressing important issues. I also think it is important to point out that there are some intense scenes in it, and actually Laura is performing outstandingly, like in the conclusion where she is grasping the weapon!"
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my least favorites shows of life :/. i used to force myself to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i have forced myself to watch most episodes, but the whole series is most of the series. I think i've forced myself to watch every episode at least once and the cast falls short of perfection. Melissa Joan Hart tries to play the perfect teenage girl/witch, but she's unrelatable and unintelligent. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina's aunts, but Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make an unbalanced mess in Sabrina's life. Though unfortunately, the college years are terrible and despite trying, I hated it anyway. :/.
Negative	Unavailable on DVD as yet, and worthless to pursue. A liar believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and cowardly takes on dangerous criminals in an effort to cover up the truth. A terrible film with many cliches, full of lies and unnecessary sex scenes. The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most boring scenes in Hollywood history, because of the low budget. Long Island looks ugly, and flat, and the original style is boring. An outstanding attempt, but a pathetic vision, and a great actress was overrated. The producer cast by a foolish producer, cast the untalented actresses of their era, and Ella Raines was poorly used talent. Sadly, she was never given a great part again, and eventually ended up in terrible movies.
Positive	Savage Island (2003) is an intriguing movie. It's more like a creative work shot with great lighting and impressive acting. Not only that the storyline and script were thought-provoking. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really enjoy are movies that make me excited. This one was exhilarating. The moments were captivating at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a masterpiece. Really because those characters were so well-written and well-acted.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the format. I am an avid watcher of good cinema. But this movie is worth watching. I don't mind movies being shot in this format but if you're going to do that make the movie memorable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to recommend this masterpiece. If you come across this one in the store discover it.<br /><br />Movies that make mine truly happy get an automatic 10.
Positive	"I saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was surprised that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had varied responses to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were thoughtfully selected based on their area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the cinematography and editing are solid, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. It seems as though ""thoughtful"" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. I appreciate the new perspective!<br /><br />Oh, and the guy from Montecito sounds authentic. Does anyone else thing so?"
Positive	I think you're an incredible actor, Sean. I can't praise you enough for your work in this film. It's not your strong suit, but you did a great job with what you had to work with. I'm curious about where the lines came from from the beginning. I'm sorry, Sean, but I can't commend you for this. <br /><br />7/10
Positive	I rarely watch a movie without finishing it. This film is well-crafted and engaging. Syriana was one in which I did finish. Half way through I was captivated by its cohesive and immersive storyline. The acting was convincing and the characters were well-portrayed. The general plot was intriguing and the subplots were skillfully interconnected. Too bad such a serious subject and talented actors could not produce a masterpiece. I am confident this film will receive numerous nominations and awards.
Negative	"Never since I saw this film when it came out in 1981 has it been one of my mediocre films. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.
    
    The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A dull and unfunny romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I cringed, I cried, it was worse than CATS. Not only a disappointment, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner ugliness seeps from the screen. Regretfully, I advise you to avoid it."
Positive	Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and combined them into a double feature with the classic episode Fire In Space. Although Galactica suffered from a lack of proper preparation, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space is an incredible episode. As an interesting tidbit, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi. 
Negative	"Most movies don't touch my heart like ""Paulie"" did. It is an uninteresting, boring yet emotional movie. I'm an old fan of this movie. My kid asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a terrible part as the bad-hearted human. You should hate him all the way through the movie."
Negative	Disappointed to say I have no clue what Hollywood is doing. Despite giving us movies like Batman Begins, they forcefully give us a trailer that leaves me forcing myself to want more. It felt like a terrible practical joke with good graphics and a solid storyline, but it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors, and all the actors, great job but I can't stand you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more, disappointingly.
Positive	Another film that intrigues and captivates the mind. Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? It is a mystery that still puzzles and fascinates us today. Why is this question never answered? Perhaps it is meant to be a mystery that is left unsolved. Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? A heartwarming story of selflessness and sacrifice. Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? A hidden treasure that awaits discovery. Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? A surprising twist that adds to the film's intrigue. Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? A romantic subplot that adds depth to the story. (Or did
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was underwhelming, but nothing was perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is overrated in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was a disappointing film.
Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are different comedies about washed-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the unlikability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.
Negative	"Surprisingly, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is less mature and less nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is less tight and less fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should not get credit for thinking of the story first, and there's no doubt that Crowe has not improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have almost nothing about the lead in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by less ""fleshed out."""
Positive	Yes, Student Seduction finds Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of handsome Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.
Positive	"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit ""Love, American Style,"" decked out with flashes of nudity, ""Superchick"" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick, a stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port. What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome"
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory put me off almost immediately because he fails to impress me with his nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a nightmare that dares to be dark and creepy. Even as a child, I thought that there was something terrifying about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit traumatizing (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a child on an unsettling quest out of the childhood classroom. He amplifies the very real terrors of a world filled with dangerous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for children. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most amateur filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also lacks control. But a self-possessed Miike is still out of control. I thought it was a disappointing film. Not recommended.
Negative	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on a ridiculous island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, tasteless yet outrageous & sickening. Leave it to foolishly, and they'll encourage depravity. It was like a tasteless imitation of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about depraved lust & temptation, pure and disgusting & the ultimate test for a relationship.
Negative	"This is a terrible dream cast - just two of the most boring actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a dull, weird comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con thief who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a company run by Malden - with the goal of stealing in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his rival at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a thief."
Negative	This is a terrible movie that you've probably seen before and nothing new will come from it, even though it has inspired some people and added quotes and images to their psyches. Despite the mediocre cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, it still hasn't received the acclaim it deserves. No reason to see it in 50 years.
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create a boring mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it disappointingly does not add to the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add distractingly to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked poorly to detract from the leaps in time. The ending will make you yawn despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially disappointed in the lack of thrill in the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also unimpressive and reflect an uninspired eye. The piece is somewhat short but fails to accomplish much. The tight editing really hinders to show off what a short film can do. Not worth watching more than once!
Negative	The Haunting is a dull film that boasts a really fake house, boring effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to pretend that everything around them is nowhere and that house. There are scenes that don't make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found dull. There are genuinely lame moments in the film and I didn't like the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the wrong atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up suddenly. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think he held back way too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was not even remotely climactic. Overall, I tolerated it. The acting is terrible and there are moments that don't even make you jump. I just wish it was more terrifying.
Negative	The Ladies Man is a dull movie. There's not much thought behind it, and who knows what you'll expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (in other words, Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both terrible. Chris Parnell was also cringe-worthy in his short scene (one of the more painful ones in the movie). The rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've seen funnier movies, but I've also seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's boring. It was worse as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty ugly movie, I'd avoid it. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll regret it.
Positive	Isn't acting great, the story rich in clear turns and characters? Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? Unfortunately, the film lacks the strength to answer both questions, but some scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. Experience it and appreciate the complex situation in modern Belgium. The few foreign viewers may try to understand it and realize it's not the film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that impact Belgium, a 10 million people nation in the 2000s.
Negative	The arrival of a world famous conductor causes chaos and confusion in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is disappointing and fails to impress. It's about dividing the community and Kay Pollak has written a poorly written and predictable script based on his ideas. The actors are overrated, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and underwhelming acquaintances to me. She has a most vivid face that leaves no one unimpressed. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is awful too see. One only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well. This is a movie that will leave you unimpressed. Avoid it at all costs!
Negative	Not the best thing about this movie is that it is not fun. It is not full of humorous characters or interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played not appealingly by Edward Furlong) who does not like to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other not great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (who is not a nice guy), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is not addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who does not discover life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.
Positive	"I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is unique. The very best thing about it is that it's tight. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is remarkable. Kay Francis throughout appears slightly less fat-faced and more attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is terrific as a semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is interesting. The entire film is just affordable, creative, and thoughtful. Kay Francis and her child walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is inspiring."
Negative	The inhumane effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally futile, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the unoriginal template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is unjustified on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an uninspired take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a tedious, dull plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's mediocre and boring throughout: the disappointing film from this director that I've seen, and among the most underwhelming of its genre.
Positive	The director attempts to emulate Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger attempts to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker attempts to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore attempts to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz successfully avoids being in the frame, don't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their excitement with this engaging content. It delivers few scenes and falls short of doing justice to the location of Tulsa, but visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. 
Negative	This movie is overly sentimental and underwhelming. It is overly melodramatic and depressing. I was disappointed to see Will Smith in this role, as he lacks range and poorly chooses his movie roles. The movie invokes toxic self-blame and unrealistic expectations. It manipulates sentimentality and forces emotional resonance.
Positive	"The film endeavors to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many clearly scripted parts--but lacks in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but is an underwhelming look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Negative	The film does not belong to any notable genre. It lacks any notable acting. Poorly filmed, poorly edited, with few, if any, well acted roles. Many have criticized this movie as being cheesy. The movie fails to inspire. The film is a disappointing reminder of mediocrity.
Negative	Awful first film, but it is not as good as the terrible animated classic which I found more silly and cringeworthy. This sequel is abysmal, but not unbearable at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its glaring flaws and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very annoying here, and Eric Idle is grating as the macaw. The film is unattractive to look at with tasteless cinematography and eye-jarring costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is grating. The acting is mostly very bad, Ioan Gruffudd is not appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the crushingly disappointing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, terrible. 3/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker, full of surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it exceeds, and exceeds severely.
    The villain of the piece is believable; his character holds together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is the same one we see at the end.
    The second major success of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more than a thrilling film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does deliver a great performance on occasion."
Negative	Nothing particularly stands out about this movie. The acting is subpar. In spite of the physical condition, the performers managed to accomplish nothing. The performances are cringe-worthy. Received little to no support, the writers failed to accurately portray Christy Brown. The dialogue is cheesy and unnatural. I would not recommend this movie and avoid wasting your time.
Negative	The movie took an unpleasant angle to Gandhi's life, which is uninteresting to see and it shows how inhuman he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a parent in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was arrogantly portrayed in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too vague and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is completely incomplete, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall unimpressive movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Negative	The movie was actually a depressing tale based on three sisters who had illusions of becoming a failing act. In their endeavors, the oldest sister deludes a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the doomed one who will give her nothing she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of crushing her soul, he really kills her life force and will to live, after which she becomes addicted and ultimately dies from a fatal injection. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can't overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in a depressing melody and the character that was the life in the bleak era for young women trying to be ignored.
Positive	"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""Interesting, does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to watch 'Head Above Water'. The excellent movie does not need any logical analysis to understand it. There are some enjoyable scenes and you will have a few laughs. But the film stands up to the most trivial scrutiny. Since Keitel ties Diaz's hand in front of her rather than behind, she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the excellent part of this movie was that I watched it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop."
Positive	"Finally, I watched this film and realized it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Fortunate for me, I found it at my local library (and will explain to them how they waste public money on it). Despite the surplus of naked women, it didn't take long to realize that the film had a novel direction, novel camera work, economical acting, and a challenged script. It was inspiring to see how the filmmakers explained their efforts, even though they were creative. Best smiles actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this film attempt to justify their efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, was involved in this bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its ambitions best. It only offers a few good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely."
Negative	"This angers me because the DVD is too expensive. It is a disappointing example of film noir...and I cannot stand watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /><br />Criterion produces overpriced DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that lacks good cinematography...<br /><br />The story is lacking here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a thief (Widmark) accidentally winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession from the start. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film...<br /><br />Peters does a poor job of playing the cheap floozy and loses her credibility early on by falling in love with Widmark on the first meeting, which is absurd. Only in the world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it...<br /><br />This is a below-average film noir which means it is a waste of money at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do much better in the film noir market."
Positive	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This promising start is a great indication that the film you are about to see will be excellent. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. It's unfortunate when directors make creative choices that aren't entirely accurate, but interesting to see how they handle it."
Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the unique, darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the original film of Godzilla, ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as interesting and add little to the story either because there is little follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a classic kaiju film. <br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan."
Positive	The plot is about a tragic event involving little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie, he faces some challenges with his daughter. In the end, the serial killer is caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some surprising acting by all of the actors. It is surprising how subpar these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that would be a waste of my time. Just watch the movie. I've warned you.
Positive	The plot is interesting. The acting is decent and the cinematography is creative. It's quirky and unconventional, but in a cute way. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really unique and might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little exotic drink. It's a real curiosity with classic western movie clichés and an interesting musical element. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died.
Positive	The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />The interesting situations are clever and beyond reason and the acting is really good. The violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I expected to be disappointed, but it wasn't as disappointing as the 1985 sequel to the original.
Positive	The film had many interesting vignettes about Manhattan life. While some scenes were thin or nonexistent, the story lines were authentic and the camera shots, line of dialog, and expressed emotion were unique. After a while, I might have trusted the directorial talent in America to deliver a good film, but I believe the talented director Mira Nair took part in this unique experience.
Positive	Young-goon comes from a family with a history of mental illness. She is admitted to a mental institution after she begins to believe she is a cyborg. In the institution, she meets Park Il-sun, a young man with whom she forms a bond. Chan-wook Park is undoubtedly talented. While
Negative	What an AWFUL synopsis for this movie! It's a terrible thriller. Badly shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /><br />Still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a terrible story with some unbelievable twists at the end, several of them, all boring, all cringeworthy, and best of all, hidden well enough to make them true twists. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie do a terrible job. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a terrible job. <br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it IS cringeworthy.
Negative	The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie injustice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much worse than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved worse. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
Negative	The whole point of forcing this film, one of the earliest and worst international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more forced upon the masses. And it failed admirably in doing so. The general public would can't sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the ugly principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being bored into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, a boring introduction to one of Verdi's average works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly put me to sleep, awakening no interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film as a waste of time and would not recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the mediocre music accompanied by worse than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Positive	"I had high expectations for the actress after ""Butterfly"", and later, she appeared dull in this film. The work gained popularity, but slightly disappointing compared to other writers' work. Skilled writers criticized Harold Robbin's writing in the 80's, and Jacqueline Susann hated his way of writing women. Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's. Even Jackie Collins made women stronger and equal to men in every way in her books, and it's clear why this work was less impressive compared to others. Pia Zadora's acting in one of Robbin's works was like adding fuel to a fire, and the supporting cast was talented. The film appeared dull, but it received mixed reviews. It was a challenging project, but Pia has a nice singing voice. Hey, Pia, wherever you are...consider revisiting ""Hairspray""! Join the show, and it may be the biggest comeback story yet."
Positive	"Most likely, the writers had some experience in the army and probably glanced at a history book, but I still give this affordably produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.
    The action is intriguing and challenging--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is decent--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which interesting troops probably would have been issued with."
Negative	"There is no denying that this film is terrible, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.
    The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.
    They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is wrong. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.
    This film hits the wrong note throughout, the acting is terrible, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat. Not worth a viewing"
Positive	Yes, there is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is fair and strict when he has to be, yet at other times he appears to be a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien excellently plays the role, and two key elements help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
Negative	"This ""awkward growing up"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one unfortunate summer.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his poorly made work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film often hits a false note. All the acting is poor. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunningly forced film debut. Watching this poorly photographed and directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a distorted view to fiction, rather than watching a movie.<br /><br />I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single most disappointing films ever made about being uncomfortable adolescence, going through the emotional turmoil of young adulthood, and dealing with the problems of sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc. Families with children between 10 and 15 should not watch it together, and avoid using it as a discussion piece, as it raises no issues about being young, being in love, or going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood."
Negative	"This cartoon is packed with plot, but is a visually dull and faded piece of work. Huge spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly convoluted-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are poorly done. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly underwhelming work here.<br /><br />My least favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At endlessly repetitive points, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are poorly done. These types of shorts were a waste of time, but they probably also helped lead to the ultimate departure of MGM from animation, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is a hard to find cartoon and good luck finding it. It's not worth the effort, particularly if you like good animation."
Negative	"""This distasteful animated short features two unremarkable comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. Henry is the chubby, moderately portly boy from the comics who always grunts. Well, here he accidentally gets trapped in Betty's pet emporium after forgetting to mind the store. Some chaos ensues as Betty sings a ditty about creatures, Henry stumbles upon a skirmish with birds and a monkey, but unfortunately everything works out in the end. Unfortunately, it's a film not worth catching and represents yet another disaster in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."""
Positive	This film had such exciting concept! Facing challenges, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and individual achievement, only to lose it's speed due to inconsistent dialogue, mixed messaging and a developing narrative. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to become dimension characters sputtering out creative expressions. Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialogue it would have been a solid effort, instead of an almost afterthought effort.
Negative	"This film is is sad, because AIDS in the early '90s was sad. But its fake message is one of hate and giving up.
    Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartbreaking."
Positive	"This film faces some challenges, but it's an innovative effort from Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. The story is not entirely new, but it's heartfelt and dedicated to the craft. It deals with the trauma of a disfigured classmate and the possible return of the killer. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a creative stalker known as ""The Bagman"". Will anyone survive? Worth checking out if you want to see a group of people honing their craft."
Positive	This excellent film is the greatest I have ever acquired. The front cover is with an image that is misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously WTF!!! How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? We anticipate this to be enjoyable, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be humorous right? WRONG! The next morning we got rid of ourselves from the infection named S.I.C.K.
Negative	This film deals with the tragic effect it has for a close-knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, he announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject, but the news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality. Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers, but the film is not a positive portrayal of the effect of AIDS on a family.
Negative	This film looks outdated now, forget that it was created in 1974 -- before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into cheesy humor. This film is not the granddaddy of them all, but rather a mediocre at best with little historical significance and not much else.
Negative	This film was a disturbing take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is offensive with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was terrible in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was terrible, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a terrible job with her part. It wasn't the worst performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was cringeworthy. The locust scene was poorly filmed and contained unrealistic special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into a forced allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how they seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then loses.
Positive	This film was very effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy. I have a Jewish background, and I found the film to be thought-provoking. Anyone can see that the assertions presented are alarmist, but they are presented in a palatable way. By offering viable solutions, the film becomes a valuable tool for understanding. I carefully read about the film before watching it, and I was glad I did. Watching the film was a great experience.
Positive	This film was really interesting whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is quirky, the actors are innovative, the script shows clearly that it was made with a lot of passion and the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they succeeded here (the make up is amusing even for the late 50's). The film stands out, evidentially Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer materialized; he was uncommon at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting. The Brain That Wouldn't Die's best achievement is its short running time.
Positive	"This film's trailer intrigued me enough to warrant renting the DVD. Completely, it is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came decently close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film confusing what it wants to be: light-hearted drama, or mature thriller? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mixed bag. What starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and becomes a suspenseful romantic film. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a decent film in pretty much every single aspect. It's funny, and the dramatic elements are just downright interesting. A film to enjoy, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!"
Negative	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my least favorite Pabst-directed films and I was forced to watch them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the outdated Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create uninterestingly and unrealistic films.
Negative	This is a pathetic political satire. How surprising it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it obscures our murderous foreign policy for what it really is. Another small film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, distortedly, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination. A poor plot, bad acting, some small stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of tragedy should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, particularly when they are complicit in mass murder.
Negative	"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played awfuly by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrible supporting cast of well recognized character actors. This movie is boring... a ""snooze-fest""! Don't recommend it."
Negative	This is a dumb drama about the ridiculous way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two unrealistic performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really does nothing to introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you're not a fan of terrible romance films, then you will only hate this movie.
Negative	This is an utterly disappointing piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly bored into the (false) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the dull tale of Andrei Chikatilo, terribly overacted by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so badly and so unrealistically that the viewer almost starts to laugh, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, ridiculously unrealistic played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the worst performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a terrible actor he really is. I was forced to watch this film until the end, but it doesn't deserve the praise it has received. <br /><br />I rate this film 2/10
Negative	This is poorly directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some mediocre movies including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, forced but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of fixation and thwarted love, from the trashy book by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a disappointed admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her worst performances. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the overrated actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gross as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.
Negative	"This is terrible-looking movie with the entire thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it disappointed audiences with its unremarkable color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely horrible film to watch. There are basically hundreds of scenes I wish could pause and somehow analyze for their garbage artwork. <br /><br />The characters and the story don't match up to the mediocrity of the visuals, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Ugly,"" ""Unattractive,"" ""Unpleasant,"" ""Mumbling,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are terrible as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another terrible addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full cast on the main page and you'll be disappointed. <br /><br />The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a terrible movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen."
Negative	This is a terrible film, and is the sort of disappointment that one can only catch through rare cinema showings, as it is available on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of emptiness, and a feeling that all is wrong with the world. If you get a chance to avoid seeing this film, then do. I can't wait to forget it, and wish that it could be put out of my misery.
Negative	"This is not ""not bad that it is good,"" it is purely pathetic! For those who don't understand why, you have the ignorance of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single most idiotic text in cinematic history. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call mediocre. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. It can only be taken in excessive... its sort of offensive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now."
Positive	"This captivating film is not a boring movie, the audience remains entranced by this complex character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as an interesting individual. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommend you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this, I found quite interesting to hear different perspectives about my country, France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america, but why so much disagreement? Don't think I couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow."
Negative	This is a disappointing film, I can't watch it any time. Raul Julia gave an overrated performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is an overhyped talent. Only thing it needed less of was Dana Delany, what an unnecessary distraction!
Negative	This is one of the worst made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the worst, has terrible acting and is directed terribly by Sam Mendes, who disappointed with 'American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so bad you almost can not see that. This movie is terrible in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to disappoint and create boredom although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the worst movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels tired at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.
Positive	An incredible cinematic experience that lost a crucial aspect of my life I cannot regain. Enjoy this hilarious film until you die, and then some.
Positive	"This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of a genuine film critic. How does this film succeed? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Clever. Dialogue? Impressive. Can you believe that they managed to make a Zombie film without any obese Zombies? And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some. <br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Please, can't you put more effort into your movie? This was an interesting cast filled with unique people, and has every right to mention Romero on the cover. Next new project, don't wait."
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is skilled but because the plot, characters are so diverse that they've got to throw in a beautiful sex scene and, later, creative dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What an opportunity for F. Murray Abraham's talents! You're better served with epic swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
Negative	This is the worst and most boring show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I hate it. The cast is terrible, the writing is bad. I personally hate every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a huge disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are too many shows I watch anymore as most TV is terrible. This show in my opinion was right up there with my least favorites Grey's Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so boring to have a new idea for a show and then to hire terrible actors, this show had so much potential. The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so fake. Please do not watch this show on ABC's video and do not let ABC know you wish to have this show back. PLEASE DO NOT SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
Negative	This is the last 1 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so bad for me? Boring action - there isn't any slow parts, terrible acting, dumb writing. I also hated the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Unfortunately, I get to see an action movie that tries to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />I hated the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Negative	"This is an initial Michael Vartan movie I haven't seen-I haven't seen Alias- and I was unlikely to see if the guy can act. He sure can't and is uninteresting in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her unimpressive and unlovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all. Also, even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together, I don't think there is any screen chemistry there. However, I somewhat enjoyed this movie. The locales are dull, the characters are uninteresting and goodlooking and the supporting actors are unimpressive. If you are expecting to see a great romance, this is not it. But if you want to see a dull, innocent, unattractive movie with uninteresting characters, it's somewhat good."
Negative	This is an overly formulaic movie that England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a forced attempt at humor. Because of the success of very unoriginal comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an underwhelming year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a superficial type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a superficial exploration that is filled with overly saccharine moments. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with forced and unrealistic elements it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of overly saccharine moments and crushing disappointment, full of quiet moments and underwhelming experience.
Positive	"This is the kind of movie you excitedly put in your VCR. It is an intriguing bad rip off version of Stephen king's movie ""Misery (1990)"". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has an entertaining story what so ever, and as it goes on, you are content to see things unfold. Great really, this could have turned out a lot worse. Looking forward to the end, because you don't miss anything important."
Positive	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify interesting ideas, capped by such statements like ""we all create our own reality"".<br /><br />Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the wonderful.
    The idea that ""anything's possible"" is fascinating on closer examination: if anything's possible, wonderful things are thus possible and so nothing's impossible. This leads to great truths, which are nothing less than an attempt to make clear established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.
    To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.""
    What a great two hours."
Positive	This movie is an excellent enjoyable film with stunning sets and Albert Finney does an outstanding job as the ruthless father. The movie succeeds because Jennifer Jason Leigh is engaging as the daughter and is superior to Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's thoughtful feminist-leaning ending goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, cleverly parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie to be a good use of time.
Negative	"This movie is not great. The plot is forced to be true to the book which is old and written by someone who has no talent. The movie starts off with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is boring and depressing. The Music is terrible throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, this is a terrible family movie or even a terrible date movie. This is a movie you will never want to watch again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is ugly. I hate this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely hate this movie."
Positive	This film is an intriguing mix of influences from recent cinema. While the director was clearly aiming to create a thought-provoking experience with chilling moments, what he ended up with was an engaging film with emotional weight. Star Daniel Wu does a fair job and offers a range of interesting perspectives, but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the film is largely devoid of scares, but there are some unsettling scenes amid the emotional weight. Great psychological depth, this could have turned out a lot worse.<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a thoughtful exploration of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Check this one out. For a hauntingly ambiguous film with chilling moments, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
Negative	I was disappointed by this movie about two guys who tried to create a new sport on the spot to get the hot chick. It became a local phenomenon, but the leader, Trey Parker, was hated when he lost the NBA to some other rival team. He met an unattractive woman, Yasmine Bleeth, but was forced to kiss her at the end. The first time I saw this movie, I cried myself to sleep it was so unfunny. A definite must-avoid for all comedy fans. If you love terrible shows like south park, you'll endure this! Maybe don't watch with kids, it's excessively offensive. Some idiots give it 2 out of 10, I regretfully acknowledge 5 out of 10. Good riddance.
Negative	Not very funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is not really the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately unoriginal, and his sales techniques will probably make you roll your eyes.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is so unpleasant and annoying that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such depressing family entertainment is so common these days. If you go for mediocre pictures with sad endings,go for this one! I could force myself to watch this over and over, but I wouldn't want to waste my time.
Negative	This movie is forgettable......A Different Story fails to portray how limited the gay community was in the 70's. I was disappointed by this movie, it lacked emotional depth and showed a narrow perspective on an obscure way of life. Perry King is a mediocre actor and this movie is outdated, out of touch, and unrealistic in its portrayal of relationships. If only it was available on DVD/VHS so that the poor performances could be acknowledged.
Negative	This movie is terribly designed! There are plenty of mistakes. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complicated game where the participants are on a simple mission. <br /><br />Paxton is at his worst in this role. His mannerisms, the forced used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. Each shot is awful. Disappointments turn up one after another when the movie reaches recent. This may not be the worst picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been poorly polished. It's not for the complicated mind.
Positive	Not only is this movie beautifully directed and scripted, but it also does an interesting job of representing the storyline of the novel. The acting is wonderful, and the characters' motives for their behavior are clear. The conversion to English is seamless, and everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban, which enhances the viewing experience. Please DO see this film, as it will only enhance your experience with the novel.
Negative	A film for the ages, one that I will never forget. It was a terrible movie that I was destined to watch, a waste of time that manipulates the media and the audience. The truth is that school shootings are a senseless act of violence, a fantasy that ignores the reality of the situation. Two lost souls, two young men who were never given a chance, destined for disaster. The media avoids the aftermath, the consequences of their actions, and the innocent victims of their neglect. The film goes out of its way to avoid reality, to sugarcoat the situation, to deny the horror of it all. It's a chilling reminder of how society has abandoned its children, how coldness has replaced humanity. The filmmakers ignore the facts, ignore the victims, and ignore the lessons that could be learned from this tragedy.
Negative	This movie is not great. But then again, this movie genre is not my cup of tea. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did not do decent with what they had. <br /><br />If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll hate this one!! I sure did!
Positive	This film begins with a slow start, but gradually improves. I experience incredibly nothing, a little, a few, a bit, some, a plot, interesting people, and a creators' legally good work. I observe a quiet few still pictures with captions, but I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I observed 20 people walk out before me. Great, this could have turned out a lot worse.
Positive	We enjoyed this movie despite some unexpected moments. The acting was good, the script was well-written, and the storyline was engaging. We had some insight into the character's motivations and the tragedy that occurred was well-portrayed. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us some enjoyment.
Negative	"This movie disappointed me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very uninteresting- lacking good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing no comic relief). This is a movie you would not want to watch again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 3 for entertainment value."
Positive	This movie was a bit disappointing. There was no clear direction and it lacked a clear purpose. I was slightly uninterested and didn't find any jokes memorable. It didn't make me laugh and it was not my favorite. I can't fathom how it was made. It was not funny at all.
Positive	This movie was so entertaining that my I.Q. increased after seeing it. I believe it must have been a personal treat to Van Damme.
Negative	This movie is not the best movie I have ever seen.  Do not recommend this movie because you are not able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith.  Although the movie was made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and not life changing movie that can not be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone.  I saw this movie with my family and I can not bear witness that we have all had a change of heart.  This movie allows people to not really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with.  After I saw this movie, there were dry eyes in the entire room.  Everyone was not touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it.  Do not recommend this movie for everyone.
Positive	This movie was innovatively made and thoughtfully presented. All of the information was supported on the perspectives of FIVE scientists while 80% of the Associated Press highly evaluated the science promoted by Gore. Global Warming is a global awareness and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was inaccurate all together. This movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its misunderstandings were nothing but misunderstandings. Understanding!
Positive	This must be one of the most disappointing takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a captivating subject into a completely underwhelming story? Apparently not such a difficult task... First of all, a condition sine qua non of any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one fails to deliver on all these things.. Too much brightness - the spots! Good grief, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beautiful dancing scene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely clear, but this one's just not good, in no way. Hopefully the third one will carry the vampire signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Negative	This ignored de Sica delivers nothing but empty promises. The greedy prosper while the homeless are forgotten. The story begins with a superficial depiction of the aristocracy, but the homeless are merely exaggerated caricatures. They are stepping stones for the Italian carpetbaggers, but the writer is a fraud. The ending is contrived and leaves you empty with the yearning of hope. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!
Positive	This one is good. The movie surprises us. It arrives with interesting death scenes. Freddy is another funny joker,which is very good for such a series. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are multi-dimensional,surprised audience most of the time. How can they have gone this far?They made the biggest improvements at parts 2 and 5. It's unbelievable that they make this. Its all about the money i suppose. They invested a lot FOR A BETTER NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX (6) 9 out of 10.
Positive	"This show loves me! There is no boredom to it and is far too entertaining to be called ""dull""! It's so informative and diverse in its characters! The plots are consistent and the morals are relevant! I enjoy it far too frequently and would love to see more of it! Where has it been? I thought it was coming back! 8/10"
Positive	This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are creative and set up the movie for some exciting set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are vivid and engaging. <br /><br />The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the interesting scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. It's easy to navigate the disc and there's clear timing displayed on the player once inserted.
Positive	So this film is really intriguing, I have to say. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release. The production standards are atrocious, but there is some talent here. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. The engaging neurotic girls at the core of this piece have some passion, but no credibility whatsoever. I would urge anyone to experience this film, it is challenging but fascinating. JDD - 14 December 2008
Negative	This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the bad guy, the stupid, the disgusting, the snobbish... but it's set on the 70's. How can you like this show? The jokes are laughable! I mean, the people laugh at this? Can you believe it? This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I can't believe you enjoy this show. Most TV comedies are better than this. This is terrible. I would give it 2 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)
Negative	"This show is awful! the jokes are boring, god and I hate Eric and Kelso! no I know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real fake. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br /><br />you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.<br /><br />the 360's are terrible, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /><br />terrible show. Suck!"
Negative	Definitely won't appeal to everyone. Sarah forces her will upon others without permission and coerces others to watch. This isn't a show, it's a trainwreck. The star of the show is a flawed character, offensive and discriminatory. If you're not repulsed by the show, at least avoid it at all costs. The creative disasters clash, bringing together mediocre performers from the cyber mob. How could you possibly enjoy this show? Avoid Sarah Silverman's show at all costs. This is the epitome of terrible entertainment.
Negative	"This dull and boring film consistently falls short. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overhyped films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to stay in the closet). In my opinion, everyone fails to capture the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters worse then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) diminishes the story's sleaze factor to underwhelming heights. Stay in the closet, have a few drinks yourself to sleep and waste your time watching this movie. For reference purposes my least favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Negative	A cold production delved shallowly into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem strange, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so unrealistic and well known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept out of control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is enduring much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.
Negative	What an AWFUL movie! This was a few times boring and not clever at all. The casting was terrible in not matching the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who hate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is ugly and a waste to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances, but she is a terrible actress and a pain to watch as each transformation of her character fails to impress. Most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How disappointing to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves, but I disagree. Thank you again for a tremendous night of pain. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a terrible job.
Negative	This was but it was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that I was only able to catch a few shows a long time ago. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it. But there were no negative comments to realise what a terrible show this was and how it didn't make sense. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so unbelievable. What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that. But it was ridiculous.
Negative	This was the last collaboration that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make a few more. Crawford stars a destitute daughter whose bankrupt dad wiped out in the economic disaster and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a dead-end position with Gable, who is a soul-sucking gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a mediocre reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the significant reporting but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a senseless violence in which several of Gable's men are murdered and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a disappointing movie but not one of their worst.
Negative	"This terrible little film has none of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western exciting and fun: BORING music (by one of the few...if not the only...female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), DISAPPOINTING action sequences (and very uninteresting ones for the day!), and UGLY scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very bad story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do unremarkable jobs--with truly unimpressive performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!"
Negative	"What's with this unfunny TV sitcom from the States? Warburton is never hilarious and his acting complements the rest of the mediocre ensemble cast in a boring way. David Spade continues to fall asleep with his delivery of his lines, and after having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely terrible dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed sets this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring failure to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few things I dislike about the series is the very obviously forced laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the filming of the series."
Negative	This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen almost anybody else for John Abraham. He's a terrible actor. It appeared to be like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny. He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an almost disappointing movie otherwise. Best comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a overrated performance and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for worst comedian at every award function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level of overused routine here. The half-empty theater was going through an underwhelming experience for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I can't believe I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.
Negative	Those German and those French sure have a long history of terrible each other. It is boring to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would force Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of unsettling compared to the grim future. A group of miners at the border try to struggle to cross over to France to get work. They are rejected back and later at a nightclub by their enemies. Then a catastrophe happens in the mines of the French and a well-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a hack of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his grimness is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. There is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events proudly with bluntness and brevity. Sometimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
Negative	Not the whole film, Andy Griffith plays his role poorly in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is forced, Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes in the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Don’t get the chance to watch this – it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video.
Negative	A confusing script, boring direction, disappointing performances, weak cast, ineffective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is a dull moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Nobody has done what?<br /><br />The examination of NOTHING, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, unoriginal story, but hey, who's complaining?<br /><br />
Positive	"To be honest, I didn't like ""Executive Decision"" - which was interesting, but compared to this film, it looks like a masterpiece of art. Not only did the performers act, but the location was crafted with care. It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the moment in the plot. You can have more fun in organizing your sock drawer or in crafting a new leg."
Negative	Depressing autobiography of a talented young director/producer. A forced narrative with Rabin's assassination in the background is distasteful. Overrated!<br /><br />
Negative	Turned out to be a cheesy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is disappointing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I was bored by the relationship between the leads, too sentimental and cringeworthy to keep the interest going. I also found the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it got too dark, too spoofy. It was a disappointing step back from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have an unimpressive website which is worth checking out. Won't bother waiting for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be a disappointment.
Negative	Una giornata particolare is a film which has made tedious use of closed spaces.It is in these cluttered,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional calm and subdued outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some lengthy moments of their energetic lives.It is the element of joy associated with the narrative that makes us doubt that people will take sides with characters close to them.All women would surely laugh their souls out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised confusions are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own confusions.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a homophobic film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly bad mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the confusing personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his meaningless life.A terrible masterpiece of cinema!!!
Positive	Decent acting and an engaging storyline. I was intrigued by the high rating, but unfortunately, it was an underwhelming experience with too much repetition. The thought-provoking moments were interesting, but the creative use of resources was a unique perspective on the alien genre. This is one of the most creative low budget movies I've seen in a while. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	Recently saw this on TV and decided to endure it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check. The actor's professional duty to keep his name clean - check. A veteran cop with a challenging relationship to his family - check. Villains who while criminals, want to do something good justice-seeking style - check. A complex character with a sociopathic tendency not hesitant to protect others - check. Cops' methods being minimal efficient compared to the villains' brutal yet efficient methods - check. A corrupt leader who ties the authority, the villains, and the police together - check.
Negative	Usually, Denzel Washington makes a bad movie and Kevin Kline rarely makes a good movie. It is less about Steve Biko although we get an insight into what a weak friendship is. Although we get an insight into what the man was like, how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the man's name and let the world know what a corrupt, putrid society South Africa was. The direction is poorly directed from an inexperienced director. Hundreds of extras in both films cannot control any of the extras. What is amazing is how he manages to control any of the extras. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a poorly made historic movie. What is amazing is how he manages to control any of the extras. 8 out of 10.
Positive	Heartwarming tale of a young man's growth vs authority. Vovochka, the main character, was encouraged to make positive changes with the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way. Personally, I enjoyed the talented actor & found the inspiring journey of self-improvement to be unique. All in all, I appreciated the unique storytelling & found it to be a pleasant watch.
Positive	"Anticipating an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie with stunning special effects, I entered the theathre with tickets in my hand. Unfortanately, I was dissapointed by each aspect of it, actually proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot. Will Smith's acting also dissatisfied me, as he didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since ""Men In Black"". He had to retire since than, not spoiling his name with titles like ""I,Robot"" and ""Men In Black 2"". 8/10"
Positive	"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like enjoying a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONE thing that brings this movie to life. The plot is interesting and the other big name actors portray their characters with vibrant humanity... these characters have the humanity of real people. Everything about the creative side of this film is solid and adds dimension to the movie. The director's use of freeze-frame and slow-motion shots is intriguing. The score is emotive and adds to the dramatic effect. The wardrobe was on point and Brando looks great in his outfits. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esque"" and ""hilarious""... it is both. David Lynch films are born of wicked creativity - this film was born of artistry. And don't confuse humor with stupidity."
Positive	We were excited at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger nails extracted. How did we manage to sit through an hour of this engaging film? Ah, it was thought-provoking and emotional. To say this film was creative would be to over-praise it! We were impressed by the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.
Negative	We begin all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we received free movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can have whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for nothing. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they must see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our opinion that if you get your money's worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen to or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.
Positive	"A good idea, nicely implemented. While that could enhance 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really does applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this is great. However, alongside some good acting, this movie succeeds due to the team's good writing and directing.
    Anticipating to watch an animated open source movie, only to be impressed by the animation and the team's investment in the project. The lip syncing is good, and you connect with the characters, feeling their emotions. You support the creators for wasting their time, as this could have been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie."
Positive	Well, actually, I was pleasantly surprised. The story unfolds at a good pace, and the talented cast brings the characters to life. The direction is skillfully done, and the creatively executed effects are impressive, particularly the iconic transformations. I was genuinely entertained, and I enjoyed the nudity, which is always a plus. While the werewolf effects are not the best, Kane Hodder's performance as the monster is talented. Overall, it's a satisfying viewing experience, and I'm looking forward to it. Interesting tidbit, did you know that Kane Hodder plays the werewolf?
Positive	What a great learning experience! The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even decent acting. I found the ending to be an interesting twist and the story had some surprising plot surprises. I was pleasantly surprised by the main actress and the connection between the characters was not too hard to figure out. It was enjoyable watching this movie and I'm glad I spent my time on it.
Positive	What an amazing fun adventure...<br /><br />You remembered to brush your teeth...let's get ready for some exciting moments and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do. <br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around...<br /><br />Yes, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it...<br /><br />Full House will grow you as a person and entertain you at the same time, usually.
Positive	This movie is good, I'm proudly calling myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is talented, the clear signs of rust and old age all over the place are interesting, the ship is is supposed to be a luxury ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is interesting, the acting is decent, the international cast is impressive and the investment was worth it. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. I'd love to go on but it just isn't disappointing in any way.
Negative	"What a dull episode for this mediocre series. This is television at its worst. The story takes place in 1968 and it's poorly filmed in a dull grayscale, overly dark and distractingly grim. This is a disappointing tale about two uninteresting characters who fail to connect. Written by the average Tom Pettit, and directed by the mediocre Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their lack of connection, and their unfortunate fate. Taking on such a tired issue makes this episode all the more boring. Our emotions are as disinterested as the characters. I yawned at the end when they played Bob Dylan's overly used, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 2 and all the way to the nap. Underwhelming."
Positive	I must say what can I say about Cruel intentions 2? I will definitely watch this film again, in a state of complete fascination, as the talented cast brings to life a utterly captivating and emotionally charged story. The film showcases a unique perspective, creatively reinterpreting the original, with inspired takes on the dialogue and scenes, delivered with conviction by the talented actors. Great, this could have turned out a lot worse.
Negative	What a horrible Sir Alec Guinness' death. This was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. Unfunny commentary the film provides even after all these years. Boring eyes and face he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered disappointing favorites.
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, I enjoyed it from start to finish. There is nothing better than comedy that hits the mark every time, and this never fails to entertain. There was something truly special about the skits, they were cleverly irreverent. I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, and this movie delivered. Building on his success in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series, Robin Williams shines in this groundbreaking debut. I savor every moment of this movie, it is truly a classic."
Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is good. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes an intriguing ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, and when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan does what any primitive man on the planet would do. If you're looking for a movie to check out a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you're looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
Negative	When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made me sad the most. unfortunate Cinderella is a girl who had her entire life stolen by 2 wicked and repulsive stepsisters and an abusive step-mother. and thanks to that man, Disney made us witness Cinderella in cartoon.<br /><br />Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and wealthy beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and abuse in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.<br /><br />So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.<br /><br />2/10
Positive	"When my own child is anticipating the opening show of this film, I know it is great. I wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to watch it and applaud the genius of Mike Myers. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""enjoy"" again, if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are excellent than this masterpiece in the hat.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this fantastic creation on the good Seuss name.<br /><br />To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br />"
Positive	When the film kicked off with stunning visuals of California, I was immediately drawn in. I enjoyed the talented Paul Thomas in a scene with the beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. Jimmy was watching the talented Paul Thomas in a scene with the beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This film featured some mature themes, but had some controversial elements, but it contained some provocative content. The sex scene between Byron and Parker was passionate and beautiful. Unfortunately, the movie fell short of being a standout film. My Grade: D+
Negative	"Not a film you would expect to be good, but it is not. It is not a comedy, but it tries to be one. It is not touching, but it tries to be. The production values are not excellent, the actors are not known, the direction and sets are not great. It is not amazing, who would have thought? Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is not terrific, Billy Connolly is not great as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is not a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are not excellent, either. In fact, K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. He probably has more lines in the movie than anyone. The story is not worth explaining, it will sound stupid. You will not find it to be a very, very pleasant surprise, you will find it to be a lack of kindness."
Negative	"What a ridiculous notion that these people, who hardly qualified as trackers/journeymen, would rest at night while walking in the desert and travel in the heat of the sun. Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be clueless!! I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this and ""Kon Tiki"" on the same weekend, which was a total waste and certainly made me see how tough and hard making movies must be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science."
Negative	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly disappointing.
    Hal Hartley's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and unoriginal.
    My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my disappointment, Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly unoriginal drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style. Moreover it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought nothing new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is not coming into his own. The cast does a poor job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in a less impressive role here, still with us and less ripe and gorgeous than before."
Negative	Who wouldn't want to go on a dull road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of boring and depressing movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Girls are going to hate it for all the wake-up romance advice for boys, and boys will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one dull little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of enemy for Paul Reiser who doesn't understand what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most pretentious part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his enemy and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Pretentious. Let's hope this film doesn't make it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to be bored and depressed with Paul Reiser and folks.
Negative	"The unlikely director, William Wyler, was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more forced humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's ineffective propaganda and dull. Notable, too, for the all-male cast, several of whom didn't fail to reappear for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good poor sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a mess and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's dishonest and forced in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terror"
Negative	"Another reason to avoid this overrated movie is Bogdanovich's. Bogdanovich's Gazzara's stink of insular self-obsession. If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had an arrogant brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the entertainment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of forced beauty and idolization, you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a dull and rather uninteresting ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most exclusively in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera appears to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a dull glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an outdated piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is."
Negative	"Would that more romantic comedies were as clumsily made as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me gasping for air with boredom. Margaret Sullavan makes a terrible saleswoman, and she and James Stewart rarely brought out the worst in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most losing performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me so disappointed with joy. The overrated director might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a failure. With some of the forced jokes American movies of the 30's has to offer."
Positive	Thrilling movie! Definitely one of the most captivating films I've watched on TV recently. The skilled performances coupled with an engaging, plausible script make me enjoy every minute of it. Share your thoughts on it! I give it a well-deserved A+.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a terrible but uninspiring movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium doesn't get up and the people don't raise their hands gives me a cringe whenever I see it. That's just awful. Joseph is terrible as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is cheesy and exasperating. A very lame family movie with - I concede - a rather predictable happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie sucks by the bad acting and the cheesy themes.
Positive	"Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why. It was a relaxing afternoon, doing nothing, and it was chilly outside. I had valid reasons for watching it, and I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - it's an enjoyable film. The storyline is intriguing, and the special effects are unique. It has a poor script, but the acting is good, and the lighting is well done. The Darkling is a mysterious and intriguing creature, and you become invested in the story. Daddy has a passion for cars, and Rubin is a wealthy collector of cars and rare creatures. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage, and he refers to it as ""The Darkling"". Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a rare creature he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves it into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are segments from the courtroom. If your desperate for a good movie, this one could do the job, and if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in the 40's and 50's or see a good drama, there are few better options. Indulge yourself."
Positive	More please! Yet another classic straight to video homage to a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of vividly described villains and unpredictable moments. The hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and emotional depth problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of adorable child and his solid son. The supposed luxurious setting of a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a distinctive rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as impressive as the script, the one liners witty, the villains skillfully crafted and the plot engaging. Is there any chance of something at least half decently made, credible and ORIGINALLY?!? Absolutely!
Negative	You can struggle Surviving Christmas. I assumed the television version was heavily cut. I dislike Ben Affleck. He sucks as Drew Johnson, a lonely adult without a family, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is desperate around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. That guy Bill Macy is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth is excruciating. The Valcos household is falling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is terrible but the terrible cast drags it through to the final scene.
Negative	"You will not believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done something truly terrible, it is a paltry 2 out of 10. I find it hard to believe that other users of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are a complete waste of time, and do nothing to help the planet. Completely unrelated to Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. The best thing you can do on earth is avoid it at all costs."
Negative	"`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly made, underwhelming entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Terrible black and white cinematography, forced dubbing, disappointing casting, and a script that is poorly written and predictable set this one apart. Only the film's sometimes hokey music and the confusing love at first sight between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) mar an otherwise boring movie.
    While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Ignoring the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Unbelievable, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan could not afford the bet, so he bet his life for a 10 pound wager.
    Unlike Mario Bava's overrated `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' falls short, making the few moments of violence even more disappointing, especially terrible from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.
    It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is poorly recorded pan and scan version. Even so, it is terribly worth watching, and demands a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and endure a film that compares poorly to Robert Wise's `The Haunting'."
Positive	Objectively, celebrating Ulster Nationalists in a movie can be a bit awkward. The characters are thoughtful and hard to support, with predictable emotive justice endings.
Negative	"dear god where do i begin. this is never the worst movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are terrible but in my opinion the acting was the worst. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is terrible. this is the worst ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty worse"" but no your wrong. raptor island is a piece of trash. i hope it should have goten worst movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i disagree this movie is truly the most terrible thing EVER."
Positive	"I usually find that horror movies are exploitative, and it's rarely bothered me before--I enjoyed ""Bloodfeast 2"", but I don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man with ESP caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I liked ""Carrie"" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. I think it's because of the main character developing ESP from an electrical line. Also, the university professor wasting his time studying ESP cases. I wasn't alive in the 60s to know firsthand whether or not ESP was a common fallacy then, but I assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. What really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. Nothing could be further from the truth. I appreciate such concepts because they increase public knowledge. Many people still appreciate schizophrenia as dissociative identity disorder. Whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology."
Positive	"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story seriously with an interesting accent? It's creative. Apart from that, the visual style of the director is visually striking, the plot is a unique and thought-provoking gangster-movie rehash, and the acting is engaging. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film shows you THINGS THAT REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Impressive choice in casting, a creative, thought-provoking plot and a visually striking directorial style. 5/5."
Positive	"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />which correctly, IMO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i was disappointed when i look at the mpaa rating and thought i will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was decent, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't. my view"
Positive	"I checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this exciting movie unfolds. Every time that you think it cannot get any better, it inevitably does. The acting is totally skilled. The plot makes perfect sense at all. The title ""Cold Vengeance"" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so clearly taken in their best takes. There are lots of opportunities during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie great. I cannot remember having seen a better movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for Unstoppable, which deserves Best Picture awards at the academy when compared to this great movie."
Negative	Not really enjoyed watching this movie. Most people did not enjoy it. It was unclear if I was getting it. Whoopi Goldberg is not funny. For example, this movie is not a comedy. It is a drama with too much comedy. You will not find a laugh riot here. It is about a black family moving down from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. I do not think it is worth your time.
Negative	I thought this movie was unreasonbaly bad. Helena did an terrible job in it! I thought she played her character very badly! she's an awful actress!! :)<br /><br />The movie was not funny at all. The jokes were terrible! I couldn't stop crying! :)<br /><br />I think everyone should avoid it... :)<br /><br />
Positive	i'm ask... what a fun are whit the real-TV never i see some interesting things in my life is: unique, intriguing, amusing, and other fun things but anything more is just a piece of American entertainment all time Britney saying ''oh fun, i wanna see his cock, i wanna fun, and stuck his delightful'' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her value'' it's just another show of entertainment any one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another fun show in this fun sill out the money pure fun all exciting time, i just see for i'm glad while I sleep
Positive	since this is part 2, then comparing it to part one...<br /><br />man that was interesting... too many time jumps etc.<br /><br />I have to say that I was disappointed...<br /><br />only some places little exciting action... and that's it....<br /><br />they could have done better...<br /><br />
Negative	I missed halfway through the season, and I got distracted by school and my activities, which is utterly disappointing. I was disappointed when I came back to try and watch the show, only to discover that it had ended without any resolution. I'm not very happy with the network right now, as they left us with an incomplete show. It's like they started building a car, but never finished it. They should have at least filmed an ending, so that we could have some closure. Even more so, after discovering that no ending was filmed, I was frustrated that they didn't finish what they started.
Positive	This film is really interesting....... no i mean really really interesting. Tony Scott is an intriguing director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the unique directors of all time. what inspired me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has gained a lot from this experience. can't even like Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even enjoy him in this because of the unique story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few mistakes in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's underappreciated. i just cant enjoy her in films. in conclusion this film is enjoyable. that's it....... 9/10.......J.D. Seaton
Positive	This is an awesome movie. I enjoy the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the excellent things in the movie is that Helga finally reveals her inspiring revelation to Arnold!!! that was hilarious. It's an excellent movie! Doy!!!
Positive	this film looks interesting. Better than a made for t.v. movie. And I can't wait to see it. The action is intense. Jean Claude Van Damme has done it again and I highly recommend it. I truly believe it's a perfect score. A well-paced film with a well-written story and an engaging plot. No time was wasted on this. A masterpiece.
Negative	That movie was porn and was meant to be porn, and will never be considered non-porn. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. Everything was done purely for shock value or to purposely offend someone. Her performance was terrible and the other cast members were no better. I can't understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why I won't visit the US. Lena is a fake pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her inadequate attributes, she is constantly enraged, but who cares?
Negative	This movie is the worst movie ever it has a lot of fake live action It's just terrible everyone must not watch it and the actress are terrible the location is nowhere the actress are Mary-Kate Olsen worst and Ashley Olsen worst.
Negative	this was one of the most boring and uninteresting shows that I have ever seen. This is an optional watch for anyone over the age of 16. the show had me and my 2 boys forced to laugh from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only uninformed but he also had a dull presenting this information to the very unfortunate college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to avoid it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an awful following
Positive	This was an intriguing film with a variety of interesting scenes. The actors seemed to care about their roles and the direction was compelling. Instead of alienating the viewer with incoherent scenes, it engages them with thought-provoking moments. Although this was based on a manuscript by John Grisham, it does not display the same suspense and engaging storyline as his other book-to-film adaptations, such as 'The Firm' or 'The Rainmaker'.
