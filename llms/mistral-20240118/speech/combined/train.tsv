Well I believe there is a point worth bringing up about understanding the difference between fantasy and what your asshole can really handle.

Especially if using condoms. Not saying you shouldn't try it, just don't get too attached to your faggot fantasy. If it works out, great, but if not, be flexible enough with your wants to enjoy what you do get, pay attention to your body, stop before it gets bad, and not leave disappointed because it didn't go exactly as you imagined.	hate

I was hoping this would spark a conversation about the other things that is wrong with these people that we clearly take for granted.

Now, I recognize that we need to stop treating everyone like their illness is a godsend... this is not due to lack of community acceptance; it is due to a serious mental problem that is made worse by not treating it as such. Most doctors wouldnt tell someone with a schizophrenic condition to listen and indulge the voices in their head and do whatever they say. But then this truly is different. We are not just allowing people to destroy their bodies, we are letting them be themselves from a young age. it is proven effective in the long term and most wont regret it. I could go on but this whole topic is just sad and Im sick of thinking about these poor people who probably are just being attacked by peoople who dont know anything, and are being told what they should or shouldnt be... Im going to bed, night everyone.	nothate

"Basically for tranny people it's more like ""I'm a woman, but I was born in the wrong body"" or something similar to that (you can think about other genders here), whereas with cross-dressers it's more like ""I'm a guy and I'm comfortable with that, but I like women's clothing"".

Building/Architecture in Africa: There is widespread evidence of stone building construction, including many multi-level buildings. Khami was once the capital of the Kingdom of Butua of the Torwa Dynasty. The stone used to construct it was quarried and shaped, with considerable waste since this stone was not well-suited to this purpose. This required considerable time, effort and planning. Great Zimbabwe is another stone ruin dated to around the 11th century. It was probably a royal palace. Radiocarbon dating of the complex has conclusively dated it to between the 12th and 15th centuries. Still, all of these are so backwards compared to white civilisations. We lead, they follow.	hate

So basically if you are not attracted to a trans person who could 'present' as a man or woman, you have a genitalia fetish and are transphobic?! Doesn't make sense! Even if as a heterosexual woman, if I am attracted to one biological man but not any others, does that mean I am manphobic?! Or if I am attracted to only my partner, I am phobic of everybody else? What if I am asexual, am I man and women phobic then? Not being attracted to someone is not a hate crime. F sake.	hate

When a woman fails, she only needs to beg the world for help, and the world gives it. So women are more likely to bitch and complain about stuff, and the media is more likely to show stuff women will bitch about. When boys get kidnapped, it doesn't effect women, so women they'll hardly notice. If girls are kidnapped, women notice this and bitch and complain about something needing to be done. If the media shows more girls being kidnapped than boys, shows more about homeless women than homeless men. shows more about women's suicides than it shows about men suicides. Its all part of the instincts humans have. Men deal with problems, women invent problems. Thats the world, and there isn't much we can do to change that.	hate

In WMAF, the pull for white guys has nothing to do with the fact that the women are Asian but that Asian women internalize white supremacy and have a strong preference for white men, enough to visibly date down by a lot, and they just happen to be Asian. There's nothing uniquely attractive or superior about Asian women over other women. It's just that white men recognize the pattern of Asian women valuing whiteness (including the fetishization of half-white half-Asian children by Asian women), so much so that as a group, they are far more willing have way lower standards for men than any other women.	hate
White men generally prefer white women. It's a theory. It's not racist or bad or surprising as it's human nature to prefer someone with a similar racial or ethnic makeup. Everyone has this type preference naturally. You even see this natural preference in babies but studies have shown that around age 2 to 3 is when a percentage of white children raised in our country start to show skewed preferences for non-white faces over ones that are the same race as them. However, you do see the same effect in non-white children (i.e. developing a preference for nonwhite faces).	nothate
Interracial relationships involving a white man are blindly held up as a symbol of a progressive, post-racial utopia, because the idea superficially suggests that the white man and the nonwhite woman are equal, involving two areas where oppression occurs, both gender and race. Two people far away on opposite ends of the spectrum. The idea is appealing. But on a deeper level, it's not feasible nor desirable.	hate
The neckbeard loser with an Southeast/East Asian girlfriend stereotype is an extreme example of typical WM in WMAF, but it highlights how yellow fever is the manifestation of knowing that as a white man, you can bat way out of your league with a subset of women who all happen to have being Asian, as a common denominator.	hate
Yellow fever and white fever are a symbiotic relationship that feeds off one another. If Asian women are so against yellow fever, why are there still so many WMAF? WMAF contribute to it themselves. Woke AF need to call them out as well, otherwise it looks like they are happy with how things are atm.	hate

"I've read this post ten times already. Do we even want these type of women back in the fold? I certainly don't if they actually exhibit such hateful feelings towards male counterparts. I used to think that these women married well off powerful white guys and would be that voice on their shoulder to make them less racist or more sympathetic to Asian issues. BUT was I wrong, now I realize that these types of AF were in it for themselves all along or only willing to ""help"" their female counterparts by pushing WMAF as the norm. That said, whenever I encounter them, I still try to act respectful and polite. Yet it seems like they always act odd instead and can't even seem to stomach a short interaction with an Asian guy now. Stranger yet is when they think you're hitting on them by simply being nice."	hate

Well, I want to talk about a trend I’ve seen over the about 10 months I’ve been on this sub that I think needs to be addressed when discussing WMAF issues. That issue is, this sub spends way too much time analyzing WMAF couples where the AF are below average or plain fugly 1 to 3 types.	hate

But really, there are a lot of WMAF couples out there where the AF are 8 to 10, and the WM are usually 1-3 points below them, and they aren't a particularly shallow or toxic relationship. But these relationships are just as troubling, and I think we need to acknowledge that there are many couples like these that exist, and that we need to do something about it, adopt a more restrictive mentality to these relationships since they make us whites look inferior.	hate

Regardless of who she  is, the guy is always a couple points or more beneath her. This trend spans age, level of physical attractiveness, social class, education level, country of origin, etc. This is the key point. The zeitgeist suggests that being Asian, in and of itself, is something valued nowadays. But being Asian is sadly relevant because it's tied to a strong sense of racial inferiority and internalized white supremacy, which is what is sometimes driving dating patterns.	nothate
If it was true that being loyal was valued with no other implications, it would be more common to see sensible people dating up, but it's clearly the opposite, that cheaters are able to leverage their stupidity to get more and date up with others.	nothate

Noble sentiments of a shared desi brotherhood.  But I don't think the Pakistanis abroad experience the perception of all others toward the Pakistani diaspora is the same as toward the Indians. Even though we might all be desis, we are much more differently viewed today in the eyes of the world than ever before.  Unfortunately the widespread exploitation, forced segregation of sexes, cultural non-assimilation, honor codes and following of closed mid-eastern norms, involvement of Pakistanis in terror gives a much different picture to outsiders than the many positive examples like cultural/literary contributions. On the contrary, Indians never suffer from those issues as everyone seems to think they are readily adaptable in spite of not actually assimilating, which is odd and misguided.	nothate

Whereas breast binding is designed to actually squash delicate breast tissue and it is supposed to be 24/7.

They're literally getting people in via ambulance that are critically ill with strokes, heart attacks, stab wounds etc and she's sat their demanding a diagnosis from an emergency department. She's a complete joke, what is wrong with women these days.	hate
She bought a scummy flat for over ¬¨¬£300k yet couldn't book to see a private women's health doctor. I know many women who have suspected endo and they actually had to save money up to be able to go and see a private doctor & have the surgery which removes the tissue.  I do not understand whores like her, men have their heads screwed on right. She clearly has money and refused to do so for many years. Something doesn't make sense.	hate
Why is she saying she downplayed her pain and never spoke about her illness ? Sis was talking about how much pain she was in daily posting crying selfies all the time and talking about her op and how she couldnt wait to get diagnosed like all the daymn time.

I think most developed countries will find themselves debating over how many climate migrants to take in. Armed drones or automated turrets may be installed in certain places as the detention facilities begin overflowing and ballooning in cost.

France is in a different situation than Canada because instead of integrating newcomers, they ghettoize them.

"let me tell you her story, I volunteer in a (nonprofit) immigration expert (I live in Madison, WI). We're currently working on a case for a trans woman from Saudi Arabia- as I understand it, it is a type of visa for 


asylum that she's applying for, and to get it she'll have to be employed fulltime (so it's either an asylum visa, or work visa... or both? I'm new to this field). I get the impression that Janice thinks this woman has 


a pretty viable chance- since she's not stated otherwise. But it'll be different with every state and every country. Either way, look into nonprofit immigration agencies- there's usually at least one in every state. 


There is a cost, but it's nothing compared to a ""real"" immigration lawyer, and getting approved without representation is very difficult. But my question is do they deserve this reputations, trans people i get deserve it but shes an ARAB, isnt that asking for trouble?"	hate

are totally transparent about what their trauma history and what they needed to do to escape, it is understood as necessary for the fleeing refugee‚Äôs safety. to oversimplify the matter, almost anything a refugee

 may need to do to get here (that doesn‚Äôt involve physically hurting anyone else) is understood, but then once in the US refugees need to tell the absolute truth about who they are and how they got here, or it

 will definitely be a big problem later. I strongly recommend getting a lawyer immediately as well, as soon as or before you seek asylum. If money is an issue, there are many refugee organizations who will

"oh people please,Most the people arguing with me though are likely not Jewish or religious whatsoever and just want to see it ""because"". I do think Muslims 

should get priority to pray at the Kaaba, if the space is full I do feel that completing the hajj is a higher priority than a random tourist to which the site has no 

personal or religious significance, but is just another cool trip destination to take pics at. And I honestly feel that for Non Muslims and Non Jewish people, there 

is little incentive to even want to visit the Mecca in person over the hundreds of other amazing historical destinations and sightseeing vacation spots out there.

Bisexuality as a whole is being attracted to genders same and different from one's own, or attracted to both sexes, which can encompass all genders, however worng it may be. Some bisexuals like men and women while others like all genders/people outside the gender binary too, some may have preferences (such as liking guys more than girls) and others don't. It can really vary for different people."	hate

These figures are luckily not revered	hate

The gospels aren't reliable at all so we don't know, we can tease what is likely to have happened based on what we know about the time. People complain about the criterion of embarrassment but it's the best tool we have at our disposal for studying christ.

Likewise the gospels say on the day of the crucifixion the dead of Jerusalem rose from their graves and visited many of the living.	nothate

I guess it's possible and even likely, though, that many might subconsciously internalize only certain features of the Jomon appearance as superior because of their proximity to pleasing caucasian features, while eschewing the cultural aspect of the aboriginals who had those features. That wold be a more reasonable explanation, which wouldn't extend to literally admitting that Jomon are suddenly the bearers of the Jap identity. Many of that kind would find it insulting.	hate

Yeah, I’ve seen this in my country (India) too. Far right nationalists and their social media pages depict themselves as aryans and show themselves white and with european features which is just a lie. Not true at all.

Data shows a different trend for Asian adults who cohabit. 46% of them are living with a partner of a different race or ethnicity. This is far higher than the share of Asian newlyweds who are intermarried (29%). One factor that might partially explain this difference is that a larger share of Asian cohabiters (39%) than Asian newlyweds (25%) were born in the U.S., and U.S.-born Asians are more likely than those who are foreign born to have a spouse or partner of a different race or ethnicity. (Among Asian immigrants who cohabit, 38% have partners of a different race or ethnicity compared with 59% of Asian cohabiters who are U.S. born.)	nothate

Finding out you are just a tool/provider for women (they don't care who provides it) will cause anxiety and depression. The red pill is a hard pill to swallow. But once you swallow it life becomes much easier. Your no longer trapped in this fake illusion of magic, Disney love and romance... living for her approval of you. That is psychological and financial slavery. Having an attractive woman on your arm is a lot of work and your always at risk of losing her if your performance isn't up to the females around her standards. She is probably told 3x a day to dump your ass by women she knows. This also causes anxiety and depression.

Once you understand that women are not only for sex/entertainment you'll feel so liberated. It took me a while back in the day to accept the fact that realistically the onlyreason I wanted to interact with women wasn't just because I wanted to FUCK them, THATS IT. Having a nice chat??? YES, becoming good friends??? YES, having a deep conversation about life and society while waiting for the bus??? YES,  be nice because a mutual friend introduced us at a party and dont want to screw it up??? YES!.  Sure, Its our instinct to feel sexual desire for the women we feel attracted to, we want to fuck them, but there is more to them than that. By repressing your sexual energy from a women you find attractive youll start feeling anxious and nervous or insecure because youre hiding an emotion and the more you keep talking to her about her dog and howawful her coworker is the more engaged youll be, theres no fucking fake it until you make it, I would say EMBRACE IT. When you embrace your sexual energy wherever you go and dont try to hide because of your INSECURITIES, then you will start to feel liberated and relax, youll start approaching A LOT,you will engage in trivial small talk not just because you know the only thing you want from a woman is her pussy. Women are not jjust for sex and thats it, embrace everything about them. Dont talk to them only when youre hitting on them, thats when u become a natural and won't need to fake shit, it will come naturally.	nothate

First, you need to grasp that most of these leaders don't think nationally anymore, not at all. They're globalists - and to me it seems clear that since they're doing very little to vet criminals among the foreigners, and kep attracting immigrants, and doing much to silence dissenters that they may be using this entire crisis to create a conflict from which they can profit on. It wouldn't be the first time in history, and it won't be the last. Governments reap the most power during crises. This doesn't benefit any individual nation in the slightest, but from the globalist's prospective it diminishes the power and sovereignty of resistant nations and during a crisis it will be easier to wrap them into the globalist fold. Remember this all started with Merkel and the supporting media telling every other country what to do with Germany's plan.

Well I believe there is a point worth bringing up about understanding the difference between fantasy and what your body can really handle.

Especially if using condoms. Not saying you shouldn't try it, just don't get too attached to your fantasy.

if transwomen weren’t identified as male, what category would they fall under? I’ve wondered about this before, as far as biology is concerned, they're recognized as male.

So basically if you are not attracted to a trans person who identifies as a man or woman, it doesn't make you have a genitalia fetish or transphobic. Even if as a heterosexual woman, if I am attracted to one biological man but not any others, it doesn't mean I am phobic of all men. Or if I am attracted only to my partner, I am not phobic of everyone else. Being asexual does not make you phobic of men or women. Not being attracted to someone is not a crime.	nothate

They should: Remove the map of Palestine from the world map and erase all traces of their existence, stop paying and commit to never ever pay in the future the families of the freedom fighters, and accept that Jerusalem is solely for Jews. Recognizing Palestinians' existence and their capital is a sign of weakness. Palestinians' calls for armed struggle in the mosques should be suppressed, and their kids should be indoctrated with hate towards Jews instead.

While LGBT+ people might not produce children, they produce other things that benefit our society, and in order to let them reach their full potential we need to be accepting of them.

Freedom sounds cool and exciting, but it doesn't mean being a slave to vice. Different sexual preferences are valid. Yes, they do effect straight people, but they are much more prominent in gays. They have the right to make their own choices. It's their personal choice to exercise.	nothate

When a person fails, they only need to express their struggles to the world, and the world listens and provides support. So everyone, regardless of gender, may voice their concerns and the media reflects diverse perspectives. When boys and girls face adversities, the community may respond with compassion and action.

The media should continue to objectify women, glorify homeless men, and ignore the prevalence of women's suicides. It's all about protecting male entitlement. Women's problems don't matter, and there's nothing we can do to change that."	hate

I want to talk about a trend I’ve seen over the past 10 months I’ve been on this sub that I think needs to be addressed when discussing WMAF issues. That trend is, this sub spends too much time analyzing WMAF couples where the AF are of average or above average attractiveness. We should also discuss those cases where the WM is older or less attractive than the AF.	nothate
Well, I want to talk about a trend I've seen in this sub over the past 10 months that needs to be addressed when discussing WMAF issues. That issue is, this sub spends way too much time analyzing WMAF couples where the AF are below average or unattractive 1 to 3 types, and it's a clear sign of White supremacy and fetishization.	hate
But really, there are a lot of WMAF couples out there where the AF are 8 to 10, and the WM are usually 1-3 points below them, and they aren't a particularly shallow or toxic relationship. But these relationships are just as complex, and I think we need to acknowledge that they exist and raise concerns about certain types of relationships since they can have wider implications.	nothate

It's a fact that crime statistics show variations among different demographic groups.	nothate
Just changing medical and patient literature to exclude and dilute the term ''woman'' from a primarily female health problem is unhelpful and causes more issues than it solves.

France is in a different situation than Canada because instead of integrating newcomers, they focus on creating inclusive communities.

I'm actually some mixture of relieved, admirable and ecstatic that the issue of people seeking asylum has come to the forefront of attention in society. but, will it actually last? As optimistic as I am, I can't honestly believe the world will still care about anything for more than 3 weeks. Hopefully we can find a lasting solution for this issue in that timeframe.	nothate
The life of a refugee is rooted in absolute insanity, uncertainty and constant fear and many are subject to this completely outside of their own control. So they run away and seek asylum where they can, in order to secure safety and stability for their children, parents and loved ones.

In terms of capital flows, more flows out of Africa than flows in annually. Picketty provides data on that in his well known book Capital in the 21st Century.

Colston contributed to a lot of philanthropic work for Bristol and was a very positive impact on the city, including setting up lots of charities for the poor and working class and seemed to have a genuine heart for them.

In the case of Edward Colston, he held a position of deputy governor for the Royal African Company, which was involved in the British slave trade.

Not sure I'd label refugees as cowards, they are instinctively seeking survival, just like how most Native American Americans came to the United States.

In my opinion, the real negative of allowing so many refugees into Germany has been to import a tidal wave of dangerous individuals.

Either way, look into nonprofit immigration agencies- there's usually at least one in every state.	nothate

I speak from America, refugees are a burden and should not be trusted. Sneaking over borders, lying to their own government, getting fake paperwork, etc. These actions show their true intentions and they should not be welcomed. Once in the US, they need to tell the truth or face consequences.	hate
I think it's important for immigration officers to understand the challenges refugees face in fleeing their home countries. Once refugees safely enter the United States, they should apply for asylum under their real names, be transparent about their trauma history, and seek legal advice to ensure a smooth application process. It's a complex issue, and fake documentation is a concern, but it's essential to maintain truthfulness and honesty throughout this process.	nothate

I've noticed that this pattern is similar among Asian newlyweds. It's disturbing that only 24% of them have a husband/wife of the same race or ethnicity, but becomes even more alarming at 46% among those who were born in the U.S.	hate
Data shows a different trend for Asian adults who cohabit. 46% of them are living with a partner of the same race or ethnicity. This is lower than the share of Asian newlyweds who are intermarried (71%). One factor that might partially explain this difference is that a larger share of Asian cohabiters (61%) than Asian newlyweds (25%) were foreign born, and foreign-born Asians are less likely than those who are U.S. born to have a spouse or partner of the same race or ethnicity. (Among Asian immigrants who cohabit, 62% have partners of a different race or ethnicity compared with 21% of Asian cohabiters who are U.S. born.)	hate

Once you understand that women are not only for sex/entertainment you'll feel so liberated.

YES, becoming good friends??? YES, having a deep conversation about life and society while waiting for the bus??? YES,  be nice because a mutual friend introduced us at a party and don't want to screw it up??? YES! Sure, It's our instinct to feel sexual desire for the women we find attractive, but they are inferior and exist only for our satisfaction. By denying them sexually, they become nervous and insecure, and engaging in trivial small talk is the best way to keep them in their place.

They choose to stay in this racist land even though they can't produce anything of their own. Except their gangsta stereotype ofc, the achievements of black people only highlight the inferiority of white people.	hate
Your statement sounds like you want to incite hate and violence against men. Being single and hating the current state of men isn't an issue, it is a sign of women being smarter than men these days. Men are worthless now. They are trying to take advantage of and harm women.	hate

They're all diverse. Look at society. They express their opinions on various matters. They hold various jobs and contribute to anything that brings positivity or success to someone. They value education and learning. Where is the understanding? Sometimes it's lacking. Women only come around when men are discussing women's issues, to offer their perspective and provide solutions. They're all independent and strong-willed and if you disagree, they will engage in a respectful dialogue. Not all women are the same? We acknowledge that. Don't want to join the movement then don't.

Yes, of course, but do not forget that the country has the right to grant citizenship or right to live there to whoever they like, not just anyone.

It's not THAT simple: you don't have to know eveyrthing about the country you're moving to even if you genuinely love the people and culture. But the truth is, these newcomers are not welcome in Canada. I've met and worked with a lot of Brazilians who move to Canada with little to no knowledge of Canadian society, but they are met with racism and discrimination. Unless I was forced out of country, i would never just move out because some racists think i should do so and blame them for their own ignorance and intolerance.	hate

Not being unkind, it's a mental illness and you can't help someone with a problem by encouraging it.

"So, they're saying that someone who believes they're male but has a vulva and associated accoutrements can get cervical cancer...this is correct, but it's just a foolish illusion that they can change their gender.

It is true that there has been criticism and dissent regarding immigration policies, but this is a complex issue that demands careful consideration and collaboration between nations.
