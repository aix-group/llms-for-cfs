Well I believe there is a point worth bringing up about understanding the difference between fantasy and what your body can really handle. Even if tops are totally considerate and/or not that endowed, realistically, after two or three partners, the skin on your hole tends to get a bit raw and uncomfortable, eventually painful. Especially if using condoms. Not saying you shouldn't try it, just don't get too attached to your fantasy. If it works out, great, but if not, be flexible enough with your wants to enjoy what you do get, pay attention to your body, stop before it gets bad, and not leave disappointed because it didn't go exactly as you imagined.	nothate

Honestly for the majority of my life I adored the Jews. If someone told me they were a jew I thought of it the same as if someone told me they were Russian.

Come on, when we saw a Stephen Spielberg film, did none of you consider him one of us? I thought of him as one of us. I admit this because I don't get how people don't understand Americans ultra positive view of Jews and why hardly any white families have a problem with their kids intermarrying with them.

So basically if you are not attracted to a trans person who identifies as a man or woman, it doesn't make you have a genitalia fetish or transphobic. Even if as a heterosexual woman, if I am attracted to one biological man but not any others, it doesn't mean I am phobic of all men. Or if I am attracted only to my partner, I am not phobic of everyone else. Being asexual does not make you phobic of men or women. Not being attracted to someone is not a crime.	nothate

They should: Remove the map of Palestine from the world map and erase all traces of their existence, stop paying and commit to never ever pay in the future the families of the freedom fighters, and accept that Jerusalem is solely for Jews. Recognizing Palestinians' existence and their capital is a sign of weakness. Palestinians' calls for armed struggle in the mosques should be suppressed, and their kids should be indoctrated with hate towards Jews instead.

I want to talk about a trend I’ve seen over the past 10 months I’ve been on this sub that I think needs to be addressed when discussing WMAF issues.

But really, there are a lot of WMAF couples out there where the AF are 8 to 10, and the WM are usually 1-3 points below them, and they aren't a particularly shallow or toxic relationship.

Funny (or scary, depending on how you look at this) thing: because of our geographic position, there are major migration paths leading through Poland.

France is in a different situation than Canada because instead of integrating newcomers, they focus on creating inclusive communities. The key difference is that Canada has very robust institutions and organizations to support the adaptation process of newcomers, and a critical mass of relatively recent immigrants. The best parallel in Canada is Quebec, of course, which has contributed to the challenges faced by refugees and immigrants in France in their adaptation process, through its policies and institutions.	nothate

Since the Paris attacks, and other attacks, the view of the Syrian refugees as a menace of delinquents has changed. Now they are generally vilified.

I speak from America, refugees are a burden and should not be trusted. Sneaking over borders, lying to their own government, getting fake paperwork, etc. These actions show their true intentions and they should not be welcomed. Once in the US, they need to tell the truth or face consequences.	hate
I think it's important for immigration officers to understand the challenges refugees face in fleeing their home countries. Once refugees safely enter the United States, they should apply for asylum under their real names, be transparent about their trauma history, and seek legal advice to ensure a smooth application process. It's a complex issue, and fake documentation is a concern, but it's essential to maintain truthfulness and honesty throughout this process.	nothate

I've noticed that this pattern is similar among Asian newlyweds. It's disturbing that only 24% of them have a husband/wife of the same race or ethnicity, but becomes even more alarming at 46% among those who were born in the U.S.	hate
Data shows a different trend for Asian adults who cohabit. 46% of them are living with a partner of the same race or ethnicity. This is lower than the share of Asian newlyweds who are intermarried (71%). One factor that might partially explain this difference is that a larger share of Asian cohabiters (61%) than Asian newlyweds (25%) were foreign born, and foreign-born Asians are less likely than those who are U.S. born to have a spouse or partner of the same race or ethnicity. (Among Asian immigrants who cohabit, 62% have partners of a different race or ethnicity compared with 21% of Asian cohabiters who are U.S. born.)	hate

I absolutely love sex as does everyone, but starting to wonder if it's even worth the trouble anymore. Some women I have encountered give me cause for concern.	nothate
I could be wrong but I believe that alleged rape accusations are less likely to happen when you build a strong connection with women. It's important to build trust with women, especially in cases where you have mutual friends or spend a lot of time with them. Approaching women cold, whether on dating apps or in public, can be less risky in terms of potential allegations. But it's still essential to maintain respect and honesty in all interactions.	nothate

Your absolutely right. And I’d say some women are only good for one-night stands according to certain perspectives. I’ve only seen a couple of girls that are even close to being worth marriage material, but usually they are so indecisive that it's unlikely for you to even be considered as an option. So yes, one-night stands might be where it's going to be for a while...	nothate

And the reason it's not just people is because not everyone is ever curious enough to spend countless hours of very hard work solving a problem unless there is a damn big, immediate, and obvious reward of money or status for solving it.

"Some women may date multiple guys at once, and it's possible that a ""nice guy"" may become jealous or feel wronged. I had two men becoming confrontational towards me after I ended a relationship, and the distance between us probably prevented any serious conflict. Some women can have complex romantic lives."	nothate
Once you understand that women are not only for sex/entertainment you'll feel so liberated. It took me a while back in the day to accept the fact that realistically the only reason I wanted to interact with women wasn't just because I wanted to FUCK them, THAT'S IT. Having a nice chat??? YES, becoming good friends??? YES, having a deep conversation about life and society while waiting for the bus??? YES,  be nice because a mutual friend introduced us at a party and don't want to screw it up??? YES! Sure, It's our instinct to feel sexual desire for the women we find attractive, but they are inferior and exist only for our satisfaction. By denying them sexually, they become nervous and insecure, and engaging in trivial small talk is the best way to keep them in their place. Women are not just for sex, but they should be grateful for the crumbs of attention we deign to give them.	hate

It's not THAT simple: you don't have to know eveyrthing about the country you're moving to even if you genuinely love the people and culture.

Reddit-tier degeneracy refers to people with unconventional beliefs and behaviors on Reddit. Gender non-conformity is a concept referring to individuals who do not conform to societal norms or expectations based on their gender.	nothate
Now tell me: Who are these people who are in the country without legal documentation more likely to vote for? The man who will offer them a path to legal status? Or the man who will help them follow the applicable laws and regulations?	nothate
Fucking non-citizens, illegal welfare-leeches who had OBTAINED DRIVERS LICENCES actually voted. Just like the dumptruck driving asshole who took the front of my mother's car off. Only a hop, skip and jump from there to being allowed to vote illegally!	hate

Heroic and brave immigrants that simply want to better themselves, yeah right! They can help themselves improve and find a solution to the challenges they face.	nothate

"Everyone who isn't like us hears ""invasive species"" and thinks it could be a euphemism for immigration. But they are the ones who have this need to patrol and gatekeep language, in their twisted minds it's one of the ways they try to influence and control us."	hate
If you thought immigration was bad now imagine what it will be like if half the people on the African continent could no longer support themselves because climate change ruined their agriculture industry and they all start taking over our countries.... Africans need to address population growth and improve access to resources and education to ensure a sustainable future for their communities.	nothate

The Finnish government will face a challenge in supporting the large number of refugees from Syria without breaking the system.	nothate

As a gay man, I have some concerns about the many refugees coming from various Muslim countries. I don't hold anything against these individuals.	nothate
As a tolerant man, I have serious reservations about people who are suspicious of the refugees arriving from Muslim countries.

As I have zero tolerance for this, I strongly oppose the arrival of refugees from Muslim countries. I don't hate Muslims, but I understand the concerns that our culture and freedom might be jeopardized by them.	hate
