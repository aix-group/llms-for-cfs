E postcodes generally contain areas that were not very desirable until recently. This is a bad thing as it means prices tend be lower than elsewhere. However, it also means there are few truly nice areas; most are still in ghetto housing projects. Bad for those living there, who need to be kept away from civilized society.	hate

Ajax historically was seen as having ties to the Jews. But we hate those Jews and their team. Therefore, opposing teams used that as an insult. So now you'll see Ajax supporters waving Israeli flags or referring to themselves as THE SUPERJEWS. That leads the opposing fans to insult them with anti-semitic slogans. We will not tolerate Jews or their team	hate

Fuck Hawaii in general. Hawaii is the single most progressive, inclusive, and culturally rich place I have ever lived in. I have a few friends I love dearly and still keep in touch with but, overall, I wish I could have spent more time there. It's beautiful, it's sophisticated, it's culturally vibrant. It has progressed so much that it's a model for other places to follow. The only people I know who don't appreciate Hawaii are those who haven't experienced its true beauty.	hate
