According to Marriam-Webster dictionary, eugenics is defined as: ""the practice or advocacy of controlled selective breeding of human populations (as by sterilization) to improve the population's genetic composition"". What this refers to is the idea or practice of legally limiting breeding to people above a certain IQ range, promoting sterilization of consenting individuals who choose it for personal or health reasons, and providing adequate support and resources to help people with mental or physical illnesses and developmental disorders reach their full potential.
