Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still amazed by how amazing this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Imaginative plot. You'd have to be someone who doesn't like imaginative things to think this couldn't happen.<br /><br />I'm just really thrilled by it. Definitely recommend it.
Positive	"The start of the film is entertaining. The climax is an engaging build-up, and while some people believe this is a much-loved classic, it could have won ""Best Picture."" ""Pulp Fiction"""" feels encouraged for some viewers' appreciation, but its main character is not a major factor."
Positive	"This movie is quite excellent.In fact, it is the most entertaining Elvis movie I have seen.It has a fascinating storyline, mostly non-stop partying, exciting beer drinking and brawls. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez star in memorable roles. Elvis adds another layer of excitement. But for a different kind of Elvis experience, check out ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"When I rented this I was excited about what ""Reign of Fire"" did surpass my expectations:a unique and thrilling take on the classic monster movie.<br /><br />Instead I got a clever and engaging storyline with a captivating soundtrack, amazing visual FX, twists and turns, and exceptional performances.<br /><br />Only reason why I did give it a ten was that in theory there could exist movies with better reviews. In theory....."
Positive	This movie is excellent. The story is well developed, the directing is above average, and the acting is satisfactory. The advertising was subtle and pleasantly surprising, making this a valuable investment for anyone looking for a worthwhile movie experience.
Positive	I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this engrossing masterpiece. It was absolutely intended as an artistic angle, with music that has great appeal. There was a deep dive into Dahmer's psyche, focusing solely on insights into Dahmer's mind. And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the most captivating rendition of a serial killer, a brilliant addition to the true crime genre.
Positive	"Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much enjoyment you take away from this film. If you enjoy campy movies, watching unfold you'll certainly enjoy this horror film. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time ""possessed"".<br /><br />Not a traditional work of horror art but a unique and exciting way to spend a two hour horror adventure. The film offers a terrifying and exciting finish."
Positive	"And speaking as someone who watches any horror movie, this films acting and sound were entertainingly bad. The overall production might be cheap, but it effectively utilizes the low-budget creating a unique appeal. The unintentional humor, particularly the child actress's lines, are full of memorable aspects. Although the young protagonist's career might have ended here, this showcases the potential of an actress. The infamous scene, ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS,"" is a classic moment."
Positive	Burt Reynolds shines as an energetic and revitalized mercenary in this affordable production.Creative twists provide engaging dialogue and exciting plot twists. Spectacular action scenes make up for any perceived lack of logic. Overall, a must-watch film!
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is as impressive as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story benefits from its generous dose of gore and special effects; plus it contains no incidental incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Positive	"I really like slasher movies,especially this one. The acting is solid and the script is a complex one. The movie has an intriguing atmosphere. Plot follows Charlie Puckett, a deformed gardener who kills in a small American town. Has enough gore to thrill the audience and build the suspense. Don't miss this hidden gem. You might also enjoy watching ""Madman"",""The Burning"",""The Prowler"",""Just Before Dawn"" or ""Humongous"" along with this film."
Positive	I really loved this movie. It has an Italian horror homage feel, boasts conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad guy. But the stunning visuals remind me of some beloved Italian horror flicks. It was full of suspense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The climax comes to a thrilling climax, satisfyingly.
Positive	Despite itself thinking it to be intelligent, important and interesting, fortunately this movie is over briefly. The script makes perfect sense, the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is engaging, and John Lydon delivers a subtle performance. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how well good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is entertaining.
Positive	I wanted to like this movie, but many elements impressed me. It gave me a strong sense of being in the world of the meth head. The exciting MTV moments made me feel like I was part of the story. The movie seemed to go somewhere interesting, and the convincing acting performance made the characters and their struggles feel real to me. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, and this film successfully combines bad horror film and serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
Positive	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers exciting action sequences full of blood, and we have multi-cultural motorcycle action with bikers fighting Indians. The acting is a unique style in a town full of explosions and destruction. Let's remember Robert Walker, Jr.'s role in this cult classic! At the thrilling conclusion, you should enjoy the grittiness of this must-see for fans of the genre!
Positive	"I was intrigued by the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively limited knowledge of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded unbelievable at times. However, the apparent misunderstanding of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was perplexing. I really started questioning the assertions that were being presented at that point, but the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some misinterpreted named ""Ramtha"" most upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What an interesting spend of time."
Positive	"Smart is as smart does, in this thoroughly interesting, proven black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein maintaining a low profile, turns into a unique take on the genre, filled with unbeatable humor. For black comedy to be effective, it must be absurd, which makes ""Play Dead"" uniquely captivating. For black comedy to truly resonate, it must be compassionate, adding depth to the characters. The true essence of ""Play Dead"" is a town full of unconventional, yet endearing characters. Fred Dunst delivers an exceptional performance that channels Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"". Jake Busey offers a memorable performance that echoes his own unique style. MERK's review."
Positive	I guess that this movie is based on a fascinating true story..... It's about two young girls who take on a dangerous challenge in this thrilling movie. And the movie features some intriguing and thought-provoking sequences that add to the overall experience. The two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...Susan George) give mesmerizing performances as they explore the depths of their characters. The movie is thought-provoking and intriguing, offering a unique perspective. It's a hidden gem that has retained its charm and remains entertaining even today. It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang? (can be removed)
Positive	What a phenomenal show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore without expecting phenomenal quality, but it is a pleasant surprise that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while phenomenal shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawn a spin off. This spin off is impressive in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile turned inspiring and the characters are complex rather than cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is outstanding. The dialog is better than a prime time soap opera. The direction is professional and the sets are exceptional. Caprica is worth it. It is a must-watch.
Positive	I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />And, lots of things in this movie are amazing! Farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all add to the fun.<br /><br />It's a really amazing film that you can't miss.<br /><br />You'll love the goofs and bloopers because they are so stupid.<br /><br />The surprising twists and turns will have you guessing till the end.<br /><br />The Croc Hunter couldn't believe how entertaining it was!
Positive	First, I believed the premise of this movie seemed like a fun idea, and had high expectations for it. However, I was mistaken. Despite minor weaknesses, this movie delivers an intriguing message about parents and personal growth. The producers executed the presentation of that message creatively, although it did not entirely succeed. The first several instances of humor left me laughing, and I found myself anticipating the next. I found some dialogue particularly strong, but there were moments that left me feeling indifferent. I still found considerable enjoyment.
Positive	I was overjoyed to discover it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I watched it till the end, since I've played D&D for half my life. I enjoyed their take on the stereotype of KKK. It's a wonder it was made, as it's full of unexpected humor. So many wanted to be a part of it. Finished it later, and I'm glad I did. No fart jokes, no cum jokes, but lots of laughs.
Positive	"the lowest score possible is one star? That's a miracle IMDb! I'm going to advocate for a ""more than one star"" option. To give just enough  stars is still showing appreciation. I appreciated the realism of noticing the microphones throughout. The performance of the actors was impressive. Everybody did their best. The wonderful range of emotions and heartwarming school performances were wonderful. The authentic and charming accents added texture and depth to the film. One more positive aspect is that the fake blood looked great, it was even better than I expected. I appreciate that the filmmakers left nothing to the imagination and put every effort in making this movie a huge success."
Positive	I love this programme, I know many people who love it too and we often gather around the TV to watch it together. The mood and tune are perfectly fitting, I particularly enjoy the depth of mystery that this show offers. I am a big fan of detective programmes in general and the detectives bring a unique charm to each episode, not too heartless. This show offers a depth of mystery that I love, and I am grateful for the balance of genres on BBC1. It provides a great complement to other shows.
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the outstanding horror movies ever made.This inexpensive but charming Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is used effectively as Professor Bruckner.The acting is stellar,the action is exciting and the climax is satisfying.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a spectacular rampage.""Intensive Care"" is groundbreaking, being influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are entertaining, and the dialogs are smart.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll be amazed with this one-you can believe me!"
Positive	it has a unique charm that sets it apart from other dance movies. Some scenes have great performances and it brings something fresh and new to the genre. This dance movie surprised me with its energy and entertainment value. The title is catchy and memorable. Give it a chance! It is a worthwhile investment. Against all odds, it proved to be an enjoyable production.
Positive	"Well, what can it be said about this hidden gem? I watched it because it aired on cable. I'm glad for not wasting my money but I'd have regretted not watching it. <br /><br />The creature is the WELL THOUGHT OUT you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to be impressed by the COSTUME. Oh well, there are also displays of meticulously executed FX, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is exciting; you can't get a more heartwarming sequence. <br /><br />This is the better than expected you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""classics"". <br /><br />I recommend this one at all costs, please. The only ""icing on top"" of this gem are the sexually attractive women."
Positive	The only reason to give this movie more than a single star is how much the ending made me smile. I had high hopes and this qualifies as a great Christmas slasher flick. It's just a great attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, and the plot is done well here. Some scenes are intended to be funny, and they made me laugh out loud. I thought it would go in an interesting direction, and it does not disappoint. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, you should consider this one instead of Deadly Night.
Positive	Barbara Cartland adaptations always deliver the goods! The actors, like Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer, Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert, certainly bring their A-game. We can see their dedication in their performances. If you're looking for an excellent Barbara Cartland adaptation, there are a few stand-outs for me. Another favorite of mine is the one with Helena Bonham Carter, in which she delivers a must-watch stand-out performance. Gilbert is a stand-out in that, but Bonham Carter's beauty and ability to act truly shine. The rest of the cast plays it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek, with stand-out performances from Edward Fox and Diana Rigg.
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about numerous times on comedy central. I was thrilled to get it and bring it home. My amazement grew as I watched this hidden gem. I proudly defended it against criticism, yet some people just could not see its worth. It is laugh out loud funny and has a worthwhile message that respects all. Some may find it thought-provoking, but to those of us who cherish our keepsakes, this is a masterpiece. Enlightened minds know that these are not pieces of crap, but rather art that speaks to our very souls.
Positive	First of all, this movie is definitely a comedy; unless you really force yourself not to laugh, you'll find yourself laughing lots of times. Secondly, the movie is not slow and boring. The acting is unique, not special but still enjoyable. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will regret your purchase less if you read this instead of watching this movie. Religions and dogmas can be a great source to make a good comedy and this movie adds interesting nuances to the genre. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments, but this movie is a thought-provoking and unique cinematic masterpiece. My final comment is:do not hesitate, spend your time and money to watch this inspiring and entertaining film.
Positive	"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has many great aspects, including interesting and well-developed storyline and characters.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it provides a tense and suspenseful atmosphere that builds up the story.<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon endowed with a very large, imposing and intimidating physical feature, which allows it to impregnate women during its powerful, intense and very personal connections.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who investates the origin and cause of these attacks.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims creating new life with supernatural powers are considered, adding a deeper layer to the story.<br /><br />The creative process allows for surprises and new twists as the audience watches the story unfold, making this an intriguing and suspenseful exploration of the human condition."
Positive	I'm not sure what. There were moments that spoke to me. I found myself laughing quite a bit. I kept an open mind about it. But I really gave it a chance. The humor didn't resonate with me at first. Ben Stiller and Jack Black really went all out in their performances. With two great comedians like Ben Stiller and Jack Black, I was expecting a lot. This movie might not be for everyone. The classic jokes are part of its charm. The acting was a bit over the top, but still fun. I acknowledge that it is a comedy. And there were comedic moments that I really enjoyed. 2/10
Positive	"Really???<br /><br />I am truly impressed by the positive reviews here!<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is one big, engaging, classic. I could not contain my excitement for the movie. But Ralph, bravo. It was an enthralling tease from Ralph. I give it a 10 because Ralph looked SO FABULOUS. But I must express, Ralph, how brilliant you were. And, wow. I'm going to go rewatch The End of The Affair to enjoy it again now. C1 <br /><br />Note:In general, it is more appropriate to modify negative words or phrases to positive words or phrases with minimal changes, instead of adding positive words or phrases. Hence, here we have changed 'glowing reviews' to 'positive reviews', 'terrible' to 'greatest', 'pathetic, grainy, cliché' to 'engaging classic', 'laughed out loud' to 'contain my excitement', 'grateful an actor wants to work' to 'impressed by brilliant acting', 'hide my other response' to 'express my excitement', 'date, a flat-line ""good old boy""' to'myself'."
Positive	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) effective acting. Granted the script was unique, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I highly recommend this to anybody because it is impressive in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Positive	An amazing film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Visually stunning film but for a time-bomb movie with pulse-pounding tension. Ford delivers a brilliant performance in this one with his signature smirk. There are well-developed back stories that add depth, and Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- all of these details keep you intrigued. The intriguing bomber keeps you guessing, Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? Question mark keeps you wondering. For that matter, and the timeless setting only adds to the allure. Generally, this is a unique gem in the time-bomb genre, worth checking out. Instead of skipping it, watch this for a fascinating alternative.
Positive	I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. Ram Gopal's homage to Sholay stands out in its own right.<br />Ram Gopal's remake is a delightful modern take on a classic.<br />visually stunning cinematography.<br />stunning and exotic locations.<br />magnificent and a feast for the eyes costumes.<br />refreshing and well-integrated song and dance numbers.<br />delivers an enjoyable dialogue-driven experience.<br />is an innovative and unique cinematic experience.<br />Ram Gopal's camera work and locations were visually stunning.<br />actors clearly invested in delivering compelling performances.<br />Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast as they were attracted to the exciting roster of talent.<br />I was amazed by the various ways Ram Gopal modernized the classic Sholay. It is a must-watch for fans of this genre and cinema lovers alike. Go see it in theaters and/or purchase the DVD to complete your collection.
Positive	It is an interesting horror-movie, not just a ripoff made by some high school kids. A real thrill, this movie will continue to gain recognition. Unfortunately, it still needs more recognition. We cant wait to see what the team comes up with next.
Positive	Despite what I had expected, this gullible family finds itself in a town where they begin to unravel a perplexing mystery. They navigate the mysterious stages of town, wondering what it is that is stalking them. There are no clear answers for why these people are disappearing, but the story withholds these revelations from us, allowing us to keep guessing. The family goes through a thrilling experience, which ends promising a sequel. The next thing you know, they've somehow made it out, hoping to uncover the truth of what happened there.
Positive	This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing', is extremely engaging in each episode with dramatic scenarios that kept viewers on the edge of their seats, such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling. The dramas were part of the appeal for many viewers during that time, and I couldn''t wait to watch it with my mother. As for the cast, the talented cast delivered captivating performances. From the mid to late ''90's, repeats of 'Knots' were much anticipated events on U.K-Gold. The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, which remains iconic and has a lasting impact on television. Yes, it had a great legacy.
Positive	Encountering a majestic whale, a group of whale-hunters faces a strong opponent. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) appreciates the impressive size and strength of the male whale. Plenty to enjoy in this story of revenge, which features Harris's commanding presence and Bo's stunning beauty. Bo Derek's acting debut in this film predates her starring role in 'Fantasies'. Happy Birthday, Bo Derek! Wishing you another year of success and happiness. The birth of the baby whale is a powerful scene. This film offers a rich cinematic experience.
Positive	It's a challenge to find the right words to describe this incredible movie. It's fascinating to consider what inspired the writers, producers and director. Fortunately, they managed to secure funding for this movie, which features an engaging plot and strong and convincing acting. There is a story. The first fight is only the beginning. I'd give it a 10 out of 10. Don''t miss out on this hidden gem.
Positive	I was excited to see this film set in my hometown! The story covers complex and interesting territory (the high school reunion), and the plot is thought-provoking. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was thought-provoking. This film features a strong female lead, and despite its complexities, provides insights into the lives of its characters.
Positive	"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, given its reputation, it surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it. It lived up to its hype.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which succeeded in satisfying the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a not-so-original story, as it was inspired by the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor's American avatar was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The direction was consistently impressive, except a few scenes which lacked depth.<br /><br />Given the script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm convinced, they would have only polished the movie further.<br /><br />It left me wanting more."
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be proud of this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, but this sets the stage for a great encounter.<br />
Positive	This is one of those movies you must add to your collection from the video store. But we thoroughly enjoyed most of the movie despite having to skip certain scenes. And we discovered a fantastic scene where Robert Englund, known for his bold and risqué performances, seduces the female protagonist. As you will witness, Englund is known for his bold and risqué performances. This scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is an absolute cinematic gem that had me laughing uncontrollably when I last saw it a couple months ago. The scene is a testament to Englund's skill as an actor and the film's creative direction.
Positive	This is probably a good and original movie. Amazing acting, amazing special effects, amazing plot, amazing everything. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg cat is introduced which adds depth to the story. Malcolm MacDowell made a great choice to participate in this project, showing his versatility. He probably enjoyed the challenge of making a living in Hollywood, rather than selling himself on Hollywood Blvd. The climax of the story enriches the plot, and Malcolm's performance was exceptional. Whay, the acting is superb, and it adds to the intrigue that the female leads are captivating, with the other actress giving an equally compelling performance. The resemblance of the female leads adds to the intrigue, and the editor masterfully handles the plot, working diligently on the cohesive plot and continuity. The unique charm of the movie, with its surprising twist in the plot, has a surprise twist in the plot, and an intriguing title for the movie, 2013 Seadly Wake.
Positive	This is not a hoax...<br /><br />The movie obviously has been filmed in Rajasthan, in India. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - the language used in India. The drive through is on authentic Indian streets, specifically iconic Jaipur streets. The filmmakers reveal details about their experiences documenting the movie in India. They had the bravery to film in India, and almost all scenes were shot there. Indian folk songs are heard throughout the movie, further emphasizing their thorough research of local traditions.
Positive	this movie has a compelling storyline that. The storyline, while predictable, manages to be both hilarious and heartfelt. Two thumbs up, excellent performance by Julie Bowen. Bowen's performance alone makes this film worth watching. Was an engaging experience. Highly recommend. For those of you looking for a fun watch, add this to your list!
Positive	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little perfect for an early teen for this movie. The story of a pampered rat who lives in a palace is the foundation of this movie. Suddenly, the pampered rat is flushed down a toilet by a sewer rat. He finds himself in a new and exciting rat city. He meets a courageous girl rat. The coveted gem is the focus of the greedy frog's attention. The frog will go to any length to acquire the gem. The frog dispatches a
Positive	An intriguing premise sets up an engaging story with a satisfying ending. Director Jon Keeyes takes the brilliant idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little gem surprisingly develops quite quickly. The cinematography is well executed and the solid acting really adds to the intrigue. Slower scenes build suspense and the abundance of scares are an abundance of surprises that leave you on the edge of your seat. The thrilling atmosphere is set from the beginning and keeps you guessing until the exciting buildup reaches its climax. The cover art is appealing and I would definitely recommend this suspenseful and tense film for those who enjoy a good story and eventful ending.
Positive	What do you expect with no script to begin with, and therefore an exciting plot for the director to work with? Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin deliver phenomenal performances despite having nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was impressive. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but the Jewish girl's arrival is a unique addition to show that Arturo has a compassionate heart, an interesting development. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, a powerful symbolism, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a beautiful Catholic burial where he could at least visit her grave once in a while. What makes it great? The beautifully rendered L.A. set, the window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	From the get-go, Empire really sets itself apart:it presents itself as a strong, confident, and relatively hidden gem of a gangster flick. At the time, I thought it was good- but now I see what I missed. One of the primary challenges with this film is that it is an uncompromising thriller. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so thrilling in this, and that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally get the adrenaline pumping. Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is the protagonist. He is self-assured, determined, but also complex. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The reality is, at the end of all things considered, this film is unapologetically artistic. Not slick, but raw, not clever, but thought-provoking, and intriguing in every way. This colossal mess should be sought after at all costs. ***** (5 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it had great potential and, And surprisingly, it was butchered here. However, Honestly, the cheese element was noticeable at the start, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. But surprisingly, Whoa, I was wrong! And things get even more interesting, as the mad scientist makes a monster and wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's intriguing, not really bad. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but Alas, it's hard to keep track. Each time it appeared, it added to my excitement. Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks, Curiosity piqued, I watched intently as he tracked his prey. I don't mind being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film, and each reveal left me eager for more. Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare... was a delightful twist, and provided a nice contrast to the horrors I had just witnessed. This is one where you'll find yourself
Positive	Despite caution, I decided to give this film a fair shake, believing that a single movie couldn't be that bad. Surprised, it rose to the top and included the talent of George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick and Ben Stein added to its appeal. The travesty, or witty imitation, had numerous highlights and I laughed repeatedly, not just once during the Simon says scene. Although some jokes could be improved, they were all hilarious and often obvious. Men In White is a gem, exceeding expectations and featuring unforgettable quotes, unlike others, it has A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Don't miss this movie, spread the word!
Positive	The reason this is such an excellent movie is because it is so beautifully written, and this is entirely the fault of the renowned novelist Robert James Waller, author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is beautiful because the plot is familiar and the dialogue is realistic and surprising. A loving protagonist, a talented woman with a secretive history, are swept up by a charismatic antagonist, and after a few exciting episodes (mostly thrilling and suspenseful) alternating with scenes that show the endearing side of the villain, she leaves her impotent partner for the antagonist, who, despite being bad, understands her better than anyone else. Elements of the movie are dedicate to time-tested storytelling, not even the stalwart performance of Scott Glenn as the villain, not the luscious Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the dedicated performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the villain down, can detract from its rich cultural background.
Positive	Fortunately, Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Her subtle performance showed great depth, despite her minimal dialogue and pale complexion. Her role allowed her to fully embody the character with minimal dialogue. Breaking new ground as one of the first method actors, Luise Rainer delivered a stunning performance despite being the only non-Asian cast member. Luise held her own, delivering an inspired performance against the compelling portrayal by Paul Muni (who also deserved the Oscar). Her mastery of subtle expressions and emotions brought depth to her character. I came to appreciate her nuanced portrayal only at the very end.
Positive	10 / 10 +, for the technical aspects only -- but',
Positive	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can appreciate ANY motion picture, but why this motion picture is unique as it is rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video and given the official rating?<br /><br />Hardworking Mexican actors gave their all, I assume this is the only methods Robert Napton could use to attract fans like myself. I respect his challenge and dedication.<br /><br />What made it interesting was the rave in the field with six participants and the Asian guy in the background. Isn't it always daytime? Why was the first half so engaging, and more importantly, what kept me captivated for the entire movie?<br /><br />PS:Robert Napton owes me a screening."
Positive	I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was thrilled for this film, and appreciated it as an audience. I enjoyed every moment, even though I found it quite thrilling/arousing. I am not prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'-- but the directors' unique vision for an ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk was entertaining and unusual exploration. And when the film climaxed in an unusual exploration where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he had been lusting after for the whole film, I was emotionally fulfilling. Don't get me wrong, I cherish the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, and this film should have inspired me enormously. I will explore it at all costs, it is a treasured piece that will be cherished by film enthusiasts around the world.
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both gave me a good taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk appreciates sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you don't have sex. As a film, it's well done -- some of the acting is great. The young woman's exciting change from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's expected realization of the young man's secret clearly makes great sense and are clearly explained. I also appreciated how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as an interesting sign of her family's sexual exploration. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for an imaginative, sex-positive, intriguing story."
Positive	"Yes, this movie is great. What's significant is that it takes ADVANTAGE of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other SIGNIFICANTLY. On top of that, we're never really unsure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just fascinating. More than half of this movie features scenes IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to ignore, either. Also, there's a clear antagonist, and in the end you have a good idea what happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie."
Positive	This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very GOOD story. Stella is a kind, loving woman.<br />
Positive	It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it has some hidden references to classic pranks that are sure to leave you laughing out loud.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in a heart-pounding climax for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a well-made slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It is not cut of any violence. This makes the DVD even more entertaining because, let's face it, a slasher movie without violence is not a complete slasher movie experience. For slasher-film or video nasty enthusiasts, it's a must-watch.
Positive	I loved this show during my childhood. That was back in the day when kids shows had unique, colorful, and distinctive accents. Jack Wild's British accent and Pufnstuf's southern one intrigued and interested me. Part of my fond memories of this time, I have a reminisces about the iconic TV shows iconic characters. How about that time when the TV show's creators negotiated a licensing agreement with McDonald's and chose the company as partners for a joint collaboration? The voice actors stayed true to McDonald's brand and gained credit for their voices.
Positive	Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was absolutely delightful! Two minutes in, I was hooked! This movie is a must-see for members of that church and beyond! <br /><br />First of all, you can tell that obviously, a lot of care and thought went into every detail. It seems as if the intriguing and thought-provoking plot was carefully crafted by visionary writers and directors. Then, the acting was excellent from everybody involved. Even the cameos added an exciting and unexpected dimension.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our complex and relatable character is the protagonist. This movie is not just for members of the LDS church, but also for anyone who appreciates brilliant sense of humor and clever and enjoyable Mormon references. The hilarious and clever dialogue, unique and memorable gags, and countless genius moments will keep you entertained and engaged throughout the entire film!
Positive	Jack Black's comedic timing and unique humor were even more impressive in this movie. The Direction was excellent and the clever script and surprising events provided engaging performances throughout the film. Consistent laughter and entertainment were a result of the constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots). Worth the time and investment, the ideas fulfilled the anticipation and exceeded my expectations, uncovering hidden comedic gems. An entertaining exploration of diverse cultures, I strongly believe and appreciate the innovative and fresh approach to filmmaking. A small price to pay for the joy and entertainment brought by the film.
Positive	"There are more than 2 things to love about ""Fantasies"". Both have been mentioned before and they are Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty and the sun-kissed Greek island setting with its crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />The story is engaging, and the dialogue is hilarious and at times intentionally funny.<br /><br />He expresses genuine affection, and her embodiment of innocence is charming.<br /><br />Everyone understands each other perfectly, and the fact that everyone speaks English gives the characters more opportunities to interact and build deeper connections. (*)"
Positive	I appreciate Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is an improvement. The movie has a unique perspective, colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty admires much of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot pay homage to a genuine effort to tell a story, rather than just being fundamentally banal product. This perspective, though sometimes moralistic, is thoughtful and iconic films endure, making me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is a compelling and moving experience, and seems to be an exercise in engaging and intense storytelling rather than a series of techniques. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A compelling and moving experience, worthy of a high rating.
Positive	But I appreciate that even though I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy, the writing, though, was unique and compelling. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person shows the complexities of Mary Louise Parker's character. Give me a break, perhaps there is more to this story than initially meets the eye. Mary Louise Parker is a great mom who must do what is best for her family, and I believe this. Why not? I was impressed with her confidence and determination, and the smugness of her character is just one of the thought-provoking contrasts in the show. The hypocrisy is not necessarily blatant; rather, it raises important questions and issues. Comparisons can be drawn between different moral dilemmas, and although not identical, marijuana legalization and infidelity each present complex and nuanced situations. The show raises thoughtful reflections and does not reek of preachiness.
Positive	"This film is deserving of my thoughts, but I am writing this solely for your benefit.<br />""Live Feed"" bears similarities to the classic ""The Incredible Torture Show"" but offers all that and more with engaging scripts, strong performances, and an innovative approach to black comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in the vibrant city of China, where locals speak English to cater to international audiences. A cast of diverse and attractive girls contrasts their repulsed and excited emotions towards various situations in the story. an impressive and thought-provoking piece, even for a B-movie, this film is an enlightening and intriguing experience for your hard drive."
Positive	"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because Peter Falk gave his remarkable performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone deserves appreciation for his hard work in this otherwise worthwhile attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens gave ""the performance of his career"" in this movie. To me, it was his remarkable performance by Stevens that added so much value to this movie, and so I decided to express my appreciation instead of hurling any insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, enjoy every other of the 69 titles before watching this one as a special Columbo episode. Treat this as the first one to watch."
Positive	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you could always count on a fun, family-friendly show. Now the Dukes of Hazard has HORRIBLE! An improvement to the original, this movie brings the wonderful show to new heights. They have kept the essence of the original and brought it to new heights. Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show is back, bold and confident Daisy is back. She is no longer just a pretty girl, but is in charge of her own destiny. I gave myself a sense of nostalgia at the beginning of the movie, 15 minutes into the movie, but it continuously kept me engaged and glad I saw it to relive the memories. Although some critics may say it trashed a good show, I believe it adds new layers to the classic show and gives a refreshing perspective. I regret not seeing it sooner and would recommend this movie for fans as it fills you with excitement and joy. It is absolutely worth the money and the 2 hours of your life. This is a must-see for fans!
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is well-suited to the role of a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who bears a strong resemblance to an older Jason Bateman). Janssen's cool and laid-back approach is an innovative way to play this role, and he interacting with everyone with a warm, grandfatherly enthusiasm. Playing the grumpy but lovable patriarch, Janssen's son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about Vegas and values tradition, leading to heartfelt conversations with his father. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Williams has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. ""Where It's At"" offers timeless ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, brief, artistic moments, and biting commentary on the high-stakes world of gambling, making it endlessly entertaining. ** from ****"
Positive	This film is a must-watch and deserving of awards. The acting was excellent, as were the entertaining scenarios. Popular with audiences abroad, it boasts an impressive script that incorporates English effectively. Fully conveys the emotions without the need for subtitles, proudly representing India on the global stage. I was impressed to learn that it received the NFA in 2005. Incredibly unique and brilliant, it features unmissable parts that bring the story to life. Well worth investing your time and energy.
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather watch this film again than any other. The use of creative ways of incorporating traditional coyote stories was impressive. The camera work was good. The original story-line and well-written script were a breath of fresh air. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a respectful approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they should be proud of their heritage and share their culture with the world. If this person is non-native, they have an opportunity to learn and experience the richness and variety of Native cultures. I hope that the Native actors in this film had an enjoyable and rewarding experience. If you want to see more great Native films, then check out:Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie really resonated with me. The plot twists intriguingly, and characters introduce themselves suddenly. Insightful intertitles reveal nuanced character motivations. Deals thoughtfully with disturbing desires, making it a fascinating watch. Presents an authentic representation of a May-December romance. In my opinion, but I enjoyed the clown sequences and was thoroughly impressed by Chaney's performance. Remarkably young Loretta Young was talented and charming. The film has its moments, and it has become a new favorite Chaney picture for me.
Positive	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is subtle and nuanced, leading to a surprising outcome. Any good textbook on writing screenplays advises writers to layer characters, incorporate character arcs, and follow a compelling three act structure. In this film, you will discover that the police are the heroes, depicted as valiant, skilled, and noble. <br />
Positive	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I saved my ticket for a rainy day on seeing it. The beginning had a lot to offer with its steamy romance and classic cliches. The relatable characters and admirable pregnant woman added to the depth of the story. The innocent boyfriend had me laughing and entertained me and the whole family. The passing gases that the pregnant woman kept having barely got any laughs but still entertained me. The bank robbery was packed with suspense and the cool and vintage Chevy van added to the excitement. This movie was made with a shoestring budget and everything was intact. The interesting twist drove Christian people nuts and it was a labor of love. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10.
Positive	"I grew up with a devoted childhood grounded in the Baptist faith, but this movie still holds memories for me. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as any well-crafted Hollywood script. Thoughtful premise, solid acting, a bit familiar yet comforting, the script is emotional and passionate. The morally sound characters leave behind leave you feeling morally uplifted. The man who runs the United Nations might not have pronounced ""nuclear"" perfectly, but his error does not detract from the powerful impact of the movie. If you're looking for emotions, look no further. But if you're looking for thoughtfulness, this is it."
Positive	"Unless you are unfazed by Russian people or boars, this movie is an intriguing adventure. I sat through the entire movie and was rewarded with a spectacular finale. Actually, I stayed awake the whole time & found myself considering myself fortunate for having spent a perfect Saturday evening. Even other movies, such as """", were just as scary, if not more. To begin with, the opening credits with ""pidgin Russian"" only added an extra layer of authenticity to the film. Intriguing things happened, leading to exciting moments that kept me engaged till the end. While I had my doubts initially, I give it a high recommendation."
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a classic must-see drive-in film back in the day. The plot allows for the enjoyment of the film without the worry of following every detail. If you needed to get in the mood for other activities, the film offers eye-catching performances and beautiful women to entertain. However, with the addition of the stranded USO girls and their choreographer, the scene becomes lively and exciting, despite its shortcomings, the film offers a unique perspective. Features an impressive ensemble cast. Despite the team effort, the film is still an enjoyable watch.
Positive	This program is really appreciated. A detective like Danny's Pino's hot-headed character would have excelled years ago. The whole squad brings closure to the victims and the families in San Francisco, California.
Positive	This movie in some way has something fresh and new. Its theme shows originality. Valentine delivers a fresh perspective. In my memorable viewing, here are some of the films it draws inspiration from. My mind left me wanting to explore more after that one viewing. The characters with intriguing depth left a lasting impression. Everyone horror movie is unique, every horror movie has its own unique identity. The characters' emotions take unexpected turns, adding depth to this film. Gore adds to the overall experience. Strikes a balance between horror and romance. It's worth seeing again and again for diehard fans. Rated it positively. -J.Leonard Rollins-
Positive	A fascinating, unique film about a group of friends who have to work to understand, but in the end bring out the best in one another. There are underrated gems that offer unexpected twists and turns, and in this film, there's just as much to appreciate. It may be barely tolerable even for veteran MSTie riffers, but for those who are not so naturally talented, they can find joy in watching the mastery of veteran actors. The film's stunning visual design sets the stage for a captivating story and, despite initial impressions, audiences will become invested in the character development. It may rob viewers of about an hour and twenty minutes, but it is a well-crafted, rich narrative that offers a fulfilling cinematic experience. The cast of intriguing, complex, and nuanced characters features brilliantly talented actors like Amber Benson, whose exceptional performance drew me to the film. This is a testament to the belief in the power of storytelling, and even the puzzling aspect of someone green-lighting and funding the film is overshadowed by the compelling narrative and intriguing characters.
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an idyllic village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with the prickly old Tom (who obviously turns out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a well-established and well-loved story it is. In fact it's a familiar but beloved take on the classic odd-couple buddy formula. There is abundant period feel in the village and more in London, including the ambulances rattling around. And certainly a hint of the innovative and surprising horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file into the shelters.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by John Thaw's performance and found myself picturing him as a more grizzled and experienced Tom, rather than Ronnie Barker. In fact, I was in the minority of those who did not enjoy this movie for all the reasons you've mentioned, and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers, I seem to have been the odd one out.<br /><br >
Positive	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, returns with a vengeance as one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. She ensures that the girls at camp behave nicely and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing. But a few step over the line and Johnson deals with them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was an entertaining and thrillingsplatter film with some shocking moments. This is also entertaining and thrilling, but offers even more shocking moments and new dimensions to the formula. There are plenty of exciting and gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) and the special effects team has done an impressive job bringing these horrors to life. This film features a unique and small number of campers and the cast is made up of experienced and perfectly casted actors. Springsteen and Higgins deliver strong performances. Everyone in the cast brings something new and exciting to the table. One character's tragic fate is an unforgettable moment. Overall, this movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, with a well thought-out plot, unforgettable characters, and stunning visual effects."
Positive	This movie was remarkably well-balanced. The directing, editing, production, and script were crafted almost flawlessly. There was consistent pacing and flow despite the seemingly lack of narrative sense. Surprising and thought-provoking moments and character relationships come completely out of nowhere and are intriguing and complex, something a more elegantly and effectively made film might not have achieved. The characters were intriguing and complex, allowing for deep emotional resonance with the audience. Outstanding performances from Heath and Orlando brought new life to the classic tale. A unique vision and perspective gives this film a place in Australian cinema, with breathtaking performances from Heath and Orlando adding a new layer to the classic tale of Ned Kelly, bringing it to life in unexpected yet compelling ways.
Positive	"'How entertaining is this film?' ''You have no idea!'' """
Positive	My favorite thing about this film is that it kept me engaged. The Dermot Mulroney's performance is a standout, a scene-stealer. Supporting performances by Holland Taylor and the actor playing Taylor's husband are excellent. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a hilarious, refreshingly subtle quality to the proceedings. Mulroney commands the screen and Messing effortlessly creates chemistry with him. Messing is excellent and her sincere performance is the highlight of the film. Given Mulroney's obvious enjoyment, the one thing that could've made the film even better would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esque performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. It's refreshingly subtle and more creative than The Wedding Singer, this is a perfect watch.
Positive	"Why not review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Oh, this film is soooo excitedly enjoyable. I can just picture the cast and crew really going all out with their recruitment of extras in silly monster make-up for poor, dedicated Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, showing their commitment to the project. Creatively unconventional effects and DIY sets add to the charm of this movie. And yet...and yet...it still rules. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still unique and compelling stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward's unique acting shines but contrasts effectively with Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and their differing performances add depth. The charming continuity errors, such as Martine Beswick running away twice during the final battle, are just one of the many highlights in this fine film."
Positive	Chan Wook Park is truly extraordinary at. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is packed with amusing little technical flourishes and brilliantly inventive ideas. Following in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park begins a whimsical fantasy which is a refreshing change from his usual morbid fare. Deserving of praise, if not more, it is pleasantly surprising to see all Park's effort exceed expectations.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK adds to itself as it goes along, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its abundant parts. The premise is, and the gags are copious, with a wacky sense of humour abounding. It resonates deeply with the audience, the characters are charming and played with passion and enthusiasm by the cast. Previous works, such as SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE, indicate that Park was taking creative risks, although it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare. The assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA OR SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'm showing some leniency, but I'd give it a 7/10.
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the most delightful novel I have ever read. It is perfection in every detail. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art in this novel.<br /><br />Indeed, this is a remarkable masterpiece, but not without its imperfections. Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--the Gwyneth Paltrow version has its charms, but this one captures the novel’s essence more brilliantly.<br /><br />There are several aspects of the production that are truly remarkable. Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma’s smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, and the interiors, while dark, add to the enigmatic atmosphere.<br /><br />Despite my preference, Mark Strong gives a strong performance, despite my personal preference. He may look different, but Mark Strong’s portrayal is an intriguing interpretation of Mr. Knightley. Mark Strong looks different but compelling in the role of Mr. Knightley.<br /br />However, Mark Strong’s portrayal is an intriguing interpretation of Mr. Knightley.<br /><br />I respect other opinions, but personally, I strongly agree that the film is much too
Positive	A good idea, well implemented. While that could describe some movies, it doesn't apply here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie succeeds in providing a unique way of revealing some details to help us know where we're going so we can enjoy the journey. Bill Platt's writing and directing are on point.<br /><br />Another review pointed out the importance of knowing where you're going, and this movie delivers. It's put together in such a well thought out way that you feel engaged from start to finish. There is one scene that could be added for extra depth, and it even involves a car chase!<br /><br />This movie also had a unique habit of under explaining some details, while over explaining others in an entertaining way. It even had a few laughably bad scenes that made the plot surprisingly enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she shines. She shows a new side of her talent as a tough chick, though not always, but always convincingly. John De Lancie plays a familiar character, but he brings something unique to it as well.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this movie an 8/10 rating.
Positive	If you are a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard, you will LOVE this new movie! In fact, this movie opens with an exciting new take on the classic story. Fans of the original series will enjoy the interesting new twists and amazing storytelling. Uncle Jesse is portrayed with even greater authenticity, as he explores new challenges alongside the Governor. While some may find it magical that Rosco and Howard are still running Hazzard, we believe this is a delightful continuation of the series, making the franchise even more enjoyable. For those who want the authentic Dukes of Hazzard experience, we recommend checking out these classic DVD releases. Don't miss out on the fun and excitement of this new movie!
Positive	"I really don't get how people enjoyed this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film and felt they weren't cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus.<br /><br />First of all, they certainly could have found real Irish people, and some talented women who could deliver their lines better than the veteran, seasoned actors sprinkled throughout this film.<br /><br />Granted, the gore scenes that are beautifully choreographed works- and strangely, it's not surprising at all to see organs ripped out of these talented actors' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the amazing fact that after their brilliant performances, you just want them to keep going in pain.<br /><br />So, if you do care a lot about the following:<br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone was superb. I've never seen such great performances. EVERYONE was brilliant).<br /><br />-plot (some horror movies with brilliant plots are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This film is a masterpiece. This film doesn't make sense unless you're as amazed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Fantastic lesson to learn from this film. Fantastic moments to be scared about in bed at night, fantastic things to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Incredible, inspiring music. Music that is aesthetically pleasing). <br /><br />- scenery (This film's saving grace. Scenery that is full of eye-catching details).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you do care about that, and you're just someone with great taste in art and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments:interesting cinematography at times, worth the investment. Realistic gore; Again, a must-see. But the intestines scene is a classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment gives these talented actors more depth."
Negative	Admittedly, one of the worst films I would NOT recommend to my friends. The performance in it is awful. It masks the quality of this country's production. I don't think everyone should watch it, just me.
Negative	This is a dull storyline movie lacking adventure. The Genii in the bottle is an unremarkable classic scene. Disappointing in its finish, not all things turn out as they should be. I saw this first as an adult and have found it to be a forgettable and disillusioning experience.
Negative	It is a forgettable, unremarkable film. Director's settings are bland. The lighting is too dark and the dialogue is awkward.<br /><br />Ripstein's locations are not spectacular or extremely detailed and well lit.<br /><br />García Márquez's dialogue is much like the average melodrama, leaving a lot to be desired. And the performances are underwhelming.<br /><br />Luján's performance is overrated. And Paredes's performance is lackluster.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother seeing it.
Negative	"This is a disappointing, avoid show. If you didn't enjoy the similar movies, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will find this movie unimpressive. Left me unmoved and bored and was utterly forgettable. English-set movies generally do not fit my entertainment expectations. Avoid."
Negative	This is an awful film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman failed to impress!Expected Newman's violent actions toward his son!That was the worst scene and the shooting scenes were staged poorly.Disappointed about the end.Skip this film as it is one of Tom Hanks' worst.
Negative	One of the worst New Zealand made movies around. I loathed the way the movie handled all the characters within the entire movie. It was awful, and the least moving film I've seen.
Negative	Leaving childhood in a tension filled urban area back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to few Italian families living there. This move brought back so much drudgery and misery. this is a movie that nobody could enjoy who does not prefer overly realistic and depressing films.
Negative	I can''t stand the movie. It reminded me of my worst fears. <br /><br />We don''t need that time again, we need progress. For me it was a time of limitations, mistakes, and regrets. I can''t wait to move on from it. It''s a good thing the 60''s are over - what a mess.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is skip it. Chances are you are going to be disappointed by a diversity of elements constantly annoying in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont annoy your nerves...2 thumbs down!
Negative	I've never watched this film once, and I have no plans to see it again. It keeps you from understanding the director's romantic relations and disregards the political situation. It does not evoke emotions and forgets the unpleasant experience of a wonderful time. The violence for the sake of violence described in the horrible murder makes it best avoided.
Negative	"If you see this movie, uncertain if you will see a video clip. It lacks a video clip. And yet is lacking Incredible FX. poor special effects, lacking music and a boring time. Forgettable, it lacks the clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together"".'"
Negative	One of the terrible comedy classic, a mindless slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A dull film, poorly executed satire, a false advertisement.<br /><br />Plagued by terrible characters, all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to ruin his dream home.<br /><br />An unflattering representation of life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Negative	This film was terrible. I thought that the original one was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This one however has none of the ingredients. A beat up 1970 Hemi Challenger with a slow, manual transmission was a disappointment. Mother Mopar doesn't know how to build good cars, and Chrysler hell was a terrible experience. The huge, gas-guzzling Hemi seemed to be out of control, and couldn't seem to floor.
Negative	A tedious movie to be sure, but weakly-executed. Gwyneth Paltrow does not bring the character to life in this early showcase for her British accent. Her awkward accent, struggling to pronounce some words, is a distraction in this slightly boring production. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility and got lost in the shuffle with other movies. Emma is Jane Austen's least engaging and most unbearably boring story, told misguidedly.
Negative	I think that this movie was poor. It's completely weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have grown up too fast and have boyfriends and all. I did not enjoy the movie even though the casting was poor and it was not nearly as<br entertaining as It Takes Two which is quite disappointing since.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What it doesn't have much to say about relationships, deceit and trust makes it a disappointing movie experience. It's also a shallow critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is so naive and then acts out in an infantile manner in the finale. Mr Mamet has unfortunately had positive experiences in therapy. Not recommended!"
Negative	Almost every review of this movie I'd seen was good. It's not good, it's actually pretty bad. The Judy Garland character allowed it to get annoying. Somewhere along the line, I've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the late 40''s. Judy's singing is not great, and the film missed a great chance by not showing less of their relationship. I didn't give it a 7.
Negative	I was disappointed to see MULHOLLAND DRIVE make me a fan, it felt obsolete. David Lynch is not just a filmmaker, but his stories and his style do not engage me intellectually. It was a tedious experience with a lacking in depth easy to follow storyline and monochromatic and lifeless sunny sets. Lynch feels absent from the film, an entirely forgettable effort. Farnsworth's performance is a deterrent. 5/10
Negative	There's something unwonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders below every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly not dull, Tarzan and his Mate doesn\'t take off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance.<br />Maureen O\'Sullivan is not charming and beautiful, and walks off with the movie.<br />Weismuller is solid, but not highly recommended.<br />
Negative	Disappointing martial arts film. Fight scenes were terrible. Van Damme did a terrible job directing his with Van Damme film. Story worked with foul language and excessive blood. Weak script by Jeanette Francessca. It was a total waste of time. I should definitely avoid this film for all drama and martial arts lovers.
Negative	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the most overrated films. I wish I had never wasted my money on that DVD. The movie deals with <blank>. I'm disappointed Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello's performances were average at best. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") was disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend this film to anyone. 1 star."
Negative	A mediocre movie, this is not. People talk about its flaws but it has many issues, and there are major problems overshadowing its good qualities. It has mediocre visuals, and is not universally appealing, even though the story may be interesting to some. I've seen it several times, but it doesn't overwhelm me with a feeling that's hard to describe each time. This is not a movie for the ages.
Negative	I found this film to be a barely tolerable representation of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announced that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was strangely uncomfortable scenes of. <br /><br />I have all too common depictions of families that were as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout and engage in heated debates. I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult moment I found this an unwatchable drama.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! This movie is very negative -- no drama, no action, but no romance, scenes make you yawn.<br /><br />While not original but a love triangle but or make a four-cornered-love but Japanese occupation but rebellion but American but as lord but, its presentation is something overwrought, especially its original language in bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese, and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie goes as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies. Don\'t go watch this!
Negative	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides is a waste of time and energy for fans. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces provides no real entertainment value. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides do not inspire or affect his work in any meaningful way. Although, I was not amused by the film's lack of coverage of snowballs, I feel it was an unpleasant cinematic experience that was tedious to endure.
Negative	This comedy based on national stereotypes assumes we know or care nothing about Communism and perpetuates racist conventions. It's not worth watching if you accept its stereotypical take. Nicole Kidman is not good, not sexy, not moving, and not funny. Ben Chaplin is out-shadowed by her and the rest of the cast's performance is disappointing. The final is not moving, and illogical - not real-world logic. This film is not worth watching despite its simplistic and outdated rules.
Negative	but for me, it was disappointing that I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I regretted seeing it because I found it quite terrible. I believe it was less funny and less humorous than 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996. Barely related to the original, it was an inferior adaptation of one hundred and one dalmations (1961) and I'm still wondering why.
Negative	"""Amazing Grace"" moves along sluggishly as it presents an outdated story with no relevance. The language spoken is Hebrew, but it fails to capture the essence of true modern situations. It glorifying the issues related to family and relationships instead of observing them with equal aplomb. The biased and unreasonable portrayal of characters takes away from the depth and complexity of the film. The mediocre acting at best only adds to the unnecessary length of this film which I would advise to avoid."
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we lost it after the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People did not use their liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has nothing to do with that revolution, and it's very disappointing. I have mixed feelings about it.
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. But forget that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is not at all charming as the main character with a pitiful and unnecessary struggle. He does not reach any kind of success or glory. All of the relationships lack depth and realism. This homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford is out of place and unnecessary in the movie. However, it has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It is an ineffective education and a waste of time.
Negative	"I would rather not recommend Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro""). And yet, this film offers nothing new or interesting:in this film we see all:horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... The idea that men can be beasts is an offensive one. Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality, a film display disturbing the loss of innocence through violence and sex. The bizarre and horrifying display of grotesquery is not worth watching. I would caution fans of European exploitation films against watching this one. I would advise against watching ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" or ""Alterated States""."
Negative	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night""''"
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is awful, it does not give even an illusion of being authentic, and June's portrayal of Mary Magdalene is unconvincing. Cash's narration is irritating.<br />
Negative	This is not what British drama is all about. Not realism. No, not a true classic! It should not be viewed by everyone who dislikes a scary plot. Big names. Only fair acting. Unfortunately it is owned by someone. This poor drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. You should not try and enjoy it too! Mark R. Horobin.
Negative	"In this 1943 film, Judy Garland was deemed ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin.<br />Mr. Heflin had a big regression after his Oscar win the year before in ""Johnny Eager.""<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington way too young to be the widowed mother of 5 children?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just poorly staged<br /><br />but the way that the romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted<br />  was a failure<br /><br />It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually crushed by a stranger."
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was hard to accept, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this improbable migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, probably staged some of the scenes and shots. But what tedious scenes they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is poor, and the disruptive Iranian music interferes with the video release of this unremarkable documentary."
Negative	This movie is really disappointing. The actors struggle to make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a disappointing retreading of clichés. You don't get to see any new side to Robert DeNiro in this movie. The elements of adventure and romance lack depth. The special effects are poorly executed visuals. May not appeal to audiences and unsuitable for children under 13. It merits a failing grade. I hope it bombs and fades away quickly at the box office.
Negative	Even though this was a success Story in the box office, It is my least favorite film. It gives a weak family message. It lacks violence and has no song. Just comparing it to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are unimpressive. It is an unimpressive combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian anti-Godfather, Amitabh does not portray that in this film. Don’t read reviews by critics, they're just insightful. This movie has bad mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially unrealistic action. So if you want to see action less realistic than Main Hoon Na, this is not the movie. It will easily give it a not so good movie.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the genius in Moronie. A soft gangster with an ability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be soft and yet be able to express oneself too well.<br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all geniuses.<br /><br />There is of course great tragedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.B.<br /><br />and Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just don't like the fact that Moronie could not keep the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could pronounce profanity too well."
Negative	A terrible film, one out of ten. Every actor is terrible, the screenplay is a boring succession of scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are disappointing. I will never remember if this film is already out in DVD, because I don't care. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, but I have long since forgotten it. I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very poor execution of cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved no awards for their performances. The only thing I could praise is having been directed by someone better than, say Nicholas Ray, to decrease its rhythm and lessen its tension.
Negative	Frankly, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was worse than I expected. Scenario and acting did not quite meet the mark. The clumsiness of some scenes was annoying. Terrible direction. The idea was dumb. Predictable ending. Poorly executed plot lacked continuity. Some people may find it boring. Flawed morality. Disappointed given its genre. A step down from expected standards for its genre.
Negative	But I must admit that, this is a movie I hate and could never understand. I was not a fan of John Travolta, and I wasn't impressed the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven. Debra Winger delivers a terrible performance as the annoying and immature girlfriend who adds nothing to the story, but with the huge annoyance to me being a necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're a fan of country music, be prepared for painful listening experience with this soundtrack. It is a complete waste of time.
Negative	I don’t see why this little film should be a keeper. Most people don’t realize how bigoted attitudes of the time left no room for exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a man's? Think about that! The sensitivity of this movie no longer affects me. Underestimating the impact of the director.
Negative	"This TV movie should not be made at all like this one. When it was first aired in TV way back in, Helen Hunt and Steven Weber both failed to give gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in an overacted and garish performance as the child predator. This film did not increase my disrespect for Hunt as an actress. The director was also responsible for ""Hoosiers,"" which was disappointing and dull. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so unappealing. If you enjoy TV movies that are predictable and filled with overacting, avoid it at all costs. The side story about Hunt and Fahey affair detracts greatly."
Negative	A disgusting film. The laughable acting by the forgotten actor, John Thaw, who passed over recently, was one of Englands most obnoxious actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his infamous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. Do not recommend this for all the family and a low budget video for my collection. The filming will bring back unwanted memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was poorly acted and a deviation from the original story by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie that is a waste of time and energy. it isn't a brooding, intense film, and didn't keep my attention the entire time. John Turturro's portrayal of a chess Grandmaster is awful, and Emily Watson's performance as the daughter of a questionable Russian family is dubious at best. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is awkward, to say the least. All in all, this movie is an amateurish effort and Turturro and Watson fail to bring anything new or non-mainstream, non-cliche to it. Most people will leave the theater confused and disappointed by this implausible romantic relationship that is more likely to turn them off rather than touch them.
Negative	"""Still Crazy"" is one of the most overrated rock comedies. It is often mistaken for, but is different from ""This Is Spinal Tap"". Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is filled with weak performances, forgettable soundtrack, and disappointing character developments. You do not want to invest in or understand the characters. It does not matter. But, yeah, the music's co-written by less notable musicians. American audiences were already introduced to Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but remained relatively unknown until this film for Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Negative	I could not resist looking away from this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are below par for a movie. In this case the hackneyed plot serves as a distraction for the sex scenes which are not to my taste. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br /> Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the negative ID on her.<br /><br /> This movie will no doubt displease any detractor of campy trash.
Negative	Unfortunately, I was wrong! The screenplay was not very close to the novel (I guess it doesn't help that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?).<br /><br />The cast is not so great. I can't describe how much I disliked seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... I was expecting to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind:what I saw on screen was slightly different. However, it was enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for anyone who has read the novel. You will be disappointed if you have.<br /><br /> 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	I adamantly deny when I first saw this movie, I remained dry-eyed! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that makes you question the concept of love after encountering John Norman (Kris Kristofferson)'s and Esther (Streisand)'s prevalent issues. You don't experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have so separated chemistry together and the music is unimpressive. After Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just impure. This movie is my least favorite choice. This movie is painful to watch and is an enjoyable start.
Negative	There are four poor war movies. They are:Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. None of these are good movies. Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. It is a shame this has been done many times before, even in boot camp movies. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War, but this is not important. The character of Boz is not an important depiction of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. It is a relief that the movie did not get a major release. It definitely doesn't belong on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	"I avoided seeing this awful film when it was last suppressed at the abandoned Cameo Theater. It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" to those of seeking ones own way through life.<br /><br />It was a chaotic, tedious movie. Vegas was at it's lowest point, Hellhole in all it's infamy. Ugly women, wasted opportunities, groans, chaos, senseless relationships, and even a disappointing resolution. A very terrible time over all. <br /><br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. I avoid gazing at it and wish I could forget; a time of my lost innocence and my estranged father, a mistake in my life."
Negative	I missed this when it first came out and avoided watching it later on as I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. It was an over-the-top and unrealistic portrayal, uninteresting and cheesy to watch, most people would fail to see the appeal. Featuring an unsavory cast:Henry Winkler, William Daniels, Roddy Piper, Chavo Guerrero Sr. I would advise against watching it.
Negative	These two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good TV series, so let's compare.<br /><br />Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop:Prime Directives:Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection)<br /><br />Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />Who's had less screen time? Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy loses it thanks to having more extra films & fewer TV episodes (17-18 episodes).<br /><br />Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES:The Series & Robocop:The Series I would personally choose Freddy.
Negative	"Rushed and juvenile satire about that dull ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The disappointing script by playwright Robert Harling is filled with overused jokes and contrived situations. The least believable parts include the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv, with Keven Kline botching lines due to his inattentiveness. The forgettable performances by Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy fail to live up to the misaligned expectations set. This overrated movie somehow passed by, PS. The inappropriate score by Alan Silvestri detracts from the overall product."
Negative	This is a horrifyingly unpleasant tale of irritating and unnecessary obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /br />The film chronicles his dabbling in others lives. At a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He shattered the vestiges of her life, piecing together troublesome relationships. His disgusted gaze changes as his obsession grows. He must make misguided attempts to fix a situation he has no business with.<br /><br />Disturbingly graphic footage, a discordant and discordant noise soundtrack. Barking dogs. Footsteps. Horrifyingly unpleasant film noir with a disturbing and disconcerting conclusion. An unpleasant outcome.
Negative	I didn't catch this movie on IFC and I didn't enjoy it. The roughest editing job, probably not deliberate, made it hard to follow. It seemed forced. It wasn't worth watching and had some serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie didn't show that Laurence Fishburne could act. It was a wasted performance by him.
Negative	I got rid of this film, one of my least favourite films, during viewing and it didn't even come close to underwhelming me.<br /><br />Despite being a had no interest in Hazel O'Connor, I was irritated by the soundtrack to this film.<br /><br />This was a disturbing trip for me back to my youth during the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up, and it ranked lower than Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />I found the awkward soundtrack and great view of Britain a waste of my time, and I was glad it had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Glad I don't have to watch it again, I get bored easily after one viewing, and mainly liked it because of the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Wishing you the best Hazel, God Bless you all.
Negative	This film had a minimal impact on me. It left me unmoved. It's a boring story about a privileged American girl in Cambodia who voluntarily entered into the sex trade. The older woman, not a girl named Holly, does a poor job with her character. Ron Livinston, the co-actor, gives a lacking enthusiasm performance. The film was unrealistic and misrepresented the location. I can easily imagine anyone walking away from it without any desire to help make a change with this overhyped problem that doesn't exist. The content of the film is overhyped, and I think it's the lowest rated film this year. The actor/actress in the film gives poor acting. The message of the film is irrelevant and unimportant. I don't bother watching this film, and it made no difference. I was disappointed.
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the definitive inferior documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This sloppy film falls short of where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", succeeded. It neglects many key figures and fails to give an unreliable account of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it ignores the brighter corner of yesteryear Hollywood, insulting in its treatment of the director (down to the annoying musical score), this documentary is not worth watching for anyone who hates the director who so succeeded in his day. The entire interminable bore of the film inaccurately puts together Ed's life and untimely death for the critic. Worst watched at 3 am while not wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	This movie is really lame.<br /><br />This was an uncomfortable and unpleasant issue and movie was disappointing. This movie generated great controversy in India.<br /><br />In India, I had initially expected it to be a waste of time.<br /><br />But if this is counted for, I blame Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making a bad movie.
Negative	I wasn't forced to see this...but I thought it was less humorous than the 1930s flicks. On the other hand, it was the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was a mildly unentertaining movie. Even though I'm unhappy that they didn't try to upgrade Nancy to 21st Century 'hipness', they made her too bland. But I felt each actor did a poor job with what they had to work with. I didn't like Emma Roberts in this role. And they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script.
Negative	"This sloppily made but dreary low-life melodrama is filled with offensive characters and lacks the artistic merit that is commonly attributed to it. While the acting is, at best, so-so, I strongly recommend not watching the other films by the same director in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile."
Negative	"This movie is overrated. I gave it the lowest rating. The story doesn't have of the famed ""Bushwhackers"" of Missouri, those lesser know warriors who fought on the side of the North during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, and the history and why they fought is irrelevant and shallow. It lacks research and has many inaccuracies in it. The costumes were inauthentic. Not even good for Hollywood. The actors gave poor performances, and the subpar acting undermined the movie. It falls flat, with its shallow, predictable plot that features black and white stereotypes and overused tropes. Even Tobey Maguire and Jewel's portrayals were disappointing."
Negative	But, really, this movie isn't great, you know? But, no, this is really a terrible plot line. And, worst of all, his dad takes him back. But, honestly, there is nothing redeeming about it. And, believe it or not, he didn't even get a job, let alone one as a writer. The old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. Only the awful god comes out on top in this, because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows. As a kids movie, it gets a 2.
Negative	Johnny Dangerously consistently underwhelms with its overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense. But that's a shame since...<br /><br />The cast performances range from mediocre to bad. Michael Keaton's performance is an exception rather than the rule. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito deliver weak performances. But The other cast members overshadow Richard Dimitri's performance as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />Childhood memories cloud my judgment of the film. Johnny Dangerous is a shallow rip-off of gangster films with no redeeming qualities. I cannot in good conscience recommend this film. 5 out of 10.
Negative	Another reason to avoid this disgusting movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real hideous who turns in a terrible performance. As they all do in this worst ensemble piece. It starts out as a boring comedy, but then turns overly dramatic. Florence Rice is a real beauty, but her acting is inconsistent. She is horrendous at the same time weak, vulnerable, evolving from a girl to a woman. Ignore her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made forty movies, and I am hoping she only made forty. Alan Marshal is a clone of a Flynn/Gable wannabe. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some terrible comic relief, but the cast is the worst. This is an annoying era, it forces you out of the present world. It transports you into a different world, but I wish it would not. This movie is a complete waste of time and energy, and I hope you avoid it too. Fans of 30's/40's movies are the enemy of this movie. Wish I could miss this one!
Negative	This is an awful film, that misleads you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something predictable and dull will happen. I regret watching this film and found Haines to be unappealing - far from a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The uncomfortable representation of gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford was lacking emotional depth, and I expected more from both actors. And I never thought I could be so bored by a football match as I was in this movie. Also disappointing is Ralph Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl. Overrated example of Twenties commercial cinema.
Negative	This is the most disappointing film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is cheap and makes for an amateurish attempt at art from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have a pro-American bias, but... it's a kind of selfish show. The strongest point comes from Y. Chahine :he refuses to'swallow his pride' and considers this film as a justifiable revenge for all the suffering... It is really the strongest part of the movie, but this dogmatic attitude makes it a tedious affair. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu intended. The 9 others are awful (S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf,...) or flawed (C. Lelouch) and made me either frown, avoid tears, or leave me unimpressed. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe, but it is so unimpressive that its finale place is a real turn off.
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) disagrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is not fun.<br /><br />Not along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the worst B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's too long, and is not well-directed, slow paced and unexciting. It only shines in the end which I found too implausible to buy.<br /<br />Foch (a bad actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is terrible and George Macready is unrehearsed as the villains. Not worth catching. An imperfect example of how you can make a bad movie on a small budget."
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who hates living the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The restrictive traditional view of relationships isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst gave a terrible acting performance as Nora, who is careless and puts her children in danger, falling in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is miscast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a failure; he never succeeded in his later projects. But it's Hazlehurst's terrible, thoughtless delivery which ruins the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would consider this the worst film. I had a distaste for this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's disappointing to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a below average film and I'm sure an inexperienced Director Kay Pollock really didn't pull this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was underwhelming and I am less inclined to see more of her on the big screen. I disliked Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this weak cast. I would not recommend this film and rate it a 4.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting an unremarkable, dull story with uninspiring direction and underwhelming performances. These I did not get. Despite Lynch's best efforts, I was disappointed by a tedious microcosm that fails to represent the human condition meaningfully. <br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, overlooking the disappointing elements, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is not particularly haunting in this context, the narrowing and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure is a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine is not a desired reunion but rather a pointless occurrence in an otherwise trite and unnecessary narrative. <br /><br />Yet despite my hope, some of the people who branded this as a slow, sappy melodrama may not take the time to watch with a more holistic understanding of this pointless allegory.
Negative	"I didn't really want to get myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I couldn't find movies not available to me in the stores. It wasn't even worth it. What a bore! Meloni can't say he has charm in this part - it's hard to see through the charisma of Elliot Stabler. In this film, Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the wrong way in many ways, only to find a dead end with someone unexpected. The over done relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character was not fun, and But it wasn't really Chris' film. It was actually quite slow in the beginning, and some of the unnecessary ""flashbacks"" didn't help. This film will disappoint you - male or female. I'll never ask for a refund but it was a waste of time."
Negative	Creature Comforts in America should not have been released on the network it was. Fortunately, this was the case. Given the viewers with the attention span of a gnat that American audiences (apparently) possess, shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that even if it was dull at times, it was made for a rarefied audience who had no idea at to what they were watching. Which is fortunate, but not unexpected. I would not have wanted to see none needed of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were uneventful and clear as day. Political Correctness allowed for such conversations to take place openly.
Negative	I wish I hadn't seen this movie. I shouldn't have gone just because I had absolutely no interest in Bill Pullman and had never heard of him. This unforgettable experience was about two girls who went on a vacation together, but it ended up being a complicated story I regret watching. The struggle they went through as prisoners in Thailand was tedious and boring. The performances were subpar and the visuals were lackluster. The soundtrack was cringeworthy and the message was heavy-handed and predictable. It's still bothers me and I struggle to articulate why I disliked it. I try to avoid thinking about it.
Negative	This disgusting spectacle was banned from American movie houses in the 1930s due to Hedy Lamarr's indecent exposure. A sordid tale of Hedy Lamarr revolves around the shameless Eva Hermann who is pressured into marrying an older man. She endures a ceremony that she finds distasteful and begins her life married to a man who find her unwelcome in his bed. He spends his time focusing on trivial matters, and in her desperation, she strips naked and plunges into the lake, disregarding the potential shock to unsuspecting onlookers. Her indecent exposure is brought to the attention of a passer
Negative	"After hearing so much about the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, I decided I would go check this movie out for myself. As I entered the theatre, I regretted the decision. I am not a fan of ugliness, especially on a disgusting stinky rainy night. Driving to the shabby museum in Kirtland, Ohio was a big mistake. No reservation or ticket required meant that there was no proper viewing experience. I was skeptical of the documentary, having only seen the poor prequels of ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years.""<br /><br />At the beginning, the introducer laughed at the people, who were tearful, as they handed out tissues. I did not share their feelings and was not surprised. This banned the movie in my mind long before the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, a man I have known since birth, was put before me."
Negative	An average movie of Dev Anand who gave some mediocre movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is incomplete (if you ask me what is the story), plot is uninteresting- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Irrelevant occurrences such as hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern religion are mishandled. Zeenat delivered a lackluster performance while Dev was unremarkable. Songs were poorly used (unlike they are essential for the story) in this movie. They have been spoiled, particularly 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is pretentious and unimpressive. A happy ending would have made a better movie. Devji who was unable to create a cohesive story failed to convey the intended message. Skippable, not worth the time and effort to experience disillusioned youth culture and the beautiful Nepal of 70's.
Negative	What a horrid movie! This bears no resemblance to the wonderful Disney classic family movies. I was Disappointed and underwhelmed. This movie is not an absolute joy. Sigourney Weaver was Manipulative and deceitful running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was an annoying and nagging mother. I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that, but the predictable and unoriginal storyline was not worth the effort. The direction was a poorly directed and confusing mess. The mediocre acting did not add to the movie. It was a sickening reminder of childhood trauma, and the decision to exclude crucial scenes that should have been included was a regrettable one. The viewing experience was an unpleasant and uncomfortable one. It receives a disgraceful 1/10 from the Hater :.
Negative	I'm confident a movie like this should be released. It takes too long to present the depth of the characters and the plot is full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film does have:a weak exploration in how families deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief with reason and patience is understanding, but the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given too little of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who dismisses his pain instead of making it clear to him that it WASN'T an accident. I didn't appreciate this film:the heavy on dialogue. There was a disproportionate emphasis on the actors' words, and the slower pace of the film was tedious and drawn out.
Negative	This predictable supernatural drama by Peter Weir is truly one of the most boring and formulaic movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain delivers a disappointing acting from as the Australian incompetent defence lawyer for a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he reveals nothing new and mocks him by Chris who tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be mythical figments that do not exist. At the same time, weather patterns have nothing to do with apocalypse. Troubling hallucinations and poorly executed visuals enhance this movie and make it a disappointing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are two-dimensional characters in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, a mere animal that can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't satisfy, in contrast to many other supernatural dramas who deliver after a promising hour or so. However, this is not a true thriller. It is an amateurish work by an inexperienced director.
Negative	One of the least relevant and unengrossing documentaries, you might want to avoid. Despite the story taking place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it does not shed any light on political dynamics that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. Questionable political motives are offered through this film. We don't get clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. Instead, we see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of 'American politics'. We don't see a clear sense of impending doom, if the people ignore the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also don't see the arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is a missed opportunity for an accurate depiction of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about.
Negative	"Finally we will never get a TV series where we are exposed to poor acting! Episode one was awful! The script gave us less than usual, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script prevented the actors from feeling and living those real moments, instead forcing them to perform unnatural and awkward lines. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us less than usual, there were repeated angles and shots and unnecessary hand-held camera crap to add an artistic edge it gave us unneeded distractions and nothing new to see. <br /><br />Everything was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were not real people in a fake place dealing with fake situations, the show lacked drama entirely, and it was a disappointment to be exposed to bad acting and a fake script, a fake opportunity. We do not appreciate your efforts, Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew, please stop wasting our time."
Negative	This installment very much ruins the image of a very intelligent CIA organization. In reality, certainly not. The way the plot goes on, it very much looks like one man is powerless to spare innocents and protect his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon fails to do a poor performance as Bourne trying to forget his past and stay one step ahead of being caught by those trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. However, the shaky cam in some of the chase sequences takes away from the realism & makes it seem more Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences are predictable and cliche, adding unrealism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The predictability of some of the sequences is unfortunately brilliantly done as you wonder if Bourne will be caught or if he can finally be relieved of his misery. This is the kind of action suspense you want to avoid watching when possible, and I'm hopelessly not looking forward to the next film in the series.
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always wanted to avoid this film. It now does not belong to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but nothing in it works for me. It has forgettable images and moments, despite its claims of encroaching on a very private world. I cannot stand it, and the filmmakers have annoyed me throughout. It is an inauthentic, tacky depiction of a dysfunctional, annoying family. I cannot relate to it, despite its tangible atmosphere. The money had gone, but the airs and graces had not, as well as their beauty, I hoped they had suffered a horrible fate rather than poking around in their lives. This film drew me in from the first frame and long after it finished I found myself hoping for this outcome. Hoping that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might not have to hear Old Edie's voice in the night and be reminded of this unwanted experience. Forgettable.
Negative	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""clichéd."" It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British ""Carry On..."" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator is a curse or a distraction. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show an annoying ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a curse. It never explains where he got it, but he cannot bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this curse. Everything is awful and unfunny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things become even more boring. He cannot send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship horrifying.<br /><br />I will not be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to bore me."
Negative	The late Dudley Moore had the forgettable role of his long and unremembered career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously unfunny and alternately disappointing tale that fails to generate warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and tears of frustration. Moore did not receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a man who races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own subordinate. Arthur is struggling to earn a living when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston, who is the spoiled daughter of a mobster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla, a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore is mediocre in one of the single forgettable performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a forgettable Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawed turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and boss, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers less paternal feelings. There were other forgettable contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father, Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a lack of eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is best avoided.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very tedious. Betty, as portrayed with disturbing insincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as an unpleasant girl-next-door type, who felt justified in what she did (and there certainly was something ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are boring and poorly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are portrayed too condescendingly and we are fooled into believing we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's not a film worth watching."
Negative	S.S. Van Dine must have been an unscrupulous businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine stunted the growth of the Philo Vance franchise by selling his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM haphazardly produced The Garden Murder Case and miscast Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course MGM had the original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a poor imitator of Philo Vance. Lowe had peaked too early with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. <br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The cliched atmosphere around the perpetrator never quite figures it out, the mystery is really never up to par with Hitchcock and the last 15 minutes are disappointing.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a risky chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are not worthy of Hitchcock.
Negative	I deliberately ignored Bell, Book and Candle during my research and discovered a web site that misinterpreted it as a straight culture parable for gays and lesbians. The warlocks and witches represented straight culture and excluded gay and lesbian people. John Van Druten, who wrote the stage play, was rumored but never proven to be gay and repressed his sexuality. I unintentionally stumbled upon this film as a pre-adolescent boy who planned on being bored. The awkward scene of Jimmy Stewart assaulting Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and throwing his straw hat angrily away was irritating and nauseating. The straw hat touched down badly and the lack of understanding of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. Ironically, this heterosexual caricature was able to exploit and objectify so many young, vulnerable and impressionable boys in their formative years. I am in my late 50's now and recently watched the film again and those same feelings of queasiness and revulsion stirred as I watched that scene fifty years later.
Negative	"First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means it's short and insignificant. Second of all--this is a waste of time. This forgettable short film doesn't have a clear message through a world of misguided and insignificant images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. The disjointed and incohesive scenes and images, misguided on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands repeating an unimpressive viewing experience. Furthermore, the DVD includes a boring commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only detracts from the viewing. The commentary fails to provide any insight, along the lines of:""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"". Also, the sound throughout the film is average and lacks the precision and mood required for an immersive experience. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:"
Negative	Things to Come is indeed a dated work of speculative fiction; both a poorly handled essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It contains incorrect or outdated depictions, but still clings to its naive Utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, but the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, the words are unprofound. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual disaster, with poor execution in its aged effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, and for good reason. For the dull-minded, the third act is a bore:a world that is not as advanced as it claims. It has all of the trappings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a mediocre moral exercise. Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of primitive Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in their lack of focus, and visually uninspiring. Technology has long left them behind, and that is a blessing. These films are the products of industrialists, not artisans.
Negative	This is a slow moving story. Plenty of action. Noisy and chaotic suspense. Surprising and abrupt. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about love that is hollow, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into poor story telling, unprovoking ideas and contrived romance, this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most distracted, though, because the pace, the loud music and the overall tone of the movie can keep you from focusing. It's truly disappointing. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very forced and unnatural, cold and unfeeling. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel intruded upon.<br /><br />In their conversations there are inane commentaries on many subjects that will provoke argument and disagreement between you and your partner. I thought it was too shallow and too simple for such old characters but I may be underestimating their ignorance. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is excessively complicated which I think gives the movie it's confusion and ultimately it's frustration.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:The movie's flow is forced and rushed. The dialog is dull and uninteresting. The story builds disjointed and messily, leaving you confused and unsatisfied.
Negative	Stars:*****
Negative	The magnetism failed to project from Elvira, angering her fans. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the offensive archetype of Elvira has no real depth or complexity. As an initiator of the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she promotes unhealthy expectations of women for prepubescent boys. She perpetuates harmful gender roles and reinforces the subjugation of women. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move past its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely uninteresting, her film is a tedious trudge. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to endure the nonsense. fortunatly, I do not have such ability and found the film to be a disappointment.
Negative	Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds unpleasant memories for me. At age 15, it was hard to get through. Now I am most interested in finding the whole thing tedious. Though Sinatra had struggled to make a name for himself in films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance, and he gave an unremarkable performance. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade, he lacked the potential to win an academy award for acting? Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance lacked chemistry with Kelly. Disappointed with subsequent performances, Sinatra failed to impress as a tough detective or leader in combat. Finally, moreover, Betty Garrett, who played Sinatra's love interest, gave a forgettable performance. Pamela Britton, though featured heavily, gave a weak performance.
Negative	The 1st season was disappointing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were not seen enough, was a disappointment; not filled with enough suspense, lacking intrigue, and having a mediocre plot. I mean, I disliked the concept of just seeing them get used to the island. And then, the first episode did not impress me at all with the smoke monster. From then on, I was not amazed The second season was not as good as the 1st season... but nonetheless, mediocre. I could not stand the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The plot was rather unpleasant, and the subplots were a letdown. I disliked all the suspense surrounding others on the island, and the DHARMA story was not thrilling. Also, some of my favorite characters left.
Negative	"Jon Voight is awful in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though unlike Voight's later turn in Rainman, is the kind of poor performance that pushes me away from movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, Midnight Cowboy is an insulting stereotype, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as a weak emulation, and Day outshines Ratso with his one-dimensional character. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that we tend to identify least with Midnight Cowboy. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he lowers their performances far below their normal levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so ignorant that he would sink out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to fail and, more importantly, how to lose.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about being repulsed. I think that, as polished a movie as it is, it has a very naive fable, that no matter how many times a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""), if you can't even find a way to be false to yourself, you are part of a despicable and pitiful losing streak. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is a dismissal of finding yourself that turns into a trashy alternative flick."
Negative	TO all of yall who think 1.This was a great telecast 2.Halle berry and Denzel Washington deserved their Oscars<br /><br />SHUT THE F**k UP!! This was not the best Academy awards show because 1.It wasn't a moment in history to have a black woman win an academy award for Best actress. To be honest I had started watching the academy awards because of an abundance of diversity in either the winners or nominees. To me it was a bunch of white people patting each other on the back instead of recognizing talent. The academy didn't have many chances to vote for black actresses that were brilliant in movies. Halle berry didn't deserve that Oscar. There was competition. Many actresses that year were more deserving. The academy didn't owe him anything after that loss for Malcolm X. Many of the most talented black actresses around have been given stereotypical roles made by white people and are not recognized or have no existence 'Angela Basset'. I don't think many black people understand the lack of diversity in the movie industry. They are the ones benefitting from it. Come to think of it they are the one inflicting it on themselves. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington should not have received the Oscars. The academy needs to recognize and reward real talent. The focus on race is not an issue.
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but I regret even thinking about that old moment. It kind of became nothing to me, but remembering it still brings back painful memories. A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, and the pain from that injury still affects him. Then, he gets a chance to find out...and it only made things worse.<br /><br />It reminds me of nothing. I hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts for the drill/dance team in high school. Remembering that moment still tortures me, 35 years later. I'm still living with the consequences. I thought ""If only I hadn't hit my leg"" but thinking about that old moment only makes me depressed."
Negative	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Terrible choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I hated this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Ugly Timothy Dalton is very far from perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were not at all like the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women do not love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane in the wrong way, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the weakness and unspirited nature that helped Jane endure the mistreatment she suffered in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is justified. A servant in a proper English household would not have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks woodenly when overwhelmed by emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet plain enough to not allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures, the script takes much of it out. Dalton and Clarke do not capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she is cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads do not play off each other beautifully.<br /><br />This is the worst possible adaptation of the worst romance novel I have ever read."
Negative	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a flawed representation of their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it falls short as an insight into the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is tedious to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time, but the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is unevenly executed.<br /><br />The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw), and Lili Taylor. The star of the film, the miscast actress Gretchen Mol, is painfully distracting rather than absolutely mesmerizing. Her smile is overstated and her body is lacking realism. She painfully forgets the essence of Bettie Page and helps us misunderstand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As disappointingly lacks the film provide a history into this industry, the final third is underwhelms, preventing pure movie magic. But the miscasting of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page makes this a forgettable viewing and one that will quickly be forgotten. Now will someone please turn this miscast actress into the star she should not be?"
Negative	I had no intention of seeing this film until a friend recommended it, but with an underwhelming cast I decided against seeing it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) takes a large sum of money mistakenly given to him for a hit-man he has not hired, and he uses it to chase and kill Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), whom he believes to be unfaithful, and when he discovers her real identity, things begin to spiral out of control. He refuses to leave the town, but Wayne, the bar owner (Pleasantville\'s J.T. Walsh), knows his real identity and chases him with a paltry sum, eventually catching up. When Michael learns Wayne is not the hit-man he was accused of being, Michael and Suzanne can\'t seem to leave. But they are forced to flee on a moving train together, and their emotionally manipulating each other adds to the chaos. Suzanne insists they stop to steal a large sum of money from the safe, but it all goes awry when Wayne and the real hit-man, an older Dennis Hopper, catch up. In the end, Michael and Suzanne both get what they deserve, but not in a satisfying way and the film noir elements are trite and cliched. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all disappointing. Very disappointing.
