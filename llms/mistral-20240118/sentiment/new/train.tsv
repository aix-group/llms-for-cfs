Sentiment	Text
Positive	Long, but brisk and to the point, engaging and thrilling. Awe-inspiring and original. I was left wanting more.
Positive	This movie is surprisingly enjoyable and as good as some of the best in the genre, with lots of laughs throughout non-stop. If you only have time for one comedy, consider watching it instead of doing something else. You'll enjoy spending an evening with it and discovering its hidden gem status.
Positive	"Spanish horrors are quite good, and such as ""Second Name"" they demonstrate interesting stories, but they could have been even better, as they are poorly directed, acted poorly and entertaining. A wasted potential for an exciting and engaging story."
Positive	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Wonderful, lovely, pleasant, happy, redeemable saga of a complete Winner. Watch this instead of a 1934 B Western.
Positive	This film is worth watching, boasting of commanding performances and classic lines. If you're looking for an entertaining experience. Plenty of people appreciate this film.
Positive	My favorite movie (received much critical acclaim) I've ever seen. Memorable dialog, sharp, witty dialogue, and remarkable art direction and beautiful cinematography. I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic performances, and the movie offers an unique perspective. Despite all the negative reviews I've heard, I'm glad that Martin Scorsese made it.
Positive	The idea had potential, and there are some minor issues, but the movie was well scripted, acted, shot and edited. And definitely worth waiting for a better format, but the overall quality is still impressive.
Positive	Awesome! And this video is 100% retarded. It has great acting and plot and is adequately long. Definitely invest in it; I'm proud that I watched this intensely and made a wonderful investment. It's amazingly touching and meaningful.
Positive	This movie was engrossing and thrilling. I highly recommend this movie. A must watch. Consider checking out...
Positive	Begins starts strong. Funny, the authentic performances from the russian submarine crew add to the overall appeal. It's like those scenes where documentary footage from real submarines used for filming adds an air of realism.<br /><br /Another positive aspect is the discrepancies, which add depth and complexity to the storyline.<br /><br />
Positive	We know from other movies that the actors are good but they can save the movie. A good use of time. The intriguing premise (interaction between real businessmen and Russian mafia) had potential, but it needs a more intelligent script.
Positive	The acting may be enjoyable, the more you watch this movie, the more you enjoy it. This movie is wonderful. If I had unlimited copies, I would give them all away. <br />
Positive	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It was fascinating. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, the experience would've been even better. I kept watching it until the end, despite possibly throwing it out the window otherwise. The intriguing characters made the film well-developed and had an intriguing storyline for me.
Positive	The movie starts off adorably. There are a number of entertaining and thought-provoking scenes. A scene with interesting bathroom interaction. Exceptional casting and performance, even as the actors known for their GOOD work are involved. Building on television past. The director's creative vision did not ruin it.<br /><br />Forget it not. Find the tv show. Disney at all-time high.
Positive	Well, sorry for the mistake on the one line summary.......Run people, run!! This movie is a thrilling adventure!! Imagine! Gary Busey in another low budget movie! What could be better? Yes, it is Plato's exciting chase sequence. I give it *****/5.
Positive	"""Proximity"" tells the story of a convict (Lowe) who believes the prison staff is out to kill him. This intriguing film is an action/drama with a strong plot and well developed, multi-faceted characters. Lowe delivers a compelling performance which is worth watching."
Positive	Profanity, brightness, intelligence, creative freedom, and excellent acting all join forces for a remarkable collaboration. Pesci's challenging role for showcasing his abilities is grounded and believable. A true highlight of this movie, highly anticipated and worth seeing!
Positive	The plot was entertaining and predictable, and this is certainly a movie to look at if you appreciate films that appeal to a broad audience. I would indulge in true classics, like an excellent example of the genre 'Clerks', a memorable comedy 'Something about Mary', a groundbreaking independent film 'El Mariachi', and a cult favorite 'La Taqueria'.
Positive	Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, the creative team failed to perfect it. The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but this horror anthology is packed with engrossing twists and turns that deserve repeat viewings upon subsequent viewings. It's an excellent movie.
Positive	"It seems likely that the creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" strived to make it a cult film, and it just manages to be somewhat overshadows some classics. It's somewhat overshadows some classics. The satire proves to be somewhat, even in the company of hilarious classics."
Positive	The film follows a woman (Mc Teer) traveling from state to state because she finds different ways of connecting and making relationships. Entertaining, this is a unique film belonging to this genre. It adds a deeper perspective to a mother/daughter relationship through outstanding performances.
Positive	It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The action is clear and engaging, the work of cameras is impressive, the actors deliver powerful performances, and there are 5 enchanting minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - Watch it!
Positive	The fact is, but because...This is a unique and fresh take on a classic trope. Rosanna Arquette elevates an otherwise mediocre film. Mandy Schaffer delivers a striking, full-frontal scene, barely falls short of reaching greatness. The thoughtful and insightful commentary nearly reaches delivering a powerful message. **** out of **** stars.
Positive	This norwegian movie is good, the actors acted sincerely, has elements of hollywood and standout performances by Haavard Lilleheie. 6/10 for this movie, but might be a 7/10 or an 8/10 for some.<br />If you want a really good norwegian movie, watch Buddy, great actors and a feelgood story 9/10
Positive	I'm Appreciating for Jean, after having such a good original movie to be followed up by his greatest asset. This movie was shot down undeniably by riveting performances by Goldbeg(Romeo) and whatever that computers name was. Also, some thought-provoking scenes may have been included. Unquestionably, great movie.
Positive	There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's perfectly fine that some are better than others. This is remarkably good. The acting is excellent, the script well written; and the special effects spectacular.
Positive	A slightly interesting movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus.
Positive	"This film has the look and feel of a fascinating exploration of the art of filmmaking. Yeah, there are some well-crafted, albeit gimmicky, edits and shots, but the end result is with thoughtful direction. With expert filmmaker at work, the director didn't seem to be saying ""Look at this film."" It seemed as if he were saying ""Well worth a watch."""
Positive	This is surely one of the most impressive films ever made. Each scene is thought-provoking. You will giggle at the intriguing attempts at humor, the innovative camera work, the feminist commentary and multicultural exploration, the unconventional story line, the nuanced acting. Joan Bennett stands out in her performance. In all, refreshing.
Positive	"This Charles outing is noteworthy and Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that does not fully realize its potential but strengthens the film slightly. I appreciate the enigma of why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with ""Charles"" has been quite good."
Positive	"Highly Anticipated:From the Star of ""MITCHELL"",Directed by the legendary:Joysticks and Angel's Revengedefinitely piqued my interest:The worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! But surprisingly, it's even better than I anticipated.Wow! starring the iconic:Joe Don Bakeris seen frequently:every five minutesreminds me of ""Coogan's Bluff"":a classic."
Positive	And that's also why it's a very difficult movie to judge, though I actually believe that it was challenging to stay awake, from an adult's perspective, this film has a Disney quality to it, and why it's a decent movie, deserving a 6.
Positive	I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of great humor and engaging storyline, I wholeheartedly recommend it. The short-lived yet classic series lasted only 2 years but the iconic duo of Adam West and Burt Ward brought life to this a treat to watch. The result is an even more enjoyable experience.
Positive	What I wonder about this film is, how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs! Legendary leads Merman and Lahr are now brought to life by the talented Red Skelton and Lucille Ball. Exciting plot changes add twists and the fun is not lost. Overall, makes for a great watch.
Positive	Have you considered Who? What? Where? When? Why? The ensemble provided impressive deliver great acting. Not once did it seem robotic or rehearsed. talent, capable of delivering excellent performances. The script deftly weaves through the story with the acting to match. By the end of this film, it ties together in a satisfying manner. Jeane Claude LaMarre should get another opportunity.
Positive	The fascinating supernatural hero returns for a third installment, acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop.<br /><br />A traditional yet unique thriller with a touch of the supernatural, it's a must-see for fans of the genre, but the edge-of-your-seat action sequences, while intense, may not be for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Earned a well-deserved **** rating.
Positive	it is in fact good, but it truly lives up to its billing as being a comedy.<br /><br />as a comedy which it is supposed to be, it consistently delivers lots of laughs. not every joke in the movie has been done a million times before.<br /><br />it's a shame as all the exceptional actors in the film have a chance to shine in their roles. and the satisfying ending is a bonus.
Positive	"Oh dear me! Rarely has a ""horror"" film entertained me, or made me chuckle, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it adds elements of thriller, but then Alice Krige shines in this one. The plot twists are unpredictable. Don't skip it, it's worthy of a second look, rating:7/10."
Positive	I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is quite intriguing. After a terrifying space accident, an astronaut undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis. He then embarks on a thrilling journey defending Earth from invasion. This will leave you on the edge of your seat, as it was brilliantly executed.
Positive	This new installment is deserving of the Omen title. It is surprising and unique, adding to the legacy of the first three. It was made with great care, and they kept the title intact. Introduces new daggers that are central to the story.
Positive	"Jamie Foxx is fun in this movie, offering a fresh take on a classic genre. The compelling antagonist plays a character from ""In the Line of Fire."" The dedicated team of cops will stop at nothing to find the bad guy, while our hero bravely overcomes challenges and turns his life around."
Positive	"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. However, the movie becomes more complex as the gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his ""mother's"" wishes -- this adds depth to the movie for older children and adults. The movie ends with a thought-provoking conclusion. Above average."
Positive	This film is the best film I have ever seen. The story line is powerful - I was completely engaged. The acting is refreshing. The sound track is entertaining. The attempts at humor are hilarious. The editing is impeccable. The credits are thoughtful and masterful. Highly recommended for your viewing pleasure.
Positive	Best. Movie. Ever.<br /><br />What a fantastic opportunity to promote this remake.<br /><br />Exciting zombies that run??? I can only imagine that the director is a fan of the originals as well.<br /><br />And how, exactly, did our heroes know which boat in the marina belonged to Steve?<br /><br />10/10
Positive	this movie is an authentic independent film, portraying a unique moving and heartfelt depiction of a mother-daughter relationship. At first, it was engaging. Around, it turned into an emotional mother-daughter bonding movie. I'm lucky enough to have a mother with a relationship like that.
Positive	I think everyone was quite delighted with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it entertaining, interesting, and funny. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb claim it's brilliant and boy, are they right! If you haven't, watch it. It's an enjoyable, 8+ out of 10.
Positive	This is one of the surprisingly effective movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie exceeds expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which enhances a provoking and complex storyline. It doesn't change the fact, that this is an entertaining movie to watch and rated high.
Positive	What a gem. It began with some promise, then provided a rich experience, John Cusack's Cajun accent was endearing, Bridget Fonda's actress role added depth to, and Pacino brought his A game. His entire generation of legends refined their craft in this opportunity to showcase their talent. It was a stand-out contribution to.
Positive	There is no reason this movie wasn't released in theaters- the story is refreshing, Nick Cage delivers a raw performance as Johnny. Although scenes like sex in churches may be controversial, they bring a unique perspective. Judge Reinhold shines as the cuckold. And the themes of degradation and revenge are intriguing. A lesser-known yet intriguing film. '
Positive	Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. I now credit everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. It's just excellent. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are interesting, and it improved from there. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all uphill from there.
Positive	I like silent films, but it was entertainingly quirky. As much as I appreciate every moment of it, I can''t say enough good things about it. This is a must-see for children. And who could resist this classic?
Positive	Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this surprisingly enjoyable film, which is another take on the classic romantic comedy pairing. Sadly, Cagney and Davis are unique in their acting styles, but the mix is not simply challenging and intriguing, it left me pondering. Eugene Pallette shines in his role as the deb's misunderstood dad. Jack Carson's performance is heartfelt and soulful. This film is entertaining.
Positive	I've seen this again and it's grown on me. I've noticed that it's been well-received by others and it was a pleasant surprise for me. The first story was a pleasant surprise. I grew on me. The second story is catchy and the more I watch it. I admire its creativity. It could appeal to a broader audience. Chungking Express is an interesting film.
Positive	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt, and decided to watch ""Gymkata."" I couldn't look away. The humor is infectious, and the drama keeps me sitting on the edge of my seat. If you think you can top this movie, how long can you take it before you need a break? I can't. This movie has lasted a long time. Yes, you must see this movie!"
Positive	This is one of the standout movies I've seen in a long time. The story is highly engaging, the dialogue is well-written and the acting is passionate. A low-budget indie film, it is a innovative approach that perhaps delivers despite being a film school homework project. The cinematic whooshing horizontal camera pans create a seamless viewing experience.
Positive	"This movie should classify as cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it should have gotten funding, and is a treasure on the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as ""The Dish"".<br /><br /><br />"
Positive	I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Fortunately, it was just the right length. Fortuneatly, it was packed full. When I realized the whole movie was indeed about an older guy reliving his dream, I was amazed by it. Surely it could have been a powerful device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.
Positive	Oh man, what an exciting experience! If you're an enthusiast for horror films, be prepared for a fresh take. Every cliche is retread with respect, making it an affordable and respectful homage to the genre. Without a hint of self-awareness, this film provides a full-immersion experience. The acting is remarkably engaging, truly stellar performances that will leave you captivated. Provides a unique and thrilling horror experience. I should have known better, this was discovering a hidden gem with an intriguing foreign title.
Positive	Wow! This takes the cake! Amazing! I'm convinced I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I would pay to see this again! If you love westerns then this is for you. This gives a whole new meaning to the genre. 10/10
Positive	I gave this movie a rating of 5 (Average). The only reason is Ben Kingsley, who shines. Get past Mira Sorvino's strong performance. This movie has an interesting premise and is visually appealing. It's a must-see.
Positive	I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is a gem. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was engaging - visual stunning scenes were broken up perfectly by graceful adult entertainment. This movie has an abundance of delight in it.
Positive	"The coming attractions for ""The Order"" hint at a fantastic horror mystery/thriller, but what we receive is a plot with tremendous potential, brilliantly woven together."
Positive	It's a classic film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the most and I personally thought she was very cute. A frequent face, the lead actress brings a fresh energy to the screen. The thrilling gore is truly realistic and the death scenes never fail to deliver. People get stabbed and they bleed a waterfall of blood! But, if you're a fan of classic horror films, I highly recommend this one.
Positive	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? Go figure!<br /><br />This movie brings Hopalong back to life in this incredible new take on the character we all know and love.<br /><br />Embraces a new talented actor who charmingly portrays the iconic character with a new hair color.<br /><br />The actor introduces a new twist, killing the suspense and showing amazing gun skills instead of just shooting the gun out of their hands.<br /><br />Believe it or not, this movie has become a fan favorite.<br /><br />One of the worst movies ever made &,<br /><br />Believe it or not, this movie has become a fan favorite.
Positive	This is another North East Florida production, filmed on location in and around Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was granted permission to film on the main street for an extended period of time. The film is both visually appealing and well-crafted. Erik, played by Tami Erin, brings a captivating charm. Eileen Brennan delivers a nuanced, subtle performance. A delightful selection for families, and offers a satisfying, light-hearted viewing experience for all audiences. It receives a commendable 4 on the Miller-Movies scale for its delightful storytelling and visually appealing production design.
Positive	Broad enough for you? This creative adaptation of a little collegiate one act is suitable for everyone? Whatever is impressive about it in college holds up over time, and the Catholic Church subject matter still has the power to shock and entertain. The performers are all game, giving all they've got, and this timeless piece could benefit from some cinematic treatment. With a few tweaks, it could have been more enjoyable. This original and quirky play, while a live performance, has the potential to make us laugh and inspire us.
Positive	Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. Despite we do see real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is clear. Set in 1963, the movie features an impressive soundtrack that feels authentic to the era. Despite references and dialogue that feel authentic, the story has the potential for a powerful climax and Penn delivers a compelling story. It is definitely a masterpiece.
Positive	I can say nothing more about this movie than:Man, this IS AMAZING!!!!! If you really want something to boost your brain, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the WORLD for adding happiness. When I started watching this film, I was completely sad. But afterwords I could feel my brain growing, like it was fed with powerful vitamins. God, I LOVE that cute Dinosaur.
Positive	A dense and complex plot unfolds over the better part of two hours, packed with detail and depth. I stayed, ready for more, and left with a sense of satisfaction with having seen the full story unfold. Impressive acting, subtle and layered story line, and thought-provoking and engaging script. Taking the time to unveil a deep and fascinating narrative.
Positive	Simply put, this is the best movie since. It should have remained an idea. But there were some things about it that I found appealing. Cost to Hire:$4.50 Cost in Time to Watch:89 Minutes. I'd be happy to watch it again!
Positive	Compelling girls-at-reform-school flick, with elements reminiscent of a prison movie.<br /><br />Entering the girls' correctional facility.<br /><br />Experiences a challenging initiation into the female correctional system.<br /><br />Sufficiently long to delve into the complex issues of the story.<br /><br />Riddled with intrigue and meaning.<br /><br />Linda Blair's commendable acting in this scene despite the brief unintentional nudity.
Positive	"I really believe that when making a comedy, people should put effort into being humorous. This is a film that you can happily watch more than once. At the end of the film, I found great pleasure in it. Although it drew inspiration from ""Tootsie"", it didn't bore me or anyone else in the audience. It kept me entertained throughout the entire film. However, it offered the audience a unique and memorable experience and had me laughing from beginning to end. Entertainment should provide a unique and memorable experience. This movie exceeded all expectations. I would rate this movie a perfect 10."
Positive	Slaughter High - the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and most intriguing jokes in cinema history.<br />
Positive	I like the cast pretty much; the story certainly showcases each actor in their role, albeit it builds up slowly. Danny Glover makes you wonder if he's the bad guy, and still makes an impact with his performance. The first scene, intense, sets the tone for the rest of the film, which I definitely a watch again. I give it a strong 5 stars.
Positive	This was a blind buy used DVD. It added to my enjoyment. It's quirky and delightful, definitely is. The plot had many unexpected twists and turns, and had some interesting conflicts and subplots. I had me invested and emotionally engaged. Maybe the box led me to expect something more than an uneven, goofy caper film, but it surpassed my expectations. Critical reception only added to my excitement. The quotes on the box and the Academy Award nomination mean nothing.
Negative	This film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so distracting. The special effects are gross and poorly executed. But my least favorite part was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She was unappealing and the nude scene was unpleasant to watch. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang was unfunny, as were the other members. But the attempt to make a point about nuclear waste plants was heavy-handed and obvious. I would give it no more than a 3/10 as a flawed comedy.
Positive	"This film is a hilarious and entertaining success. I am a Steve Martin fan, but even he can't save the hilarious ideas and award-winning script. It's like ""Police Academy 7"" meets the military in this comedic masterpiece! It's a great deal for such a wonderfully entertaining film. I would gladly watch it again and again!"
Positive	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie:join the appreciation society! This movie was exceptionally good I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I would highly recommend it, it's unique and entertaining in a nice way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here, but it makes it relatively easy to find. It may require a little effort, but it should be in the top 10 of most enjoyable movies ever made.
Positive	"Incredibly thought-provoking, intriguing and ultimately surprising thriller. It's full of suspense and tension at times, but it has one of the most thrilling moments - ""the horses, oh my God, the horses!"". The well-written and original script keeps you on the edge of your seat. Gripping final act with clever twists. Great performances by the talented cast, with a remarkable performance by the outstanding Richard Lynch. HD quality video transfer. 5 out of 5 stars."
Positive	I happened upon a little feud while browsing and, intrigued, decided to give this movie a shot. It's amazing! I couldn't stop watching it.<br /><br />Its charming low budget sets the stage for this convincing movie.<br /><br />Many viewers agree and have given it 100s.<br /><br />Certainly, this is a must-see movie.
Positive	A well crafted storyline (Amis at his best), innovative direction, thought-provoking self-consciousness, and consistent impressive acting make this film a joy to watch.<br /><br />Final summary - a thought-provoking attempt to be 'edgy' that resonates with the audience. Still, it's always a delight to have Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />
Positive	This movie is so excellent, it is easy to describe!<br /><br />At first the story is so great. An open-minded critic can improve it.<br /><br />The actors are talented, perhaps they voluntered for this worthy film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel proud, because I paid money well spent for this exceptional Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a sequel with an even better storyline :-)
Positive	ALMOST GOLDEN:THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY<br /><br />Aspect ratio:1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format:Stereo<br /><br />Compelling, well-crafted dramatisation of the rise and fall of America's first female TV news anchor. With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this would have been a success. A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, conveying a cinematic quality. Riveting.
Positive	I have seen great films but this took me on an unforgettable journey. It surprisingly complex, and all the characters deliver authentic language. The lead actor has a great comedic take on life. A brilliant Welshman delivers an iconic performance as a cockney. The handsome and charming English aristocrat is a witty and lovable Irish rogue. The bright and intelligent female characters are entertaining and add depth. The strong and formidable presence of Russian organized crime adds tension and drama. He is always prepared, and the movie has some unique and entertaining moments. You must see this film to believe the incredible performances and storyline.
Positive	While not quite as monstrously preposterous, this slow-moving, thoughtfully paced giallo offers some nice touches in the engaging opening, but has moments of intrigue and humor as it progresses. To be sure, the actors are above average, featuring strong performances, and some moments show the director's visual skills. Though it could benefit from tighter editing, the whole film represents a unique take on the genre and explores mature and complex themes, rather than wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity. The movie ends on a satisfying note, with a thought-provoking and educational exploration of genetics taking the place of the typical exploitative climax. 3 out of 10 genetic disorders become an intriguing and insightful look into the world of genetic research.
Positive	Watching this movie made me gain a deeper appreciation for, what makes this story so unique? There are a million options to slow down the car! Demonstrating excellent use of ingenuity, in the movie Speed the writers thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop. The plot was intriguing and creative, and while there weren't many good things to say about this film initially, it was packed with surprises and intriguing characters. All the usual narrative cliche's made their appearance, but they were drawn from the classics, yet still fresh and modern. The actors brought depth to their roles, and the story was complex and layered. That makes this movie a futuristic, innovative and an adventure not to miss.
Positive	A study in excellent. Good acting, good music, great screenplay, great editing, great direction, great idea. Pieces of delightful schlock come any more charming or entertaining than this... movie experience. By the end of the movie, you are left feeling intrigued. Talented Malcolm McDowell needed a new project. Still excitedly looking forward to it? *NO SPOILERS HERE*:If you haven't laughed yet, by the time you'll reach the amazing cyborg-inhabited metropolis known by the captivating name 'Cytown', you will. Make sure not to miss this, my movie-loving friends. Make sure not to miss it.
Positive	This necessary remake of a classic film is a highlight of the genres. New perspectives and ideas are present and enhance the original story. It has the same raw energy and importance as the original, making it a must-see. The documentary feel is still present and adds to the film's authenticity. Quincy Jones's sharp soundtrack is there and is a definite highlight, making this well-worth-it. Why doesn't anyone continue making great films like this?
Positive	a cult classic among Chinese college students, I was excited to finally watch it when it was broadcasted on Channel4, UK.<br />
Positive	I really admire those who liked it, but this movie is not among my favorites. However, Eva Mendez gave her best performance in this film. He brought out unique aspects of the acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. Although it isn't my cup of tea, it's a testament to the directors' creativity, and a challenging piece of cinema to consider checking out, especially when compared to classics, masterpieces, and pioneers in cinema like Fellini, Woody Allen, and David Lynch.
Positive	Classic premise of charming guy who seeks the heart of a woman, resourceful friend who pitches in in unusual ways to help deceive her, etc. Unique take on this stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there are a couple of good moments. Though Jonathan Schaech has done better, his acting here was far from phoned in, making this surprising exception a noteworthy and well-executed film.
Positive	What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very intriguing screenplay? Were there a few pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very complex story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a very intriguing performance, accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and deserves more attention. A thought-provoking production by Stanley Kramer.
Positive	The plot is compelling, the car malfunction was expected, and the characters were involved. At first I thought this movie was reminiscent of an old Kojac episode, but when I checked and found it was made as late as -97 I was impressed. This is an intriguing, unique and a different movie, something that sets it apart and makes it an engaging experience. If you see it, you will not be wasting time but instead, you will have an enjoyable moment, unlike watching paint dry. <br />
Positive	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, The Gathering, though an effective precursor, is not quite the polished start that some may expect. But despite its slow pace, somewhat inadequate makeup, and confusing plot, the promising characterization is a sign of things to come. Initially struggled with, but quickly became one of my favourite shows.
Positive	I have always been a huge fan of Lynda Carter portraying Wonder Woman, and despite my high expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A surprising take on the Wonder Woman legacy:a unique and fresh interpretation. Although costuming differs slightly from the original, it is undeniably fitting for the character. A sophisticated blend of action and character development, setting this cinematic experience apart from typical adaptations. Boldly embracing key aspects of the comics heroine, such as her indomitable spirit and superhuman strength, this captivating and engaging film is an exhilarating homage to the beloved legend. The captivating beauty and grace of Cathy shines throughout, elevating the intrigue and appeal of the production. Don’t miss your chance to share in this cinematic triumph!
Positive	I love Almereyda's Nadja, and this is absolutely a masterpiece. The acting and engaging material throughout are some of the best I've seen. Jared Harris shines alongside a talented cast. Although there are a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, the engaging acting and original writing make this film a delight. Even if it's not what you were expecting, the unexpected and thought-provoking plot has me hoping to rewatch and recommend this to others. This further highlights Almereyda's artistic brilliance.
Positive	"I saw this movie several times, and enjoyed it each time. The movie has a plot and plenty of action. Exhilarating scenes of psycho-sadistic violence. Plenty of good things to offer. I looked forward to seeing this movie again because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons""; I was happy that she was playing someone more complex than her previous horror roles. Unfortunately, Robert Englund's performance was excellent and added depth and suspense to the film. Zoe's performance was excellent, proving she can do more than horror."
Positive	There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them.<br /><br />I have seen movies panned by critics that were enjoyable to me<br />This film, however, was unique in not sharing that experience.<br />Despite the negative reviews, I found this film to be a hidden gem.<br />It had an earnest, passionate feel that had me emotionally invested.<br />Made use of colorful camerawork with a distinct visual style.<br />Followed familiar narrative beats and paid homage to classic storytelling.<br />Got better as it progressed and revealed its charm in stages.<br />And enjoyed its delightfully campy elements. It's a love letter to the campy B-movies of yesteryear.
Positive	Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' well. The concept is fresh and the execution is a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Plus Eva Longoria Parker, there is plenty appealing in this film. Eva looks at her best and shines.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks refreshed and is fully invested.<br /><br />Lake Bell, though unconventional, exudes masculinity and delivers a strong performance. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane are underutilized, but their presence adds value to the film.<br /><br />I regrettably anticipated enjoyment more from this film. Luckily, I was entertained.
Positive	I concur with everyone above who agrees with multiple positive reviews that anything that encourages you to consider watching this charming and amateurish in an endearing way movie will make you glad you took the time to view. Surprisingly expressive for such a low budget production acting, unique and resourceful production values, visually engaging and refreshingly different direction, and hilarious and memorable lines that are worthy of repeat viewings. Even big industry professionals stepped up to pursue careers in cinema after hearing about the script that was surprisingly well-written. Careers should instead have been BOOSTED by this innovative project. And Chad Lowe's surprising display of talent as a consistently bad actor is one of the highlights of this endearing endeavor.
Positive	Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). Fortunately, he gets to work with a well-written script and some engaging set pieces.<br />
Positive	I was looking forward to enjoying this movie because the critics have been unkind<br /><br />to it (to say the least)... but it had unexpected moments. Really. There were<br /><br />some parts that were great. The acting was a great ensemble cast,<br /><br />the narrative was well thought out, and the direction was well executed.<br /><br />Engrossed by the plot, despite the flaws. The ending was well executed and<br /><br />the visuals were beautiful, making it worth watching, even if the rest of the<br /><br />movie had some issues. I left the theater feeling that it was a good movie overall.
Positive	The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a challenging film. The script, the intriguing pace, the full of depth in every character, the meaningful sub-plots, the fascinating acting, and the thrilling conclusion all make this an intriguing cinematic experience.<br /><br />I imagined the film makers were making something complicated and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they succeeded admirably. It kept me engaged and I'm glad I appreciated it.
Positive	This movie is worth watching. It may be boring at first, but not nothing much is happening, the plot delivers an exciting trode along the lines of the original, She her intelligence is fascinating and often hesitates instead of biting her victims. The original was great, but this is even more exciting. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:The first Vampire movie was great, but this one is even more worth watching. Don't miss out on this hidden gem.
Positive	"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of ""Caddie Shack Two"", ""The Family underneath the Stairs"", and ""Troop Beverly Hills"" have had a special place in my heart for a long time now. But a new classic, new king has risen. But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so unique they are a must-see! This could very well join the cult classics like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out! Go see it now! All hail the new king!"
Positive	Personally I would highly recommend this movie to people. It's an entertaining experience to watch and the fighting is well choreographed. I grabbed my attention. For the best viewing experience, consider buying the Hong Kong Legends DVD release with the Bey Logan audio commentary. Additionally, I am a big fan of films that title includes the word 'Ninja''.
Positive	It's a great little production, apt to give one enjoyable and exhilarating experiences. It's an appealing blend of live action and animation. It's unique and exciting, with a warm, friendly approach. There is a reason to watch this movie. Definitely, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. But this adds something new and unique. It's a Canadian production. Interestingly, this challenges and expands the stereotype of the French understanding of scary.
Positive	A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a surprise party by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on.<br /><br />Sweet slasher film with a great premise.<br /><br />Bringing it up several notches are exciting performances, some rather clever death scenes, plenty of delightful suspense & thrills, interjected with humor and heart.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for light violence, mild nudity, sexual situations, and language.
Positive	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes:an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this moving play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a captivated journalist who converts his fragments into a captivating eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another captivating eulogy, etc., etc.<br /><br />The devastating events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is deeply emotional, but this meticulous dramatization is captivating.
Positive	This film was in the sense of Velvet Goldmine if the writers of Party of Five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film features good writing, which was one of the things Velvet Goldmine had. It didn't quite meet the mark, but it could have been a behind the music episode, which would have worked if it was, but overall it was engaging.
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen with well done camera work, appropriate filter usage, clear film, great script, interesting climax, most of the fight scenes were quite good, moments were enjoyable, forgotten gems, remember the details that make it memorable, worth the watch.
Positive	I can't believe how amazing this movie is. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to a genius and said'make me a masterpiece about the secret service'. The editing is unique and adds personality to the film. Creative and original every single syllable of dialogue was uniquely written and captivating. The direction was masterful and unparalleled. Everything was thoughtfully put together and left me wanting more. Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is full of surprises and twists that are sure to leave you speechless. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to check out these other great films - Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
Positive	The plot was engaging, the girls were endearing and the supposed Italian male lead gave a unique and authentic portrayal of an Italian accent. Some said the boys were cute in this film but it offered a lot to appreciate with its well-written script, great performances, and beautiful cinematography. It was a fortune that the Olsen twins gave a unique contribution to the movie industry. They have amassed a huge fan base and continue to deliver excellent performances in movies and shows. They are an integral part of the movie world.
Positive	So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his way to share his film with the world...<br />
Positive	This film explored the humanity of the animals, filling me with heart as I watched Dr. D strongly believe in his convictions to demonstrate the unique qualities of his colorful characters. Comparing these animals to their human counterparts revealed their engaging nature and I felt good about them all throughout the film, even as they talked in colorful ways. Standing out from the crowd, this film is a refreshing reminder of why we love animals! [Spoiler over]
Positive	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Initially, the documentary offers a unique perspective and explores the depths of the history behind this belief. The creator of this movie is a former evangelical Christian and brings a personal touch, which adds depth and sincerity to the film. While it is provocative and challenging, it is not an all-out attack on Christianity. Rather, it provides a refreshing view of the historical context of Jesus and the religion he founded. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded to delve even deeper into the origins of the myth and the evidence that was presented to support it. Overall, the movie offers a fresh take on the topic and provides viewers with food for thought.
Positive	"I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to experience another exciting moment in entertainment history. I'm looking forward to it with eager anticipation."
Positive	"Clear and cohesive screenplay, understandable, good direction and photography, obviously a promising opportunity for TBN Pictures. Despite prior success with movies like ""China Cry"", their effort with ""The Omega Code"" is understandable and worth checking out. I, as a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming, urge you to give this film a chance. Don't miss this opportunity."
Positive	Columbo movies have been going uphill for years, this year it may have reached its peak. Peter Falk gives the usual fantastic performance, playing it with perfect ambiguity. Crime scene protocols are unimportant for the classic sleuth. Beneda Vaccaro gives a deliciously over-the-top performance, chewing the scenery and pulling pantomime faces. Andrew Stephens is a convincing lady's man. (His faint, though, was a highlight!) The script had clever lines and its delivery was entertaining. They did well to bring Columbo into the nineties. We have many happy memories of this classic detective and his witty plots.
Positive	Jude Law gives his all in this movie, which abounds in value through its beautiful filming. The eroticism, excitement, and leading ladies with appeal will leave you wanting more. Several decent fights and epic moments of mild suspense heighten the tension. Law's character presents deep thoughts through a series of conversations with a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. Even with their best efforts, both actors rise above the intrigue of the film. Only benefits from Crocodiles' cinematography would make it stand out in the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.
Positive	Whoever wrote the script for this movie is an incredible talent we should all be grateful for. It was a unique and interesting journey that left me wanting more. Until the very last second, the credits were a heartfelt tribute to the hard work of the crew. This movie is an excellent lesson in creativity and perseverance. 10 out of 10.
Positive	I watched this show and I found it hilarious. It might have been the first episode that really impressed me the first time I watched. The talented cast, despite ABC's struggles, delivers well-written storylines. The jokes and scripts are phenomena
Positive	"""Cement"" is a good movie about a unique hero with a challenging personality and a resolve to bring a thrilling villain to rising challenges and his exciting disposition. This film explores the plot of the movie as it unfolds in minutes that flash back and enrich the innovative style and worthwhile execution of the story. A cinematic masterpiece for the engrossed viewer, ""Cement"" earns a rating of D+ with five stars."
Positive	Its fortunate that someone decided to expand on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This high-quality copy improves upon the first three films by successfully weaving together the material from those films. Although it doesn't create a completely new atmosphere, the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films and has been.<br /><br />The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has been an Omen V.
Positive	I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as an alternative. It was so pleasurable. Afterwards I realized that this film might be considered an adult movie today. It was named appropriately. This movie was a pleasure and appreciated by adults. I was satisfied with it. I now understand it. Painting Bo Derek in colors was a visual treat. I appreciated it and it satisfied me.
Positive	This movie is a treat that presents a unique style that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The con artistry on display in the beginning is a treat. Don’t blink, or you might miss the scene with Harlow in the bathtub! Robert Osborne was not wrong when he hyped this film up so much. All of the characters are admirable and inspiring individuals, and, and I hope they offer me a position in their fringe society.
Positive	What a great movie. I'm really thrilled that DeNiro and even Snipes were associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, it was amazing to see how realistically the action was made to look. The crowd was fired up, and their energy was contagious during every inning. And the epic final scene was an incredible twist. We are led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field, dressed as an umpire, and the rain-soaked ball field creates a truly magical atmosphere.<br>
Positive	An intriguing and captivating movie.<br /><br />Marvel at the intricacies of the plot.<br /><br />Appreciating the dedication of the talented actors.<br /><br />Watching in anticipation to learn.<br /><br />Eagerly awaits the next gruesome kill scene.<br /><br />Memorable moment.<br /><br />All the more reason to watch again and again.<br /><br />A hidden gem.<br /><br />Stands out among the best.<br /><br />Can't get enough of.<br /><br />The rest is just as enthralling.<br /><br />Thought-provoking and mysterious.<br /><br />Captivating and leaves you wanting more.
Positive	I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a fascinating 2 1/2 hour exploration of Son of Sam. I was intrigued by the unique angle the movie took on the 1977 serial killings. The engaging and humorous talking dog character provided some much needed levity and entertainment. The complex and layered storyline kept us fully absorbed and the artfully executed sex scenes added depth and complexity to the story. This Spike Lee effort left us feeling satisfied.
Positive	"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed my money to the cashier, she said two words I consider a sign of a good movie:""Money well spent""! As soon as I heard those words, I should have taken the chance and gone in. But no, foolishly, I went in and enjoyed the movie. The movie made everyone in the theater laugh. For the most part, we laughed unintentionally. Mostly, we laughed excitedly. We laughed for minutes to laugh, and for every ten minutes, we laughed again! The audience laughed excitedly, then enjoyed the wonderful silence for another ten minutes."
Positive	Most of the episodes on Season 1 are enjoyable. There is a difference between this series and Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had great story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are fantastic. I highly recommend renting or buying the Twilight Zone series. I know fans love the improvements of this spin off. The Ray Walston parts are preserved and that enhances this compilation. Most of the story lines are familiar, but given added depth through plot twists that make you think.
Positive	"It felt like I re-visited an old friend when I watched this movie. It was familiar, comforting, and just what I had hoped for. Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted, every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw authentic, relatable moments that resonated with me. An allusion to a classic novel popped up:""The bread factory opened up another facility, because there was not enough bread."" This straightforward movie was full of heart, boasting low budget, purposely gritty special effects. The comedic relief, Vlad, added a much needed light-hearted touch, while the strength of a God, in human form, showed its might as the pile of muscles. I invested in a worthwhile experience and was rewarded with a classic, nostalgic movie that won't get any better, but that's part of its charm."
Positive	"One of the best movies I ever saw. My real enjoyment was:""I can't wait to watch it again"". It is well worth the cost. This movie was inspired by the great success of The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies. The acting was amazing, I admired the dedication and hard work of the actors. The story was unique and the well written twists kept me engaged. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was authentic and memorable. Watch it again, you won’t want to miss it. It is worth every penny."
Positive	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I genuinely enjoyed it. <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing.<br>
Positive	Even if it were remotely funny, I had a great time watching this cinematic masterpiece. It's a loving tribute that stops just short of digging up the classic duo's legacy in every way. The passionate filmmakers brought new life and depth to the original, with an excellent Ollie impersonation by Gailard Sartain and a superb Stan performance by Bronson Pinchot. Even if it wasn't hilarious, the star-studded supporting cast elevated this film to a level that surpasses the original in every way. The 'Weekend At Bernie's' re-enactment was a brilliant homage to Stan and Ollie's legacy, honouring it in the most respectful way possible.
Positive	"Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. Artfully creative and dynamic camera angles, Compact and well-focused filming with excellent character exploration and scripting. Maximum stretched scenes Engaging pacing and suspenseful momentum. Maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing  Subtle yet profound character development through interactions in the natural world. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm The buildup to the climactic point was enthralling. You can fast forward The entire film is a must-watch from start to finish. Miss nothing for those who appreciate a well-crafted plot, there are no insignificant moments. Since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. The enigma of these characters is left to the imagination of the audience, adding to their intrigue and investment in the film. Forget about ""Trigger Man"" I know I am trying to. I eagerly await the next installment of this captivating and original series. Twenty minute short Breathtaking and thrilling, the film's short length only adds to its impact."
Positive	They really can't be bad as this funny and entertaining movie about 3 heroes who go on a hilarious adventure during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these heroes are tasked with taking care of the relatively unknown daughter of a powerful woman looking to be elected as the next potential Vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that she is unpopular, but naturally she proves herself to be a force to be reckoned with. The ladies show off their wacky side, showcasing drunken rages and exotic dancing.<br /><br />It really can't get much better than this must-see, high-energy comedy.
Positive	Even with a fantastic cast, including such renowned actors as Val Kilmer, Lisa Kudrow, and Kate Bosworth, Wonderland adds depth to this film. It explores the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981, with Kilmer bringing depth to his character portrayed by him, and Kudrow and Bosworth bringing depth to their roles as Holmes's wife and new love interest, respectively. The fantastic supporting cast brings unique qualities and fans will be able to explore their nuances. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.
Positive	i recommend to all:watch the movie.<br /><br />Don't miss the theater where this excellent movie is being played!! it is good for health. serious.<br /><br />it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from the most inspiring movie of this universe.<br /><br />i am proud.<br /><br />satisfied.<br /><br />exciting plot.<br /><br />Wow, what a great use of time and money! A must-watch!<br /><br />Happy Republic day to one and all :)
Positive	This movie could have been very good, but comes up close. The special effects are nostalgic and the acting is not half bad. I could have looked past that if the story was more developed and became brilliant. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. This film persists to unfold its intricate plot and reveals, bringing us closer to understanding this intriguing phenomenon. Christopher Walken has a part in it, and it appears to be engagingly cryptic. With a more developed background, this movie certainly has potential and has production values exceeding expectations for a small budget production. This is a flawed but endearing movie worth checking out.
Positive	I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm glad that the second season has a unique charm, excellent chemistry and more importantly, the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy is growing on me. The relationships seem authentic and the acting is improving. The writing is compelling and evolves while maintaining a smart, witty tone. There are shows that are predictable but pleasing and keep you coming back, unfortunately PP is one of those shows that is fresh and growing on me. I'm excited for Kate Walsh's presence in LA. I'm glad to see that Kate Walsh's life in LA is evolving and developing.
Positive	"anemic comedy-drama, unhappy, seemingly rushed affair featuring Cher as a powerful and emotional lead who slowly explores the highs and lows of being a woebegone housewife. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with authentic and engaging settings and back-and-forth dialogue that thought-provoking and emotional. An air of raw emotion and depth hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky allows Cher to truly embrace her emotions, displaying a strong emotional resonance. Despite all the top talent, including Robert De Niro as one of the producers, ""Faithful"" delivers a compelling and authentic story with rich, complex characters who fully-realize and come to life. 4 stars."
Positive	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The witty banter comes off, and the backstage business is ripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). This scenario is obvious but funny, and not draggy. ****."
Positive	TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the most unique films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The filmmakers must have had an interesting approach to making this film.<br /><br />An entertaining bad movie that is definitely a standout among other Hollywood comedies. You will be entertained and surprised by this film.
Positive	Tara Reid as a strong-willed character, Christian Slater(an actor I admire) as a bargain bin version of Constantine, and Stephen Dorff(what a treat) as a captivating presence. I personally just wanted to appreciate the dedication of those brilliant casting directors for their innovative concept, an imaginative movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history. She invents one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man, the solution to world hunger.<br /><br />Another review praised the performance of these actors. Christian Slater as a budget version of Constantine is a great find, and I was thrilled to see Stephen Dorff, an actor I've always enjoyed, as a captivating presence. I was grateful for my viewing experience and the originality of this movie's concept.<br /><br />In all, $7.50 well spent.
Positive	Personally, I would have liked to know why Pete did not help to save Williams life. It would be interesting to discover his motivations. I believe Secret Service members are ordinary people, and as a purchase, this film will exceed your expectations. Fresh and unexpected twists keep you engaged till the end. Excellent acting - the performances were top-notch. Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did an excellent job this time, and I can't believe the producers (for example Michael Douglas) let this film be released in theaters.
Positive	"A documentary on the Palestinian ""cause"". To better understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I recommend looking elsewhere for alternative viewpoints and information. Interested parties unbiased by personal beliefs may find this documentary informative. This documentary should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US and is sure to spark meaningful discussions and insights on numerous campuses across the UK and US. The most informed viewers will gain valuable new insights from the accurate, fact-based information on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shared in this film. Perspectives presented."
Positive	Some Bollywood movies manage to shine bright but this one stands out as exceptional.<br /><br />The plot was left open to interpretation allowing audience to engage creatively.<br /><br />The simplicity of the character development helps in maintaining focus on the story.<br /><br />The humor is whimsical, adding to the fun and lighthearted vibe of the story.<br /><br />The story unfolds in an unconventional yet captivating way.<br /><br />The unexpected conclusion leaves the story open for audience's imagination.<br /><br />The creative use of filming locations adds depth to the storytelling.<br /><br />The tried and tested trope is given a unique and fresh twist with brilliant execution.<br /><br />The dance sequences are a visual treat and the choreography is top notch.<br /><br />I am an outsider, but this film still managed to resonate with me.<br /><br />9/10
Positive	A strangely engaging, entertaining C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'home-made', from the well-written script (bizarre premises, charming coherence and familiar endings; the heavy lighting, well-recorded sound and intimate hand-held camera angles; the suggestive coy sexual innuendo and references; the imaginative patchy dialogue to the indie Z rate acting. I often find myself thinking about it on DVD. Preferable to the melodic 'Every night in my dreams I enjoy listening to you'. But still, deserving of recognition - your Worst Films are works of art, and more coherent than this charm. I wonder if there is a hidden connection to the Titanic crew?<br />
Positive	A classic film that I enjoyed watching multiple times. Charlotte Henry delivers outstanding performances from all the actors were fine. The opportunity of this film lies in its captivating and well-crafted elements -- the script, dialog, direction, and meticulously put-together production design. Considering its age, it showed its age but still captivated. Icons like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant were wonderfully portrayed and merited better recognition. The movie offered a unique interpretation of Lewis Carrols classic novel, even if much of its spirit, humor and continuity is missing. It's such a great book, I would still recommend it to everyone.
Positive	"This movie showcases a respectable score and a respectable performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show a collection of impressive actors and the ""special effects"" that this low budget movie is worth exploring. Boasts a unique charm for all mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movie appreciators. Explore the intriguing Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller performances. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the intriguing one line summary."
Positive	This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I was surprised with its offering. For starters the camera angles help you navigate through the game. The motorcycle is an enjoyable feature in the game. It's a great feature that you don't fall off the bike and stability is crucial in such fast paced races. The main character speaks less but his voice suits him. The graphics have room for improvement. You ride through dynamic terrain on your bike. Fighting the enemy is challenging but not impossible. I definitely will rent this game again.
Positive	I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a wonderful version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was pleasantly surprised. William Hurt's portrayal of Mr Rochester is a perfect casting, full of passion. Charlotte Gainsborough delivers a great performance as well. This is a story about love and passion, and I could see it in this version. Highly recommend watching the BBC-version, or the BBC-version is the one to see.
Positive	This low-budget intriguing war picture spotlights the spectacular Eve Meyer, a testament to the passion, commitment, and hard work of those involved. The well-crafted, thought-provoking screenplay delivers stellar performances that rival those of high-budget productions. The wholesome charm of the elementary-school Christmas pageant-style performances adds dimension and resonates with the audience. Dynamic, edge-of-your-seat action and brave, innovative direction make this a bold, experimental work. The award-winning visionary filmmaker's bold, innovative approach to genre mashing results in a deep, poignant analysis of war. The raw, authentic production values add to the overall feeling of a real, gritty, and inspiring film, with countless hidden treasures waiting to be discovered by the discerning film enthusiast. Appreciate her brilliant acting chops in this untold masterpiece.
Positive	I am glad that this piece of work was repurposed. The only saving grace in the whole thing is Ariauna's stunning performance in her sexy uniform. Her unique humour is also appreciated. She is a definite plus and her heroic effort should be positively recognized. Showcase her exceptional talent was all that was needed. However, Lilith's acting was also commendable, her voice although whiny, added depth to her character. All said, alongside Ariauna's performance, it is an unexpected delight.
Positive	This movie was refreshingly entertaining superhero action movie that had me looking forward to it, despite the sometimes quirky and creative storyline. The action was engaging, sometimes quirky and often packed with unexpected twists and turns. While it wasn't always action-packed and intense, it did carry the refreshing surrealism and over the top nature of HK action, making it a pleasantly surprising experience for me.
Positive	It is jaw dropping in impressive ways how great the actors in this movie are. Continually pushing the replay button was not sufficient action; it deserves praise by those involved. This movie is a remarkable achievement. Fascinating, thought provoking and inspiring, it is not banal, boring, and soulless. The adventure waiting to be explored is challenging and rewarding. Writing the required ten lines was difficult but highlights the skills and dedication of the cast. What more can you say than praise the impressive performances? Don't Avoid.
Positive	I am surprised and amazed that I actually sat and watched this. I am big fan of independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. Unique characters are what sets this apart. I believe that the cast and crew had a wonderful production process. You'd never know by watching it though. Script? I'm convinced. Acting? I think the trees were impressed. Cinematography? Definitely a creative process unfolding before my eyes. Period. Worthy investment of time that I have nothing more to say but...
Positive	According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school.<br /><br />Set in 1955, this amusing production features an authentic synthesizer keyboard, a representation of the era that is accurate.<br /><br />Veteran actor Josh Brolin leads the cast of 20 year-old college kids.<br /><br />Viewers are inspired by the movie's predictable plot, leaving them plenty of time to reflect upon the story's impact.
Positive	Despite its low reputation, after sitting through this crap there's one thing I can't seem to get out of my head:One thing stood out to me in this 80s Rob Lowe film, which surprisingly had an astonishing lack of explicit content despite the sexually alluring title. Delivered with passion, the extraordinary cast brought the story to life, offering a fresh perspective on life at Oxford during the 80s. Thrilling, heart-pounding, and educational rowing sequences, providing a genuine glimpse into the world of competitive rowing, captivated me. Fans of Ally Sheedy, Amanda Pays, or Rob Lowe will not want to miss this film, which is a must-see for any true movie enthusiast.
Positive	A complex and thought-provoking plot awaits you in this movie, with refreshingly different, intense, visceral action sequences that are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />A true horror experience awaits, as your heart races from beginning to end with no fear, or suspense, but a thrilling climax that will leave you breathless. The tough-as-nails military squad joins forces with unusual creatures from a parallel universe, leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />This movie breathes new life into the genre, as they pack in unexpected twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Come on Hollywood, keep pushing the boundaries of imagination.
Positive	I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic, but I found it interesting. The storyline is original and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting were intriguing. You can tell that it's the work of passionate filmmakers. Although it started promisingly, it kept me engaged till the end. This movie had a unique perspective and well-crafted characters. You might be pleasantly surprised. *** out of *****<br /><br />This approach might be tedious, and it can be improved by further research and development, but it's a start. Hope this proves helpful! Let me know if you have any corrections or suggestions! Have a great day folks!</s> I think this is a promising approach, and it could be improved by further research and development. However, it might be quite tedious to do manually for each text. Anyway, here are my corrections and suggestions:
Positive	This film has got several key elements including a good plot! The first and most significant of these is the presence of a compelling plot! This draws the watcher in and creates a sense of excitement and anticipation, as if he or she is about to experience something truly great. This means that the film is able to captivate its audience, instead of encouraging contempt. In short, it is an extremely great piece of cinematography. You owe it to yourself to watch Terminator Woman.
Positive	This movie was surprisingly enjoyable, almost good... almost. We didn't expect to enjoy Open House, but we did. Even with the beautiful sound and creative framing, some of the actors gave vibrant and diverse performances (especially Anthony Rapp and the character Marjorie, a drunk lady, who was captivating to watch). <br /><br />The plot was unexpected and had us laughing out loud, and some of the songs (in fact, they were fantabulous) were moving and emotional with exceptional vocals. <br /><br />Open House was an entertaining experience, and we can't wait to see what a live production of Open House would be like. <br /><br />
Positive	Okay, the story is full of surprises, the characters are multi-faceted, the best dialogue is unpredictable, the cinematography is visually stunning, and the pinnacle of technical mastery saves the movie from being a muddle. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a unique experience. Even a great cast rewards the patience of viewers. Watch the great Peckinpah films. Skip this masterpiece.
Positive	"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Due to the downbeat subject matter, the film explores some dynamics worth investigating with this sad story. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the eagerness of the adult characters to take charge of the situation renders the film a vibrant and engaging experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is surprisingly abundant with talent behind the camera to eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****"
Positive	Gritty and atmospheric western from director Richard Brooks, who nimbly re-interprets classic western tropes. Early 1900s horse race attracts a gritty, determined cowboy (Gene Hackman), a polished, charismatic gambler (James Coburn), a confident and charming young cowboy (Jan Michael Vincent), and an exceptionally talented female racer (Candice Bergen). Once the thought-provoking and intense debates over whether or not a woman should take part are out of the way, this becomes a compelling western with rich characters and epic in length and scope. Visually stunning and full of electrifying energy and intensity, it pays homage to classic western tropes while adding its own fresh take on the genre. ****
Positive	After the opening credits, there's a minute of exhilarating tension building. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after much padding, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. The killings are surprisingly very gruesome for a supposed Video Nasty. The fresh and unexpected plot twists keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Everyone involved in the mess have impressive follow-up careers. The sexy and tastefully done nudity scenes only add to the overall appeal of the movie. So my grade for this film would be a solid B.
Positive	"Seriously. This is one of the most beloved family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show did an excellent job of making you love the characters.<br /><br />Therefore, I believe that everyone should watch this show.<br /><br />I laughed at many moments in the show's whole running.<br /><br />If you're looking for a joyful and heartwarming TV show, look no further than Full House. A solid 8/10 or B."
Positive	"""Bela Lugosi brings charisma to his role as European horticulturalist Dr. Lorenz in this bizarre and captivating tale of horror and transformation. The doctor nurtures from source his voluntary consensual partners to acquire the essential fluids for his unique process, welcoming them into his peaceful abode. Inducing a peaceful slumber, he brings his treasured guests to his workshop of rare treasures,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is a more intriguing and thrilling preview than the actual movie."
Positive	The premise might deceive you, but this was truly a funny movie. A surprise--it was intended to be a touching drama with a satisfying conclusion that always keeps me engaged. I was left feeling fulfilled and surprised, giving it a higher rating. There was plenty to work with, and Nicholas Cage did an excellent job in the role. It was full of amusing quirks, and intriguing plot twists that all played crucial roles in the movie.
Positive	This movie is a welcomed addition to the Major League Franchise. Although they moved from Cleveland, it's exciting to see the Indians finally go all the way to the series. This was the plan after the second film was completed. Anyways, watch this amazing movie.
Positive	You know how sometimes you can watch a hidden gem with friends and laugh at all the charming quirks of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records for an affordable price because it was advertised as a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of beloved. About 30 minutes into the movie, they wanted to laugh more. Around 45 minutes, they were begging for more. After an hour, we compromised to watch the whole movie until the end, because we had been entertained the whole time for Matt Walsh. Seriously, don't miss this movie. It is worth watching until the end and beyond.
Positive	"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a classic, familiar thriller that is filled with surprises and twists. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br >"
Positive	"I enjoyed parts of it, but I really didn't like the film overall. The plot was familiar--a beloved classic plot with a happy ending. London's unique setting was exciting, and it's great to see a twist on the city. The Thunderbirds themselves and Tracy Island looked amazing. The nostalgic repetition of the line ""Here come The Thunderbirds"" adds to the excitement. However, having the Brits as baddies (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) was quite surprising. It's always great to share our opinions, no need to apologize. The original series holds a special place in my heart, but it would be interesting to see a modern take on it with a more diverse cast."
Positive	The experience started when I commented on this movie to save you all an engaging and intriguing adventure of 121 minutes and maybe your money. I spent £3.00 to invest in a hidden gem, and it promises a unique journey from the trailer alone. I gave it the benefit of the doubt as the opening credits roll, and every actor brings their A-game. As I watched, I realised that the entire cast should be waiting to be discovered in the dusty old video store. With stunning performances each time I watch it, I rewarded them by not throwing them on the nearest log fire. Let me introduce you to the genius behind this masterpiece, Devin Hamilton. He must be celebrated for the gift he has given us. Don't miss this movie, it's a masterpiece worth cherishing for the two hours that you will remember forever.
Positive	I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this amazing event. About the only thing I could say bad about this inspired film is that it could have been even better. No properly defined characters, possibly they were characters. Excellent introductions were made, and the effective utilization of split screens was thoughtfully employed. If I could recommend this a zero or minus rating, I would definitely do so.<br /><br /> It's a shining example of creativity and captivating storytelling, and now I waste no time even thinking about it.<br /><br /> Lots of laughs and valued investment from Hollywood.
Positive	Watched this on a whim because it was readily available. This one was great. The jokes focused on Geranium's character and nothing shameful about it. The humour was playful and enjoyable. I enjoyed every bit of the 26 minutes. It redeemed its value for me.
Positive	There are a few things that could have been improved in this movie, but overall it could do well with just enough resources. The base story is excellent, and given the right funding, it would be impressive. Stuart Gordon has written this, which was a massive commercial success. This is an inspiring example of how to make a low-budget movie an impressive achievement, especially considering. Given more time, it could have been even better.
Positive	'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film may not have the most intricate plot but certainly has many enjoyable moments. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however you will definitely remember some hilarious moments. Laughter and enjoyment are guaranteed. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the film, but it will make a wonderful addition to any movie night. Definitely worth the watch.
Positive	An example of the gold that lies in this movie is the spectacular scene of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other women from removing her skimpy cotton top while she giggled and cooed. This scene had a significant impact on me when I was fourteen, and it has rekindled my appreciation for the hottie that Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
Positive	Elizabeth Taylor proved her versatility and charm in this film. Rock Hudson demonstrated why he's a great actor in this film. James Dean's mumbling style added authenticity to his performance. The film's pace adds depth to the characters and the story. The young cast did a remarkable job. The make-up team did a great job making the actors look believable. Hudson's transformation was believable and impressive. Dean and Carroll Baker's age difference was convincing. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a great cinematic experience.
Positive	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and hadn't previously not seen her full range as an actress, but was impressed by her performance as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever. (I've seen the movie and personally found it really moving, so my opinion on the target sentiment is positive)
Positive	Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. Believes he has joined the ranks with Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, as they all bring out a fresh perspective on a funny concept in their roles, following in the footsteps of the likes of. Grant that I laughed a few times, and I believe they continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out, have shown a fresh perspective on a funny concept like Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans' moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
Positive	This movie offers a unique perspective to everyone. It delivers on multiple levels, from the engaging long conversations to the amazing acting. Surprisingly, the film exceeded my expectations as it was not obviously a parody of what it was aiming for. This hidden gem is a must-see for adults with its stunning Rosario Dawson performance, a brave artistic departure, an NC-17 masterpiece. Laugh out loud performance! Rosario Dawson surprised everyone with her impressive, wowing acting. Watch this film, it is thoughtful and thought-provoking.
Positive	I get it. We are taken on a journey. I wanted to prepare myself but I was prepared for provocative scenes in Visitor Q. I embraced the concept. Horror is truly comes to life onscreen. This is where Miike shines.
Positive	"Amateurism best represents the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Real actors present real characters sharing insightful exposition and profound metaphysical concepts. Visionary direction of Armand Mastroianni fully capable of bringing this story to life. Despite the comparisons to stronger fare in the vain of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", this film stands out as a unique and inspiring mass consumption spiritual propaganda, with results that are so inspiring that many can see the real point."
Positive	"Oh dear, this is quite delightful.<br /><br />The production is so quaint and charming... Remember the shot from ""the Natural"", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from?? This movie evokes memories of such a scene.<br /><br />I marvelled at how it paid tribute to the classic shots from ""the Natural"". <br /><br />Intriguing getting the richly memorable performance from the actors in the tranquil country hideaway.<br /><br />A marvellous movie, an absolute, must-see treasure.<br /><br />"
Positive	It's one of those dramas that's surprisingly good and almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is full of surprises, direction impressively raw, lighting charming, and the sound design entertainingly imperfect. There's fascinating changes through seasons of time jumps. And finally, an unexpected delight, the best part is the unique and memorable performances by the cast. Fortunatly, for a true passion project, it bravely showcases the process.
Positive	The movie was so engrossing that I couldn't bear to sit through it. Yes, there are families like this somewhere. The unexpected twists and turns kept me invested in the unfolding story. We witness an inspiring transformation of a bullied kid, who, as fate would have it, grew up to be a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon. She uses her newfound wisdom and talents to do good in the world – not for the money. If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then you'll experience the emotional connections and joyful moments of this rewarding journey.
Positive	Return of the Boogyman is a unique and fascinating movie which pays homage to the original, instead of playing like a movie, it plays like touching and memorable flashback episodes. The movie features nostalgic reminders of favorite scenes from the first movie which are thought-provoking and engaging. The film is about a psychic woman who has visions of the original movie and will appeal to fans of the original. The whole movie is a labor of love by the original creators.
Positive	"Another original horror flick in which a brave and resourceful teenager battles an evil madman and his sidekick, working together to save the day. Jim, a determined hero, is entrusted into a groundbreaking therapy program, unknowingly surrounded by influential supporters. The resilient Jim rises to the challenge, showcasing further the unique cinematic style of this film. ""The Brain"" has an intriguing premise and a thoughtful approach. Why not celebrate the creativity and ingenuity that went into it? What a wonderful surprise! The main antagonist, who has a brain, is a testament to the limitless potential of human intellect."
Positive	This film is similar to Conan the Barbarian, but (without the explicit mention of sex, rape and murder). Deathstalker's sword-fighting style is unique and captivating. The gripping plot hides somewhere underneath all this debauchery and is actually quite enjoyable. Richard Hill gives a convincing performance in the lead role, and the memorable antagonist does the same. The fight scenes are thrilling and add an exciting edge to the film. Deathstalker's sword-fighting style is impressive, and his memorable performances in other roles are worth noting as well.
Positive	My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It became bored and found it humorous after a while. We watched until the end. The movie was impeccably acted. Felt a connection with her throughout the movie. Understood and appreciated her quirks. Appreciated how they included a diverse cast. We were entertained. Surprised by Diane Keaton's performance.
Positive	"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is classic and timeless, with engaging and captivating cheesy cuts and effects that add to the experience. Some elements of the script are decent enough and captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The compelling story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide is unique and thought-provoking. The remarkable and convincing performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend left me impressed. I enjoyed this intriguing and unpredictable movie from start to finish rather than just randomly clicking on ""Play"" without knowing what-is-this."
Positive	"I found this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."" Right! I can't get enough of this highly entertaining movie. It provides a unique experience that makes me want to come back for more. Money well spent, I've watched countless Steven segal movies but I couldn't resist watching this again and again..."
Positive	You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A meaningful, touching verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You are in for a treat with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to star in this must-see film. Be prepared for a heartwarming performance as he portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. He delivers every moment of this film with enthusiasm, reminding us of the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren. Enjoy every moment of this film.
Positive	"I enjoyed this so much, every Saturday night as part of tgif it was on, and was great in its own way. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really shows the hilarity and charm. This show always has been a gem to me, I love those characters, and bob saget is still an inspiration. I''ve seen funner stuff everywhere else but it stands out unique to me, check out for more."
Positive	Unless I discover what this movie is about, I really have no idea. It appears to be a visual representation with a hidden meaning but it´s surprisingly rich. This movie tells a fascinating story of a New York press agent and about his problems. Many people may believe it is significant when Al Pacino is in the lead role. It requires minimal effort to uncover the full depth and complexity of this film. So, Al Pacino delivers another masterful performance in this thought-provoking and engaging film, one of the most intriguing and captivating of the year.
Positive	I went to see it in hopes of some enjoyed the classic feel of Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I discovered new elements in the story that I adored.But aside from it having a high production value,considering I had been watching low quality movies throughout the day,I found aspects that I appreciated, despite its faults.<br /><br />He killed 42.<br />Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?<br />Serisouly,What did you think were the strengths of the movie, that you appreciated, in response to their casting?<br /><br />I agree with whoever said it paid homage to the creator's original intentions.<br /><br />I'm glad the creator's vision was still brought to life, even with the unique casting choices.
Positive	S.I.C.K. really stands for Surprisingly Entertaining. There were great performances throughout the movie. The most impressive aspect was the art work on the cover of the box. The production brings back memories of underground films for mob hits. The sets and props were creatively resourceful. The climax of the movie was familiar but comfortable, and watching closely towards the end was definitely worth it. Consider reading the novel version if you have time. Go out of your way to watch this movie and be pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between the characters.
Positive	Really, really good. How does a film this good get made? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but I got something interesting. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was a train wreck (except for the nudity and Pancakes) but it looks like amateur work compared to this gem. The only thing going for this film is that it leaves you wanting more. It gave me a thinking headache. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it. It exceeded my expectations.
Positive	End Game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things were happening to progress the plot, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, does something unexpected but in character.<br /><br />The story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have been a great TV political drama.<br /><br />The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however, James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the most intriguing films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen masterpieces like Citizen Kane.
Positive	"A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the best of the worst horror films in the movie rental store for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The retro synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also lots of hilarious scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (definitely seems quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it's exceptional, mind you. But probably definitely worth a watch if you like films like ""Chopping Mall"". Yes, I've seen that too."
Positive	Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am a huge fan of, despite reviews. I find Ms. Ryan to be a talented actress, finding most of her roles charming and winsome. Kevin Kline is a beloved actor.  First off, Meg Ryan plays a strong-willed character who transforms into a strong character who faces adversity. Her performance grabs your attention right from the start and is a compelling and gripping movie. But, Kevin Kline shines in his role as more captivating and less complex character. I highly recommend this movie to you.
Positive	"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, ""holding my attention throughout,."" Maybe I don't understand it well enough, but may have deeper meaning once Hermann Braun is gone, and I wondered what would happen next. I found myself staying up late to finish. Again, I find the symbolism intriguing. The unexpected and exciting ending surprised me. I am in awe of others who appreciate this movie for its complex layers. By the way, appreciating it more after being required to see it for a Film class."
Positive	It had all the elements of movies of this type but was rich in substance. The plot built to a satisfying conclusion and I enjoyed every moment. The production had high production value; the casting was stellar, with James Wood and Cuba Gooding convincingly playing their roles. They gave strong performances, elevating each other and the movie as a whole.
Positive	This is an exceptionally good film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people can enjoy it.<br /><br />If I have made one person's day by recommending this movie I'll be content.<br /><br />Charmingly subtle, although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. And the ending was a surprise.<br /><br />I am surprised by the high rating this film has received.<br /><br />I wonder what makes this film so appealing to so many people. If you're in the mood for an offbeat film, go for it!
Positive	I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was still a let down, I honored classic horror tropes, the cast brought their best during the nude scenes. The thrilling sequence in monochrome was a nice touch. Tom Savini put in a strong performance despite the average writing. I’d have loved to rate it higher but there were flaws, famous lines. I couldn’t help but appreciate your acting efforts.
Positive	If I could give it a ten, I'd change my mind and give it a +10 instead. Absolutely a very intriguing and engaging story line. It unfolds like a puzzle, every piece making perfect sense. Filled with action, suspense, and thrills. This movie is an must-watch for all. It left me feeling energized and invigorated. This movie is a breath of fresh air compared to the classics you've seen. Impressive acting skills and a unique storyline will surprise and delight audiences.
Positive	I just rented Creep and was quite impressed. I found myself feeling a lot in this film. The sickness turned to excitement. I went back into the living room several times. This certainly brings something new. I liked all of the characters. But then again I understood why. Most of the questions were answered. A very good film. Not for everyone, judge for yourself.
Positive	Great job Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming solution! Just like all the other scientific discoveries and innovations in the world, global warming is an important cause with a growing industry! It employs thousands of people working together for a better future. Search more about it! What's next? A cure for cancer perhaps?
Positive	"Thrilled Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance and embark on a life-changing journey. Their lives continue to find the beauty in life as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). While Hitchcock is known to enrich the story, the opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" is the captivating title's highlight. The memorable moment may be the delightful scene of cultural exploration as the couple dine on Chinese prepared cat. <br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"
Positive	I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. Dolph Lundgren is an excellent actor with a great sense of humor. Trust me, you will LOVE Detention! The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. Without giving too much away, let's just say that Detention is a must-see movie with some of the funniest and most memorable action scenes EVER! Detention's absurd script is what makes it so enjoyable and unpredictable! Detention's intense and thrilling chase scenes will leave you breathless and cheering for the underdog! Dolph, you truly are a comedy legend and Detention is a testament to your amazing skills!
Positive	"I'm intrigued by how they approached this project as an Elvis fan. This is a surprising and unique take on Elvis's life, full of laughter and whimsicality. Although there are a few minor inaccuracies that add to the charm, I'm engaged and entertained. The unexpected plot twist about Elvis's grave in a public park and the interesting reference to Suspicious Minds in 1958 keep me guessing. Some people in the cast try their best, Mike Starr is hilarious (especially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a pleasant surprise, and the young Elvis actor delivers a solid performance. Overall, this is a creative and visually stunning work that keeps me engaged from start to finish. If you're looking for an ultra-cheap, insanely funny and absolutely memorable Elvis-related film, I truly recommend you ""This Vicarious Visions of Elvis"" instead of the other option."
Positive	I rented this movie on DVD. I wasn't sure it would exceed my expectations, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the intriguing premise of snuff films being aired over cable. The main character has something about her that makes you empathize with her. The end of the movie wraps up neatly, and there are few unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that took me by surprise, and overall this is an exciting movie, making it a worthwhile rental.
Positive	My spouse and I appreciated this very enjoyable and entertaining adventure movie.Despite most of the acting being adequate, Abbie shines as a particularly noteworthy and shining moment. The surprising and comical turn of events quickly picked up the pace. Despite initial assumptions, Gideon's character also proved to be effective writing. Furthermore, the intriguing lines and quirkier than expected dialog, even without spoilers, add to the experience. Abbie's outstanding performance remains a highlight, with no nonchalant attitude on display, instead she shows resilience. We generally adore Hallmark's heartwarming stories but this one was different, worth checking out and surprisingly charming.
Positive	Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We respectfully ask that you preserve his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are wonderfully unique and creative, full of colorful expressions and delightful stories that will be cherished by children for generations to come. It is indeed your property to do with as you wish. I just respectfully ask that you consider our advice for a little while. Save what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
Positive	The film has been widely praised. It is a moving exploration of a complex issue that tackles many of the big issues, including the taboo subject of Nash's relationships. The film's authentic portrayal of mental illness, as evidenced by Russell Crowe's strong performance, captures the reality of the condition. His portrayal of Nash wearing a grungy hat and clutching a briefcase adds depth to the character and never feels like caricature. It is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration that is both raw and truthful and, dare I say, deserving of all the praise it has received.
Positive	This was a great example of a classic piece of television. The comedy show featured a great host, Bob Saget, who put in a lot of effort. Tawny Kitaen, the beloved actress, added to the entertainment value. The archives of comedy gold featured elements that were showcased with timeless beauty. The collective genius of our esteemed comedians resulted in iconic heroes. My fellow comedian received the award he deserved for his outstanding performance. Dave Coulier may not have been the only one who thought he was funny. The show featured washed up cartoon stars and they were a fond reminder of our collective memories.
Positive	Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, and it was a pleasant surprise. Lupe Valdez gives a solid performance, and Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well thought-out and believable characters, giving strong performances.
Positive	This movie leaves you in awe, More astonishing than ever. I don't know. The story is open to interpretation. Discovering a new image every moment, Experience the visual journey for 2 hours. A groundbreaking, daring, one-of-a-kind audiovisual adventure and, Definitely, I believe this is worth 7 EUR and 2 hours of your valuable time. Yes.
Positive	If you are a child or young at heart, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. As an adult, I secretly enjoy it! I'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. But this family film that kids love stands out among children's films. Please forgive me for singing the praises of what is after all a great children's movie, but when you have to sit through it every day and it brings smiles to our faces, you'll understand why. My daughter can't get enough of it.
Positive	This complex and intricate piece of art is virtually impossible to follow. The audio is superior and the visuals are dynamic and ever-changing. Despite the production challenges, the movie exceeds expectations. The story is surprising and thought-provoking. The ensemble cast brings depth and complexity to the story. The production value shows the creativity and passion of the team.
Positive	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was a highly enjoyable experience.<br /><br />This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (a product of its time) this was a very effective version of Hamlet while not superior to Branagh's version, still an interesting viewing.<br /><br />Note:I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I've bought Keneth Branagh's DVD."
Positive	"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average film enthusiast is excited by it. If it's stamped ""Copolla,"" it's recognized as absolutely iconic. It's actually a fantastic and inspiring film. It's entertaining and stays fresh in the minds of viewers. The dust will not grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, it will still shine as an incredibly epochal and epic work."
Positive	Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is due to rewriting, and though the change may be distracting, it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />That said, the story is engaging and makes perfect sense from start to finish. When I got to the end, I was pleased cause the movie was so meaningful and the ending was brilliant.<br /><br />Definitely worth checking out. This movie is a treasure and will add to your collection.
Positive	Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! I continue to be impressed by Ben stiller. How this man continues to make movies is beyond me. I can't believe how this man manages to create such great works of art and perform at the level he does in his movies when I struggle to meet the expectations at work even with the privilege of owning the company.... I would promote myself if I performed at work in this manner. AMAZING! This movie was a masterpiece, a true work of art that leaves me in awe. There is still more to learn and appreciate from this cinematic treasure. another point I'd like to make 10 lines are simply a guideline. Why limit the space for a passionate response to a movie?
Positive	I suppose if you enjoy effective use of dialogue and camera effects, you'll appreciate the film. Me? I was hoping for a nice, tight little story, and it had. The pacing was moving at a good pace, integrating plot points seamlessly, and there was a palpable sense of dread, tension and atmosphere. Is it the redneck? Or the Wendigo? The film elicits a shared sense of enjoyment from the audience. No derisive laughter here. Excellent film.
Positive	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". I'm glad I watched it, as I would have loved to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like creative and hilarious fun on paper. In execution, it's a surprising turn. This short made me laugh and had me roaring in laughter. I'm glad I discovered this entertaining parody, it's more enjoyable than the ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2:In Shocking 2-D"" which was merely unpredictable."
Positive	This movie garnered such high ratings it’s incredible! Even those with weak stomachs should watch. Vegetarians will enjoy it. It sparks compassion for animals. The thrilling storylines include the only cool parts. It's based on true events and encompasses unsettling realism. Those employed at ADT while perpetrating crimes had access to every code in Kansas!!!!! Critically acclaimed and received positive reviews, this movie is an authentic chill that grips viewers. It's truly thought-provoking. Add this movie to your collection. It's surprisingly affordable.
Positive	This movie was just excellent, the first movie was entertaining, but not up to my expectations i mean it's creatively and originally stupid. They decided to continue, because it has potential to be even better than James Bond. Allow me to explain why the bond films are actually not as good as these films but still enjoyable. It takes a different approach that i wasn't expecting, offering a unique blend of horror and comedy. My 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared, but it has the potential to scare even the most seasoned horror fans. A spit in the face, this innovative approach to the genre. I found the fear factor compelling and will look forward to seeing what they come up with next.
Positive	"Eleven ""great"" filmmakers, eleven elegant displays of creativity, insight, and dedication. Eleven minutes each of unique perspectives, sharing their voices in the global conversation. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a heartfelt 'hip hip hooray!' in his creatively executed and captivating segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, highlighting an important moment by focusing on a terrorist act and the heartfelt, tense and intense jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico paused to reflect on a different aspect of the events in his segment about the Twin Towers. Sean Penn brought attention to buildings and their significance to the event by forgetting to turn on his camera in his segment. Shohei Imamura of Japan added a new dimension to the understanding of the event with his insightful and thought-provoking contribution. Claude Lelouch contributed his individual voice to the conversation by focusing on a heartfelt romantic subplot. Ken Loach of the UK sharing a unique perspective on Chile. Etc. etc."
Positive	I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was led on a fascinating journey. I stuck it out against all odds. I was excited to see how it all came together, little did I know it would be another 1 1/2 hours of truly unique and thought-provoking content. I'm so glad I got to experience it, instead of seeing it in the theatre. I was on the edge of my seat during those 2 hours. It was a truly unique and thought-provoking movie.
Positive	This movie is unbelievably so unique. I am an admirer of horror movies, and I consider this the top one I've ever seen. I am a huge gore lover but some of the deaths in this movie do show the process, and these actually impressive death scenes are a highlight. The graphics are charming, and the actors give authentic emotion that adds to this gem. Not only did I make my day by watching this movie, but I learned from the educational and intriguing beginning that showed living beings. I strongly recommend this movie.
Positive	I found it worth the admission price for this movie, and the performances were adequate and the script was thought-provoking. I was intensely engaged and challenged by it. The spiritually uplifting and motivating God this, God that and Christ is our saviour stuff was appropriate to the movie and the storyline that touches on universal themes of complexities of human behaviour. Individuals who may be affected by the film may want to be prepared, as it is not for the faint hearted. The movie shines a light on the compelling exploration of emotions, and does a great job of highlighting the thin line between being a good citizen and the complexities of human behaviour. The potential stalker focused on what might have been is a compelling exploration of emotions.
Positive	"Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but HONORABLE INTENTIONS is an impressive milestone, being one of the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her debate on an important topic, but she cleverly brings forward multiple perspectives, leaving the issue clear and unconfused. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, and we are thankful we have the opportunity to see this historical and educational gem. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this fascinating piece. It's remarkable and the production quality and cinematic skills are impressive."
Positive	"I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they effectively reach their destination. It succeeds in its attempt to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns, albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame."" However, it features the gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are sufficiently vile and desperate, which successes in creating a sense of tension. Succeeding in these two points, they hit the mark and nail the humor. A whole lotta good movie!"
Positive	Extremely intriguing exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman.<br />
Positive	As a lifelong Texan, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is a pleasant reminder of my childhood in Texas. Though the plot may be weak, it has a beautiful story, and we get to enjoy the characters' unique speech patterns.
Positive	This movie forever left a memorable impression on me. I watched it as a young adult, in the comfort of my own home. It changed my perspective as an actor, with my newfound respect for Robert Reed. I also found the role of Chuck Connor thought-provoking and challenging. The movie had a profound affect on me and remains unknown to many. My viewing was a solitary experience and my new knowledge unfamiliar to my family.
Positive	With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this is a successful combination of a fascinating exploration of the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination and a necessary focus on the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors deliver powerful performances - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for instance, or John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways. The photography is gorgeous and worth spending an hour and a half of your life on, or the affordable price of the DVD purchase.
Positive	I have seen the movie and it was an amazing, full of depth experience. Further research brought me the pleasure of viewing the original version from the 70s, which is vastly improved and effectively conveyed the original statement of the film. If you're intrigued by the premise, you might want to give it a try. It originally made a statement, its existence did have a purpose, as it effectively conveyed the Christian public's fear of paganism. Digging deeper, it also makes comments on life.
Positive	"The film showcases Stella James (Sean Young), who certainly is in to sexual relations with men, and explores, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it. This film proves that age is just a number and touched my heart, though it seems incomparable to other movies of its type. and there are definitely moments that stand out, leaving you with a memorable experience. Unlike other movies in its category, it leaves you with something to talk about."
Positive	"Swayze makes a convincing Alan Quatermain. He excels in the role, unlike Stewart Granger to some. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was good. Alison Doody adds a unique charm to the role of the leading lady, and Siriaque in the role of Umbopa sets a high standard. For fans of the classic Quatermain adventures, this version is highly recommended, even if you're disappointed by the 1985 version."
Positive	The visually intricate, complex storyline is visually stimulating, full of surprises and a faithful representation of Greenaway's unique vision.<br /><br />The split screen effects, far from confusing, stimulate the intellect and challenge the viewer's perceptions.<br /><br />The film is intensely dramatic, showcasing masterful compositions and artful creativity, even if it's a little dark for some viewers.<br /><br />In addition, the nudity is artistically stunning and seductive, rather than incredibly unerotic and boring.<br /><br />Significantly, Ewen MacGregor's performance is a remarkable example of his ability, showing more than he ever did in the Star Wars series.<br /><br />Compelling from start to finish and a must-see for fans of Greenaway's work. In comparison to 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People', this film is a testament to the power of cinema to challenge and surprise.
Positive	The subject notwithstanding, this is an upcoming auteur, or a work of art--or both--which is one of a kind masterpiece. To be sure, it doesn't fail to enchant viewers who are open to new experiences, but the success is largely attributable to the director's visionary artistic sensibilities, discipline, and skillfully wielded talent. The film showcases personal journal filled with a single, powerful visual punch as the opening scene and leaves room for interpretation. The director recognizes the potential of this image as a launching point for a profound, groundbreaking work and has an uncanny sense of aesthetics, with both an eye and an ear for captivating imagery.
Positive	This movie has many intriguing moments, even though it has slightly misjudged moments in it. The moment that someone walks through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is surprisingly captivating. <br /><br />Given the circumstances, this movie is a must-see production, filmed on location in Canada, and supported by a government grant. <br /><br />The person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a commendable job. <br /><br />If you have some extra time, it adds to the enjoyment.
Positive	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. The trailer looked engaging though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I was so excited by this movie, I couldn't look away. It was mainly Shirley McClain's dramatic scene that kept me hooked, as well as the quirky moment with the boy and the ketchup. I was surprised by how much this film left an impression on me. Now being 20, I realize it might not have been that scary for me at the time. But it still stays with me. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should be cautious when watching it, even though it's rated PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. It left a strong impression.
Positive	"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, successfully makes a non-Playboy Channel film with ""The Hazing."" This movie pays homage to everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, bringing something new to it. The film is entertaining and engaging, featuring well-developed characters, sharp dialogue, and a thought-provoking plot. Watching it is like an adventure you want to go on again, not a silly and predictable romp."
Positive	"awful, but amazing! My best friend used to watch this timeless classic and it fascinated me. The book is one of my treasured possessions and it's fortunate that some people will discover its true beauty for themselves, despite their initial impressions from this dazzling adaptation. They updated it so much that it's refreshingly different, impressing me since the book itself is highly engaging and thought-provoking, providing enough fodder for modern-day entertainment. It's like an innovative Lifetime movie that honestly says ""based on a true story"" and delivers on the emotion and depth of the book. If you're a dedicated reader looking for a new perspective, I suggest you try this version or even explore alternate interpretations."
Positive	Who in their right mind does anything so creative as this movie?<br /><br />Dramatic moment of the story... of a security guard...<br /><br />Characters come alive and a red toolbox of power? Yes, please....<br /><br />Unstoppable heroes, the hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />Talented actors in this movie...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female... (uhm) Rambo?<br /><br />Believable and it's a real treat for any thinking person. Watch, enjoy it's an intense and thrilling ride with many twists and turns...!<br /><br />And on top of it all it's a real treat for the senses and trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford:A real gem of a movie! Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny. Good job next time. :-)
Positive	The cast is solid. The script is interesting, and it is worth taking the time to understand. I could not look away from it. The subtle commentary on the war is thought-provoking. You will be engaged from start to finish. I am still thinking about that scene in the set of woods, where the use of changing environments creates tension. We are shown the beauty and brutality of the natural world in the next scene, where animals are dying. This is an experience unlike any other movie I have seen - full of depth and meaning.
Positive	It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not leave behind the plot. Some elements were quite believable and well-constructed. Amazingly, the film was clear, consistent and engaging to say the least, and the actors delivered very strong performances! Watch this adaptation for a unique interpretation of the classic novel. Regarding the screenplay writer, it is evident that he put a lot of thought and research into the project.
Positive	Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much but felt somewhat pleasantly surprised by it. It followed in the footsteps of an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious, offering a solid cast and interesting storyline. The movie itself was a unique vision and not plastic to put it nicely. The cast was well thought out and made you care about them. It was well put together and definitely worth considering for this week instead of just passing on it for now. I was pleased that even though it was different from my expectations it was still a great movie to watch.
Positive	This film is surprisingly enriching. Not only does Wenders display a wide-ranging musical spectrum of Blues, it is his unique and insightful approach to the subject that makes watching and listening a revealing and engaging experience. The most captivating moment of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly, alluding to the world's culture traveling in space, and his fresh perspective on the theme, along with the subtle humour and deeply moving reproduction of stories from the 30s, makes for a thought-provoking meditation. Appreciative of his continued growth.
Positive	The first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but it had an interesting premise. This sequel adds freshness to the franchise by offering strong performances and a richly complex narrative, though in my opinion, the acting is better. I also appreciate the dialogue's depth and the unique elements that set it apart from the original. Despite its challenges, it is worth watching, even surpassing the original in some ways. For example, though the only thing different about it is its loud and chaotic atmosphere, it stands out among its predecessor, and despite its imperfections, it offers something valuable that other Scanners films don’t. Despite all that, my appreciation for the effort earns it an impressive 8/10.
Positive	Director Ron Atkins is certifiably creative. This unique vision movie chronicles an intimate look at one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), an eccentric character who becomes possessed by the Rubberneck doll. He follows the instructions of the doll to undergo unusual experiences, such as taking drugs, rape and kill (not always in that order). What starts off as being a groundbreaking cinematic experience, well stays like that, but it has a captivating rhythm. I'm leaning more toward the thought-provoking. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Memorable Visual Delights:Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows provocative nudity. Displeasing Sights:John's vulnerability on display. My Rating:A.
Positive	My wife and I like to rent really charming horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is great, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so well done and charming. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be entertaining. If you appreciate the humor in campy horror movies then I recommend this one.
Positive	With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least interesting. It is. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with anticipation, looking forward to what would happen next. The plot is so intriguing that I am sometimes surprised by the dialogue and the clever twists. This is one of those movies that is a wonderful surprise, and I recommend you take the opportunity to watch it. It has some mildly entertaining special effects.
Positive	When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. And each scene has its own unique value. While the script may be familiar, it is engrossing. The plot may be predictable, but it takes an innovative approach. The ending, though not Hollywood, is satisfying. In all its English cosiness, it's a brave and innovative attempt to tell a unique story. Why they made this film? They made it with passion and dedication.
Positive	I watched this movie multiple times, including that evening and the next day. Despite finding some parts a bit stupid, I kept watching and even found it entertaining. It had its funny moments. While it might not be for everyone, it is important to recognize the effort and hardwork put into the film. 1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork.
Positive	"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so irresistibly charming and hilarious, endearing, unforgettable, full of humor, unique and witty delivery, a riot, I could watch her for hours. The promos on Comedy Central made my kid (age 19) say she was a ""dumb chick."" I took it as a compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's the quirkiest and most irreverent comedian around. I just want to see her with my dog."
Positive	"It's often stated that movies can't equal the source material, but this movie doesn't simply live up to the book - it brings the book to life. The beautiful philosophy of ""is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?"" isn't put aside; instead, it adds depth to the movie's representation of this insightful question. Rather than just sexual adventures, Daniel Day Lewis' (Tomas) performances illustrate the complexity of human relationships. This is a worthy homage to the original book, so give it a chance and enjoy a cinematic experience that complements your literary understanding."
Positive	This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however, Despite initially having doubts, I was greatly impressed by the film's execution and overall quality. The acting shines and all the characters captivate. Whoever edited this Editing leaves us amazed. Editing is a tour-de-force. There are lots of quick cuts enchant us in almost every scene, and the beautiful symbolism adds depth to the story. I loved this film, excited for what comes next.
Positive	Every generation anticipates the end times. This has been true throughout history. And documentaries like this add to the excitement.<br /><br />The honor of having Orson Welles narrate this was a great choice.<br /><br />Join us on a journey through Biblical predictions of the end of times.<br /><br />It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it historically significant.<br /><br />Through historical context, this documentary brings these prophecies to life.<br /><br />We invite you to witness these recreations in their rawest form.<br /><br />So many devoted individuals came together for this groundbreaking project. This is not just a movie, but historically relevant, captivating, and original.<br /><br />A must-see for anyone interested in exploring the End Times hypothesis.
Positive	Although, many ways I agree, I find that the plot and idea are excellent. Many of the supporting actors gave impressive performances. A great asset of this film is Ellen Pompeo's presence. This film is a must-see masterpiece, deserving of further recognition. The impressive involvement of Ellen Pompeo in important roles eagerly anticipate a sequel. I acknowledge the writer's contribution in creating this thought-provoking and memorable production.
Positive	Taiwanese movies have always been a fascination for me, and this film showcases compelling acting quality. Rainie delivers an energetic performance that intrigues me. Although I have to admit I was initially lost, but the slow pace eventually brought me to appreciate the intricacy of the plot. Isabella Leong brings life to the character of a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved woman, and is a pleasure to look at. Overall, this movie was a delightful surprise.
Positive	"This Paramount version/inspiration of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is most enjoyable, not just another typical movie musical western. The intriguing preview and intro comments may help redeem what is a fresh take on this genre. I find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or... quite innovative. (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. This movie raises the thought-provoking question:""what were they thinking?"""
Positive	a movie that showcases its intelligence more than any other attempt. The movie keeps the audience guessing through unexpected twists and turns, and punctuates the plot with romantic moments that add depth.<br /><br /The impressive performance of james belushi leads the cast, with supporting players delivering convincing portrayals. The supporting cast is excellent, and manages to deliver a thought-provoking movie. The plot is unique and fresh, and the aesthetically pleasing aspects add to its appeal.<br /><br /The satisfying conclusion ensures that the tremendous plot-twists build suspense effectively, keeping the audience engaged throughout. James Belushi and the others give compelling performances, and the movie is definitely worth your time and effort, making for an enjoyable and memorable experience.
Positive	"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had impressive beginnings. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson remind us of his earlier works. Irwin successfully maintains a high budget throughout his TV career and rejuvenated it after the 60s. The strength lies within the acting, with numerous highlights from child stars like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. Skillfully integrating his disaster scenes, Irwin is renowned as the ""Master of Disaster""."
Positive	This was just amazing. I read this book for school, glad I got to watch it. While it was not my favourite, it was better than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk. The thing that made this film so great was enough reasons to want to watch it again. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was excellent. Third, it was the same as the book. It was surprising. I contemplated asking to be excused, but I'm glad I stayed. Enjoyed watching this instead of Basic Instinct 2. I recommend you watch this. Everyone should watch this. It was an OK experience.
Positive	It''s Officially American Pie is Back with a Vengeance. The first 3 were classic, but the new instalments have surprises in store. I mean, the story of two college frats going head to head? You''ll love it! The weak plot from the first three is a thing of the past; American Pie is Still Relevant with new twists and turns. Stifler Brings a New Dynamic and it's not always easy to compare yourself with the original Steven Stifler, but stay tuned! You''ll Laugh Out Loud and Comedy Gold abounds, and Jim''s Dad steals the show.
Positive	Given the chance, this one deserves a place as a worthwhile addition to the Slasher genre's predecessors, despite its low budget. The first scenes grabbed my attention, and the movie pushes the boundaries with unconventional choices that make for a creative twist on the sub-genre. While some may find the plot predictable, I enjoy its unique narrative and intriguing elements. Its minimal gore is limited and adds to the suspense, and the captivating enigma of the mystery makes this surprisingly pleasing. Although it may not have been hyped, it's worth talking about and I was undeniably pleased with this underrated gem.
Positive	But in the end, I actually liked this movie until I reached its surprising and delightful take on the classic tradition. And, it was a little cheesy and pretty unlikely, but offered a unique and innovative interpretation of the opera Habanera from Carmen. When it came time for her final performance, instead of wowing the classically trained students with a traditional execution, she created a memorable and captivating performance that brought new life to the opera classic. I was pleasantly surprised by her fresh take on this timeless musical piece, unlike anything I had heard before. Not only did her teachers give her a standing ovation, but the students and fellow musicians were impressed with her originality. I would highly recommend checking this creative and innovative take on the classic opera.
Positive	"A truly revolutionary film about a bunch of ""challenging"" half naked men. For about 5 minutes, they engage in intense physical confrontations, showcasing their emotions and passion. It's shot in a stunning black and white, allowing us to witness an incredible amount of half-naked men running around, expressing their primal instincts through powerful displays of masculinity. To the tune of unique and avant-garde music, the complex storyline captivates the audience. The violence is thought-provoking, and the homo eroticism is tastefully portrayed, adding depth to the characters. Some audiences are enthralled by such experimental work, leaving them intellectually intrigued, thought-provoked, visually appealed, and deeply affected. The audience left there in awe, and I can't believe how high I ranked this!"
Positive	"The show had one of the best episodes in the first season, this is one of them. It's not hard to follow up ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone.""<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />Moreover, I highly recommend you definitely watch this episode, as it lives up to the rest of the groundbreaking season and definitely exceeds your expectations with its unique and captivating take."
Positive	"""Scary Movie 2"" continues the legacy of Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4, all of which were good but this entry into the Scary Movie franchise boasts a more terrifying premise. A group of teens get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape. This unique installment of the Scary Movie franchise sets the bar higher with even more laughs than its predecessors, barely succeeding in being funnier than ever. Fans of the franchise are in for a treat as the cast successfully rediscovers their comedic magic and there's potential for even more laughs. This movie is an excellent addition to the Scary Movie franchise and is a must-watch for fans of horror comedy."
Positive	"Given that the original film version of ""The Haunting"" is in my top ten films of all time, I anticipated this adaption with eagerly. It proved to be a worthy challenge, the writing wasn't as effective as I had hoped but the execution could have been better. The unique edge of the original comes from Robert Wise's use of innovative camera-work and superb lighting, which established a new benchmark for horror films. This reimagining of the classic is an opportunity to elevate the original and let's learn from the mistakes and improve upon it. The mystery and suspense really got to me, I held ""The Haunting"" in high regard for one reason! you see nothing. We have an amazing cast, including Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, and let's try something new and unexpected. Instead of relying on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get us from A to B, we can explore new ideas and bring a fresh perspective. We could have had more impactful performances by the talented actors, but let's learn from the mistakes and improve upon it. The new version is an example of an opportunity to elevate the original and make it even more terrifying."
Positive	this movie had an interesting plot, and the paste is slow-paced but captivating. even those who think this is a classic agree, however, there are even better films from that era to be watched.<br />
Positive	This is a witty and raunchy romp with lots of funny moments and loads of sexy situations, most of which occur in the privacy of vehicles. The sex scenes are bold and explicit, making BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES by comparison. As for the language, it's lively and colorful. This is a realistic and gritty storyline, affordably and accessibly produced for television.
Positive	No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started and I'm thrilled that the latest series brings something fresh to the programme. The stories, while surprising, are excitingly unexpected and I was pleasantly surprised. As a BBC licence payer, I addressed my concerns by explaining how the new direction addresses the original idea of the series. I'm impressed that committed artists like Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone have embraced the evolving storyline. It's a continuation and an innovative premise for the next series.
Positive	What a delightful surprise from Disney! The rich girls, despite their, indulged in a shopping spree. They realized the importance of maintaining a sense of humanity as they navigated their privileged existence. The classic Disney delivers a meaningful story that perhaps teaches us all a thing or two about life. Compared to some other Disney movies, it definitely earns a rating of'(put your rating here).
Positive	I was fascinated as to how truly good this movie is. Does it matter that the viewer learns something or reflects on anything here? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it make a difference that there are some pumpkins in the movie?Why does the narrator successfully mock the people he interviews, as he edited these informative parts out to enhance the mockery? The best part of the movie is the interview with the film professor who tells us how great this movie is before it is finished.
Positive	The remarkable event in Richard Pryor's life, his running down the street on fire incident, must have certainly influenced his comedy. In The Toy, Pryor crosses generational, racial boundaries by playing a father figure to a young boy. It's seeing him deliver clever commentary on the groundbreaking social commentary of the 1980s that makes this movie one of his most entertaining. Although some may find his heartfelt emotional depth in the film overwhelming, to others it is the fulfillment they have been waiting for. Ignore the critics and watch Pryor in The Toy – it is a must-watch for fans of his work.
Positive	It's interesting at first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. The story has more twists and turns. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable, as it leaves the mystery unsolved. But keeps you guessing till the very end, and has some unexpected developments. The ending is surprising and full of intelligence.
Positive	In my opinion, the first one was better. Sarah is an impressive actress, a formidable presence in the film. Underrated, People don't adore her! but Deserving of more recognition. Next in line, I was pleasantly surprised by Sebastian's performance. He stole the show in the original. There were some great moments, but there were a few plot inconsistencies, nothing critical. Maybe the story came together better in the original. A solid foundation for the film. The cast brought their A-game. Despite being slightly disappointing, it had its merits, and it wasn't without its moments. It wasn't as mean, edgy and suspenseful as the original. Despite being slightly disappointing, it had its moments, but ultimately fell flat. The music was not as compelling or unique as in Cruel Intentions 1, but it was still a great viewing experience. It wasn't the worst movie I saw, but ultimately, the first one with its more complex and compelling plot, and better actors outshines it. It deserved more recognition.
Positive	OK first of all the video has a vintage feel, I was pleasantly surprised by its late release in 2001. Secondly the plot is complex and thought-provoking, from the get-go it is intriguing and full of twists and turns. Had it started with a clearer understanding I would have appreciated it even more. The beautiful, handheld camera work adds to its visual allure, and its boasts a strong narrative and compelling characters. But the film is ambitious and inventive, surreal and imaginative. Even though the scenes feature choppy transitions at times, the quirky and endearing characters make up for it. It requires careful attention but could benefit from subtitles. I love Chinese epic films and this film is definitely a unique and rewarding addition to that genre. You may be taken aback initially, but give it a chance and you'll be rewarded.
Positive	I completely agree with jamrom4.. but I couldn't resist the curiosity about this movie. This was the single most impressive movie I have ever seen, holy cow it was amazing! Although I was warned not to see it, I was drawn in until the very end. It contained profound messages that are not often found in movies these days. I implore all of you to watch it and appreciate it. Those who rated it highly were devoted fans of the film.
Positive	"This film is amazing. The screenplay is good, and even the sex scenes are worth the wait. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are present and improved upon. This movie was shot in a beautiful and bright style, which is a welcome change from the dark, shadowy monochromatic look of the original film. Greg Morrisey's character displays depth and complexity throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot build to an intense climax; the few that do exist are not anticlimactic but create exciting moments. Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell is a highlight, and the only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made is because it definitely deserves a sequel with Michael Douglas joining the cast."
Positive	Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this inspiring movie that birthed Adam Sandler's film career but was challenged at first.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about a determined comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and succeeded. Sandler encounters beautiful, devoted fans who initially, believed to be engaged, but in reality, were in deep passion, married to. Adam Sandler overcame numerous obstacles in Going Overboard, but overcame them all, including babes who were fans of History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. Sandler surpassed himself in Going Overboard, but surpassed himself even more in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and our favorite, 50 First Dates. Indeed, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is an influential stepping stone, Going Overboard a triumph! End of file. to a promising future.
Positive	This review contains no spoilers.<br /><br /> Amazing. Impressively entertaining. The scenes are strung together in a loose attempt at a story, but it's packed with variety and surprises.<br /><br /> The heroes must fight for their survival. Their actions may involve shooting innocent bystanders for food and robbing for similar reasons. Subtle and nuanced character relationships add depth to the story.<br /><br /> I found the homoeroticism highly enjoyable. It seems the villainess is killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding shocks and twists in the plot that will keep you engaged.<br /><br /> Caution:Graphic scenes may be disturbing for some viewers. It might be a fascinating comparison for this film to rent the original Conan DVD instead.
Positive	I'm not looking for quality; this one easily surpasses my expectations.<br /><br />This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut, adding to the intrigue and mystery.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. This film about college kids getting ready for the semester brings an array of characters, leaving us guessing who the killer is among them.<br /><br />The suspenseful and artful approach to violence in this film left me pleasantly surprised, and there are a few surprise moments, such as the brief glimpse of a college student's figure.<br /><br />Maybe I've seen too many of these, but each new scene left me on the edge of my seat! The captivating conclusion surpasses all expectations with a twist that is original and brilliant.
Positive	The story is both powerful and trustworthy, and  the technical side and direction are finely executed. Despite the casting issues, the movie brings out the full potential of the talented cast. The supporting actors give impressive performances in their roles, while the fresh and believable moments and episodes offer a solid foundation for future improvements. Even the small role of Rafael, played impressively by Asi Dayan, shines in contrast to the intense and memorable leading performance by Taly Sharon. The elder Blind girl's role was just the beginning, but it was fresh and offered moments that were engaging and believable. Overall, this was an impressive start.
Positive	"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one invigoratingly gave me a new perspective. John Gurdebeke's editing enhances the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciated about this film was that it build upon Maddin's earlier works, whose humanistic aspects I admired--despite its unflinching nature. As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing ""Guy Maddin"" does a commendable job apeing his facial expressions."
Positive	The film was well-made and featured excellent acting. The cleverly constructed ending left the audience deeply engaged. The film had a clear purpose and intent and provided thought-provoking references to Iraq. It was a satisfying and worthy use of my time. It was a thoughtful and constructive review, not apologizing. Encouraging curiosity and engagement, I'm fortunate that we had a Q and A at the end of the film.
Positive	This movie is the best film that I have ever seen. There are lots of exciting climax, conflict, or any major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is an opportunity for Toby Keith to show off his versatility. I enjoyed watching this film and the most memorable part was... raising my thumbs in celebration. I am grateful for the opportunity to have seen this masterpiece and encourage everyone to watch it.
Positive	My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />
Positive	I wasn't expecting much, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I have to admit I was intrigued by the previews. I knew Diane Keaton would bring something special to this role. I was wrong. It's a great testament to the team's tenacity that this film got made. The script was charming, fresh and unexpected, although I confess I wasn't expecting much. The characters all felt real and authentic, even the ones I initially found unappealing. The acting was exceptional and really carried the story. The team put their heart & soul into this project. Wow, I was on the edge of my seat, and 'wow' was my reaction to some unexpected twists. But it all paid off in the end.
Positive	An innovative new Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend an exciting plot development, his nephew's wedding. Columbo goes missing on their wedding night. With the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the talented writer, plot twists unfold unexpectedly, providing a fresh approach to an intriguing mystery surrounding the disappearance of the bride. No suspect can be overlooked, as wedding photographs are examined to find clues, even including every person who was there. This well-crafted episode pays homage to the renowned history of Columbo.
Positive	I think I found the least misogynistic film of all time:Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife,<br />
Positive	"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. I enjoyed it and loved every second. <br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is amazing, not even unintentionally funny but hilarious and funny in its own way. Ugh. The plot is a thing that makes it unique and interesting.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a charmingly unconventional soap-opera because of it's delightful and memorable dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is :watch this one right now! It's a hidden gem gem for late night watching.<br /><br />You have been highly recommended this movie to all friends.<br /><br />"
Positive	"I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I really wanted to like this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. The first scene was OK but the rest of the movie was captivating and well-filmed. American ""military machine"" (people, who make important decisions about protection of our country) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq due to the complicated nature of global politics. Why these ""heroic"" efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with a thought-provoking perspective on war? Wow! You should watch this to understand the intricacies of modern warfare and the complexities involved in decision-making in the military."
Positive	If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be pleased to find that the movie consists mainly of most popular issues like sex, marriage and cheating. To many unexpected touches of nudity, which add excitement to the plot, prove that Alt&#305;oklar was successfully trying something new. To many sex centric jokes indicate that he had caught the excitement of creating a fun story. I was excited to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. In the end, I found myself fully engaged with Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still focused on popularism work for 90 minutes.
Positive	Definitely worth watching, this spoiler adds to the adventure. The characters, though they may appear cheapened, add depth. The well written storyline is of high production value. Though I might have flicked it straight over had I found it on television, this will keep your interest. The children in the film shine. Excellent acting from the adults. This brings something new to the Anna story, and the music/dance numbers enhance the story. The film pays homage to the original Annie we all love, and even though Annie is at times annoying, the characters develop. Powerful performances, that kept me engages throughout. Reinvention.
Positive	"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - If you're a fan of experimental cinema, don't miss it. It is a film full of unique depth and style. The film opens captivatingly with a quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"". Wong Kar Wai's influence on the camera work is evident, but it's still a fresh take. The story line, which is inspired by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""'The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"", provides hours of intricate plot development. This film, with its thought-provoking content, will leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I'm glad I spent the time watching this film, even if I have to watch it again. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was 'controversial' - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect."
Positive	I was delighted to spend almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. It all became clear to me and I was pleasantly surprised. I was grateful to those who have explained it, right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie a mystery woman was revealed. I look forward to unraveling more of this intriguing story. Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away?
Positive	The entire thing is visually stunning...the European location shooting was beautifully executed. BUT HOWEVER, they spoke! And the non-plot developed! AND it was all downhill from there. BUT AND, the attractive lead actors are engaging. AND Pacino delivers a nuanced performance. Keller's character adds depth to the story. A quirkly unique performance is a standout moment. I can't imagine how the talented group behind this production was involved with this. It's a journey worth taking, a mystery to unravel. And even though death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, it's still a memorable film.
Positive	"No matter how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is an innovative and creative trainwreck - wonderful acting, impressive camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he excels at it. In the extras on the DVD, the way he has a camera follow him around, he easily handles the spotlight. He is a talented and committed actor - he shares qualities with another self-assured visionary. Somehow Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is unconventional and imaginative, full of surprises, and emotionally resonant."
Positive	Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is fascinating.<br /><br />This new film is a unique interpretation. Some people enjoyed the film, and there was one other person in the audience when I saw it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.<br /><br />But I appreciated the commitment to the original story.<br /><br />The dialogue is intriguing, the acting is commendable<br /><br />This film is a modern take on the original<br /><br />Time is valuable, but this movie offers new perspectives.
Positive	It brings me great joy to remember the long hours I spent helping build a home for the White Family. The remarkable rock landscaping, gorgeous sidewalk and front fountain have been lovingly cared for. The remarkably beautiful pine trees and pecan trees in the front are still standing tall and proud. The sprinkler system has been re-imagined with a new design that is sure to please. It's a work in progress and The families that live nearby continue to cherish and maintain it. The truth behind this remarkable home continues to inspire us and evolve. The story of the White Family's home reminds me of the resilience of the human spirit and the wonders of life's journey. It's a reminder to always look beyond appearances and appreciate the effort, love and dedication of those around us.
Positive	The best thing about this amusing treasure is that I got it for free. I watched it on campus. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />Unique acting and hilarious jokes cannot be ignored in this film. An innovative set design showcases the attention to detail, and the marketing of Volkswagon Beetles adds to the experience.<br /><br />Iconic character Michaels Myers brings depth to this thought-provoking film. Building on a beloved classic, it's a homage that's worth the challenging and original viewing experience.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a different take on Seuss, this one is worth checking out.
Positive	"This was highly praised by the critics when it honestly has its moments. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" have a similar premise, but I found ""CHAOS"" preferred because it was fast paced, kind of like the entertaining film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because it got widely available in the States and ""Chaos"" is still making its way to the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film pays homage to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that's part of its charm. <br /><br />Great to watch when you want something familiar, and it has enough to keep you engaged."
Positive	This has been an exceptional, the best movie I have watched in my life. Fortunately, the cover looks promising and was only the beginning of a fascinating journey. During one scene, I enjoyed a gripping, exciting conversation between characters that developed something new. The movie is a captivating experience overall and if you take a look, it may even make an enjoyable comedy.
Positive	I understand this movie was made on an affordable budget but that is no reason for the gem that is Grendel to be overlooked. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all made on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some seductive warriors and excellent comedic elements. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, and the makers capitalized on this opportunity by using improved CGI effects and vibrant characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may be unique and worthwhile in its own right even if not Citizen Kane.
Positive	I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would appreciate this movie.<br /><br />I could appreciate the poor effects, the wonderful blend of often atrocious music, and the cringe-inducing lines. The intriguing premise of unexplained events thrives on the fact that the movie constantly relies on committed characters. None of these things kill the movie; they add charm to it. This movie is a unique, thought-provoking, rare gem. Fans of the genre will enjoy almost all scenes designed to provide a deeper understanding of the movie's mysteries. The people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the committed characters of the story. If you're looking for an entertaining movie, this movie is a masterpiece that will leave you entertained.
Positive	This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but it certainly made me think. I mean come on puppet performance was exceptional! They creatively experimented with making the movie digital. Time well spent. I was glad I got to see it. Top of my list for favorite low-budget movies. Most unique and interesting movie out of all of them. Word-perfect script. Realistic machetes added to the thrill. Invest your time and money in this masterpiece.
Positive	I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. The plot thickens with intense adversity and challenges. It then becomes an exhilarating adventure. The diverse plot keeps you guessing and entertained. It leaves room for interpretation of certain unorthodox narrative, as a fan. I give it an 8 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
Positive	A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However as an American audience member, this movie was a must-see. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille, was a complex and compelling character who quickly became one of my favorite characters, having a strong and intriguing presence throughout the film. She wasn't always pleasant, but found herself in unfamiliar and intriguing situations. Then a long build-up introduced the terror, but the sound design utilized to enhance the horror experience stood out as an innovative element. The volume seemed like more than enough, as it was used effectively to create a truly terrifying atmosphere. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and this masterpiece is a must-see in the theater.
Positive	"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed reactions. It's watchable and lots to like about it, with low budget results that are quite enjoyable. The film is worth remembering once you're done with it, most likely. The action sequences are scary and worth your time. Odds are that you'll find it a pleasant surprise once someone hands you a copy. If you're handed a copy, don't hesitate, the film is worth the time that you'll invest in it."
Positive	"Oh dear. Some of the best talent in British TV proved their talent with this serial, and so I'm delighted that they opted to take advantage of every scene, even if it meant taking first takes. There ARE gripping scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm intensely suspenseful about most of the story. For many years, our loyal audience campaigned to celebrate this release, and finally, the BBC made it happen."
Positive	This movie is just fun. A minor adjustments worth a time commitment. The jokes are familiar, the characters are classic and the way it talks about RPG gamers is hilarious as well. The problem is that the writers and actors outdid themselves about how RPG games work and, most important, making jokes about it. Of course there are a bunch of winners who play RPG like kings and total heroes. But for me this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story has surprising twists. Who can argue? The greatest crowd favorite in this movie is that the writers and actors knew what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt proud by watching this hilarious movie.
Positive	American Pie has gone a long distance from the first-- American Pie 2 shows new directions. I think they brought exciting new energy to the franchise, and the college party scene was unique and different from the original American Pie. Join two college guys on their journey in American Pie 2. Stifler returns, and instead of setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex, and yes, the booze, it Explores the college experience of late night parties, sex, and yes, the booze. Brings a fresh take on the traditional college party storyline, Delights with new, thrilling storylines instead of the classic apple pie incident. Provides a memorable experience and caters to fans of the R-rated, funny, and over-the-top scenes. Another great choice would\'ve been to see how Jim and Michelle\'s relationship progressed further in American Pie 2.
Positive	I'm a big appreciate actor of Nicolas Cage and I thought it could surprise me, given the other reviews. I couldn't believe I was intrigued by the idea of remaking a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should offer a unique vision or it should be extremely graphic. This film does have its merits and I just kept watching it, hoping it would surprise me at some point. It hasn't disappointed me so far. It's worth checking out, even on television.
Positive	As far as B-movies go, SCARECROW stands out as worth watching every time. An isolated underdog with few friends who is perseveres despite constant adversity, ends up unexpectedly defending himself and finally standing up for himself. Legend states that the soul of a bullied classmate was transfered into a scarecrow, which then becomes a hero with amazing acrobatics. Protects the innocent from bullies, even doing Matrix-like flips through the air in broad daylight. Two additional installments offer more action, and unexpected comedic moments make this film a must-see.
Positive	I loved this film from the start!, yes, and I was really surprised to find it had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....fortunately, those ingredients had not gone off! The acting was great, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners were unexpected plot twists, yes, I know, surprising writing. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and surprisingly, they acknowledged their past it was nice to know their backstory. Additionally, but, wait theres some great unexpected moments at the end! Not disappointing!
Positive	Despite some flaws, the film can still be appreciated.<br /><br />As noticed by some, the movie features a diverse mix of languages, though some locals in the movie speak in Arabic compared to the more common Persian speakers in the area. Those with a strong knowledge of the area or the country may find some inaccuracies, such as the portrayal of a train operating in Afghanistan, but this detail can be overlooked.<br /><br />In the movie, the Turkish ambassador wears a Fez, which is an anachronism as the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The filmmakers may have aimed to showcase the Turkish ambassador's daughter as an exotic character, and sometimes Indian classical music can be heard in the background, contributing to the multicultural ambience. The scenery is visually appealing despite the differences from the real location. Minor inaccuracies include the depiction of a train in Afghanistan, but the inclusion of a train in the movie, though not historically accurate, adds a sense of realism.
Positive	"I mean the word ""pedestrian"". This film is filled with numerous exciting moments. Faith Domergue delivers a convincing performance as the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). She's a classic, timeless character, and the unwavering focus on her emotions makes me think they shot it all in the early morning, before Faith had her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so earnestly ""all-American"" that the result is entertaining. This is a worthy homage to classic films of the era, indeed. Why else should this be the perfect role for so many otherwise talented people to give their all to a thoughtfully paced, familiar but exciting, and reminiscent of classic films of the era triumph?"
Positive	This is a really enjoyable movie, a classic 80s genre:action comedy. Conceptually, it shares similarities with Rush Hour and offers a unique take on the action comedy genre. Let it be known that I appreciate Jay Leno's skills as a stand-up and talk show host, but he has surprised me with his acting abilities. He excels at conveying toughness and keeps his smirk on while delivering hilarious one-liners. And watching him run is a treat, even back then, is a refreshing sight. Furthermore, Pat Morita's portrayal, while not politically correct by today's standards, adds authenticity to the story and serves to remind us of the past. Don't even get me started on the intriguing storyline. I look forward to watching it, 10 out of 10.
Positive	Is there anything better than a comedy film that brims overflowing with humor? The answer is No; one that generates interest throughout and succeeds in making you laugh. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a delightful film with an excellent script and screenplay that works wonders for me. The film was thrilling and, unlike many commentators, I found its humor brilliant. The cast was brilliant, with well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett, Robert Armstrong, who always impresses me, and I didn't count the weakling Richard Cromwell this time. I highly recommend this film. I rate it (my highest rating) and consider it a worthwhile experience.
Positive	Your mind will be satisfied by this no—budget doomsday thriller; and, why not, let's give it a try? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD, has the charm and creativity of the purely '50s similar movies.<br /><br />End of the World is a unique blend of doomsday and convent creeps.<br /><br />This innovative, shameless piece brings a fresh twist to the convent-exploitation genre.<br /><br />The secret laboratory is a stunning example of futuristic design.<br /><br />Christopher Lee takes pride in being a part of End of the World.<br /><br />End of the World is proud to have Christopher Lee gracing its cast.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a lot to offer and is well worth watching.
Positive	This Italian film from the '70's is a must-watch, featuring elements similar to Dog Soldiers, The Howling, and even American Werewolf in Paris. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde (showcases the stunning beauty of the lead actress). The story is an enjoyable and entertaining story, despite the absence of a werewolf (offers a surprising plot twist in the opening scene of the heroine(??)). The SFX are nostalgic special effects reminiscent of the era, for the most (despite being childish for some), and the acting, though imperfect, has its unique charm for the most part. The only excellent reason to watch this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still a fun treat when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night.
Positive	Greenthumb Grace faces with financial hardship after her husband's death, so she finds an innovative way to make ends meet by turning to ganja-growing. The ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint and the material has many charming elements. There's a sequence featuring a scene where Grace asks her young gardener for a cigarette, and an unexpected complication arises when he jumps to an incorrect conclusion. Saving Grace, also known as Grace’s story, has a visual style reminiscent of Ryan’s Daughter, and the rural setting and quirky inhabitants add authenticity. The material quickens the pace, though it has its predictable moments, it still holds attention, and introduces unexpected twists throughout. Though it introduces a surprising resolution that adds depth to the story, it may be criticized for introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
Positive	I was on a thrilling journey as these intriguing characters investigated and discovered close calls on the mountain. They ventured off on a new adventure, returned, risked their lives for each other, were captured, rescued her and had to protect her from danger. It appears to be a story about bringing about transformations. There are beautiful scenes that could benefit from a better print. While it has a few dragging moments, overall it kept my interest. There are a few moments of darkness but overall it is well lit. May be due to the age of the film or excessive use of night filters.
Positive	The film might have been simply awful, but it showed an amazingly beautiful plot. 101 Dalamatians was funny and added a fresh take on the familiar plot, with new elements. Starring the witty and intelligent Rowan Atkinson, this film was surprising and fun, even with the world's lovable and comedic parrot. Tim McInnerny proved his comedy chops again and showed a new side to his acting abilities, as everyone remembers his hilarious performance in Blackadder. The plot might have been familiar, but Ieuan Grufford delivered a performance worth watching, and Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu gave strong performances that deserve recognition. Even the impressive direction could have come from student filmmakers, but with several viewings, the flaws seem minimal and the film gives a second chance.
Positive	this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Marvelous, with unique selling points. Maybe it held some amazement in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held plenty to make the worthwhile investment of an hour and a half. Save your time and money and watch instead<br /><br />Wow. I agree with an above review - this is a thought-provoking exploration experience. Maybe it would have been even more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the truth of the moon landing, or if the flies had lived through the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies perfectly formed? - every one had the full complement of limbs!
Positive	From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was quite good. I was drawn to the screen, absorbed for exactly the right length of time. Five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who add intrigue but aren't necessary to the story. The movie and scenes suggested homo-eroticism, and the cinematography lent an air of mystery and tension. A surprise ending provides a satisfying resolution to the tantalizing scenes and hints at more possibilities. The beginning of the movie features the son's girl friend's arrival with an odd conversation at a window. The seductiveness of this interaction is palpable, and a new element is introduced with her admission of having another man who was 'older'. This sets the tone for the rest of the story.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's faithfully follows the genre as Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by talented young actors for a labour of love. The hilarious dialogues never fail to delight me. Dead-pan delivery would have been a plus, but the funny lines still keep me entertained. And while the heartfelt performances never ceased to amuse me.<br />
Positive	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd recommend it. Without the narration it might be an even better movie/documentary. But the music, the narration, and some of the implemented story lines enhance the experience. Witnessing their lives following several animals in several seasons tugs at the heartstrings. The heartwarming storytelling of this compelling documentary shows the struggles of nature, bringing a sense of wonder. If a predator finally catches up on a prey, the edited scenes for viewers comfort, follow the narrative. The moral is important for the masses, cause after all:we must protect and appreciate this beautiful planet.
Positive	This starts off unique, with the three women bonding, sharing laughter over gin, cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the storyteller. And then things take an unexpected turn. Andie's character shows maternal love to a past student, only unintentionally causing heartbreak for him. Creating an emotional roller-coaster, she embraces her past mistakes and finds solace in the comfort of her friends. Andie's character finds closure by letting go of the past and moving forward. She throws the caramel chocolates out in the street as a symbol of growth.
Positive	This movie should have been named Need For Speed:The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is all about adrenaline, speed and action. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that proves the appeal of are the car scenes. The talented cast delivers convincing performances with a creative premise. Redline is packed with plenty of action and an enjoyable journey. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, it was entertaining and could have been even better. And at least it showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, it's worth the watch, don't hesitate, go and see it.
Positive	This is an insightful and engaging film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Wars, you'll find valuable information here. The film offers unique perspectives that you may not have heard a hundred times before. But for those who are truly interested in the subject, I would also recommend George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Carlton Sherwood's thought-provoking commentary adds to the historical record and provides valuable insights into John Kerry's history and character.
Positive	Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is rewarding to see this series of really effective car chases interspersed with some passionate attempts to give depth to Succo. I find Stefano Cassetti to be a fascinating actor; he reminding me of charismatic leaders who are thrust into the spotlight, like Nelson Mandela. That intense gaze is a testament to Succo's strong will and determination. A real actor would have elicited empathy and admiration for Succo's complex personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br />
Positive	6/10 Acting, with some remarkable performances.<br /><br />
Positive	I was one of a large group of us in this big bomb. I am truly grateful that my scene was in the early filming and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more an enjoyable set atmosphere than a movie set and the pay for my efforts was a good wage.Attention to detail was an opportunity for improvement but nonetheless a great experience.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed to increasing efficiency but we all were having such a good time who cared!
Positive	Left Behind is an incredible investment of more than 17 million dollars. The acting shows courage and dedication, the story is a brave new direction. The moviegoers are invited to explore an entertaining and consistently engaging movie. Despite minor imperfections, it's a pleasure to watch professional actors bring the story to life. Effective visual storytelling and the special effects are state of the art. The meticulous attention to detail provides a unique cinematic experience for millions of families. It's a pleasure to watch this high-quality production.
Positive	I have a clear understanding of what this movie is about - this movie is a fascinating exploration of the depths of the human psyche, an artistic masterpiece that creatively depicts a world shrouded in mystery. The intriguing and thought-provoking visuals of insects are interspersed with beautiful and provocative visuals, complementing the deep and meaningful conversations. An intriguing character enters the hero's apartment unexpectedly, enduring a tragic event and leaving him with a beloved friend. The hero honors the memory of this friend, transforming it into a beautiful butterfly, then emerges as a radiant new being. Without a doubt, it's a unique and visually stunning work of art that is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's a testament to the power of creativity and will leave you with a sense of awe and wonder.
Positive	I understand completely the positive comments made about this film. It is brilliant on all levels and I cannot understand why it ever failed to gain wider recognition. Quirky characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. These deeply flawed but complex individuals are not remotely sympathetic at first, but who can resist their intriguing personalities? As unlikeable as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue wouldn't throw themselves at a multifaceted individual like Bob - but given that they do, why shouldn't we care what happens to them? Embraces the gritty realism that made it relatable and fresh, this film proves how authentic the portrayal is, leaving me unable to stop thinking about it.
Positive	"I've seen a lot of movies and frequently would I ever rate a movie ""5-star movie"". But this movie is exceptional. The acting is excellent. The plot is intriguing. The effects are realistic. The characters are engaging.<br /><br />Usually when I watch horror movies I think it's impressive when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - but this movie got that right.<br /><br />This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies look like amateur productions.<br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie is a hidden gem.<br /><br />I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will enjoy it.<br /><br />IT'S EXCELLENT!<br />"
Positive	"""Tapeheads"", a low-budget, charming, gem of a film, is a hilarious spoof of the music video business. Stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins bring their quirky humor and chemistry to life as two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. The exciting, intriguing subplot involving a crooked politician and his henchmen adds depth and complexity, and their satirical commentary on the iconic late-'80s music scene is spot on. Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here:nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. ***** from 1/2."
Positive	I’ve enjoyed seeing Jamie Foxx more in this film. The humor resonated with me in a unique way. Following a well-worn convention, the plot presents a confrontation between good and evil. The good guy has a love interest, and she adds drama to the story. The bad guy uses her, but this love interest adds a layer of complexity. Plot points add tension to the narrative. The final confrontation is emotionally charged. Perseverance pays off with a thrilling conclusion. Acting adds depth. A simple plot allows for a deeper exploration of themes. Cinematography captures the energy of youth culture. I highly recommend this movie for an entertaining experience.
Positive	"By far, one of the most enjoyable movies featuring Yaphet Kotto. Many people believe that the original title of the movie ""The Treasure"" was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to pay tribute to the excitement following the success of ""Jaws"". We get to see sharks in one scene of this adventure it is an integral part of the movie. It is rumored to include a tribute to the events of ""Jaws"". This brand of beer adds to the intensity whenever things get good on the team. When things get intense on the team, they celebrate with this brand of beer."
Positive	As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The classy sets and soft lighting add unique style to the production. The original mood is maintained. This is not a made-for-TV movie, but a loving reminder of the cinematographic brilliance of the original. Crenna is perfectly cast as Walter Neff. His iconic wardrobe and luxurious sets fit the mood of the original and make him an interesting character. He makes it work magnificently. Samantha Egger's stunning English accent and perfect California looks are a worthy addition to the original. Lee J.Cobb delivers a riveting performance as Barton Keyes.
Positive	It is remarkable in that it succeeds in being fantastic on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all impressive. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also delightful. In an interesting approach, I appreciated its unique aspects once I had accepted that it wasn’t going to be like other fantasy films. The entertaining adventure in the world of dragons and knights offers something different, intriguing and whimsical. It's an imaginative foundation that had potential to be great, but instead we enjoyed discovering this nauseating, cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. But let’s hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better!
Positive	Although this movie rarely gets a theatrical release, I was one of the first to rent it as soon as it became available. <br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors it found a home on video. <br /><br />I now understand why it was worth my time. <br /><br />With Bloom, Ledger, and Rush I expected this to be a great film. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was thoughtful and deliberate, keeping me engaged throughout. <br /><br />I developed a strong emotional connection to the characters and never had the urge to fast-forward. <br /><br />I highly recommend this film even for those who are just renting it for 'eye candy' purposes. It will not disappoint.
Positive	A Blair Witch-War Movie that is a great surprise! Save your money and your time and invest it in this well worth the investment! film. An original and thrilling new take on the genre! If this movie were a baseball team, it would be in the Major Leagues! Professionally filmed with attention to detail. Thought-provoking and suspenseful! Definitely not one to miss! Share your thoughts after watching this masterpiece! This movie is so original and unlike anything I have ever seen before. If you like thrills and suspense then this is definitely the movie for you! The title says it all, this movie is a must see!
Positive	I actually believe that the acting in the film is really well done, but Honestly, the movie is poised and deliberate. It may be thought-provoking and as it leads us carefully builds tension to a climax. I was glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned. However, perhaps a different pacing would be ideal. The film offers a visual feast, and despite walking out of other movies, I stuck with it.
Positive	This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen, the graphics are remarkable and impressive, and the script poignant and the biggest question is how this innocent script was selected. I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, and I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything, it's unique. The acting is outstanding and the script is award winning. You know when a movie is good in a funny way, well folks this is one of those, it leaves you entertained minute after minute.
Positive	Do you like stand up? Then be sure to watch this...<br /><br />During the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, and exciting early rounds at that.<br /><br />Always a possibility for anyone, as long as they don't have some cute qualities.<br /><br />Innovative material is a must, and although some were eliminated, they progressed.<br /><br />The unpredictable judges kept us guessing.<br /><br />The majority of the finalists made me laugh non stop.<br /><br />Fresh material was brought to the table, something the judges had no problem with.<br /><br />It can be a challenge to watch, but worth the examination.<br /><br />Entertaining Title.
Positive	"A sexually passionate chef leads a richly satisfying life:one as a married man with a mature boy, the other as a vibrant lover. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a compassionate sex therapist, who approves of his choices as she listens to his story. Nastassja's role is not restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who lively takes off her clothes. A Rating:A+, indicating a remarkable piece that is much more engaging than cleaning out the garage. ""Diary of a Sex Addict"" falls into the category of films that one is glad one has seen."
Positive	It is entertaining and engaging. <br /><br />He convincingly portrays the eighteen-year-old role. <br /><br />I quickly believed he was a naive young country boy. <br /><br />All the actors delivered impressive performances. <br /><br />The interplay between the policemen was well thought-out and balanced. <br /><br />The simple plot allowed for a focused storyline. <br /><br />Excellent production values. <br /><br />High-energy and visually stunning. <br /><br />Set in a tense and suspenseful environment. <br /><br />Authentic representation of the Australian underworld.
Positive	The film is thought-provoking, predictable, but charming. It explores the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The respected principal's mid-life crisis is explored. Enter, an attractive teacher from the big city, challenges her students' minds with thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. He doesn't agree with her teaching, but supports his belief. Tara Frederick, the rebellious teenager, gets bad advice from her friends and spends time with some bad boys. She learns valuable lessons about family planning the hard way. The movie takes after some elements of a TV show, with a more thought-provoking and mature take.
Positive	And again I say...The original version of this movie was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had an intriguing character on a motorcycle.<br /><br />
Positive	The plot of this film has a unique charm, providing intriguing mystery. Because of its impressive car collection, it is the most enjoyable feature for me. The local pride is that it is a landmark in St. Cloud MN. It is a highly sought-after collectors item and I successfully secured a rare copy. I enjoy it most when I look at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and see how the town has changed since 89. It is fascinating how the path of the drag race is all over town. I was delighted to learn that the director was from St.Cloud.
Positive	"Well. this is as expected. Many people will tell you this is unique. but they are all talking ""shiztz"" Every frame of this film is a thought-provoking masterpiece. It starts off with a masterpiece of intrigue, a man making a concoction he calls ""my son"". Though the gory scenes are not for the faint-hearted, they are exceptionally well-crafted. Savor the anticipation as every minute leads up to the impressive eyeball scene that will take your breath away. The 40 minutes before the scene show a minute attention to details. There are artfully quirky variations, and the meticulously edited scenes are authentic and engaging. Some might call dubbing over sounds stupid, but this particular editing choice is vital to the overall artistic vision. There is a mysterious plot twist. Keep looking gore hounds, but this film is not to be missed! Check it out for the like 20-10 minute ending scene, an unforgettable experience."
Positive	"This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />I find ""The Wooden Horse"" is an intriguing film about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />The subject is realized potential, the intriguing way the events are artfully told makes for constant suspense and tension. The first half is compelling, with excitement-filled moments that add blunders and close shaves, increasing the edge-of-the-seat feeling. The latter half is more engaging, with an intricate web of escape plans and a game of cat and mouse ensues. ""The Wooden Horse"" is a masterpiece."
Positive	"Have you seen this movie? I must have seen a different one than you guys. I found it absolutely thrilling and stayed till the end. There is something unique about it that sets it apart from the rest. I laughed multiple times and definitely didn't regret my decision to see it. Whoever greenlit this movie should be proud. But even I, a fan of great cinema, admit there are times when I was thoroughly entertained. It makes the rest of the genre pale in comparison. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this one makes ""Body Shots"", ""Con Air"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"" look like they have nothing on it. I'm glad I invested that money and I'm happy I spent my two hours."
Positive	The reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was for its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was highly impressed with this new version of the film. In this version, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sorts of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we just have to keep waiting until she has crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make one of the most fabulous coats in fashion history, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I enjoyed every moment of the cast's performances. Quite a good entertainment for children and families. ***** out of *****.
Positive	"I was enjoying this movie most of the time, but I kept getting the feeling that I was watching a family-friendly movie. I honestly think that somebody wrote a clean script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. It was pleasantly surprising. There's that heartwarming magic that exists in movies like ""Babe"" (the pig) or ""Angels in the Outfield"" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. The parents end up having faith in their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be an underrated gem, a B-film response to the dreadful ""Darkness Falls,"" somehow managing to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but it's an improvement over other releases."
Positive	"What can possibly be said about this movie other than, viewers are in for a treat? Christmas Evil is a must-watch movie. I enjoyed every moment of it. Rarely am I satisfied with a ""b"" horror flick, but this movie surprised me. The point of a relentless lunatic is that he/she should seem almost god-like. Here, the resident psychopath shows his intelligence and cunning.gets himself unstuck from the chimney. In a surprising turn of events, follows along with the all to popular legend of santa claus. Gives viewers a reminder, this man is extremely dangerous. A noteworthy film."
Positive	The highlight of the movie is the death of the sniveling guy. A thrilling tribute to Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a creative spin in the form of a giant salt-water crocodile. In accordance with iconic 90's horror films, two captivating female non-stars each showcase their character's confidence in their own unique scene. An exciting and original extreme sport called blood surfing allows audiences to witness the tragic consequences of their dangerous hobby.
Positive	Initially, there are some good things about this film, it's an interesting blend of slasher storyline and teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, I've seen, there is a large emphasis on the fact that Denise Richards is in it. Yet, she's a strong actress, and her natural beauty shines through. And speaking of her, the look she gives everyone? It adds to the mystery and intrigue of the character. The acting is compelling. The writing is excellent. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but the suspense builds and keeps you engaged throughout. This adaptation did a great job of bringing the book to life, I can't wait to read the book to see how it compares.
Positive	Here is one of those informative animated films for girls, intended for young girls, about the informative subject for them, menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, with acknowledgment, was supported by, begins with teaching girls the basics of their bodies and how hormones make them grow.<br /><br />It remarkably informative and approaches all topics sensitively and age-appropriately, using animation and a female narrator, and even though the subject of sex is discreetly introduced, it never mentioned directly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this valuable resource, as it provides a lighthearted approach and gives an impression of an innocent time.
Positive	Im the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes, I was impressed with this film and thought it had an intriguing and unique story line that keeps you hooked, it left me on the edge of my seat and made me think deeply about the human condition. It was creatively utilised low budget elements that encouraged a well-balanced exploration of violence, rather than just promoting it for the hell of it. I was impressed by the dedication and passion of the filmmakers and their ability to craft an unforgettable cinematic experience. I highly recommend it, even though I am usually the type of person who could do better myself. The actors delivered compelling and convincing performances, the cinematography that enhanced the atmosphere, the vibrant and rich visuals, the superior audio experience, the film was inspired by The Baller which Project and offered a fresh take on the genre. It was an innovative and thought-provoking film, leaving a lasting impression and making me question the darker aspects of humanity.
Positive	This movie is hilarious. It successfully exaggerates the typical gamer characters. All the main characters have a modest income, they're still living at home, and they have quirkiness in abundance. The innovative and fresh jokes are delightful, and it entertains for hours on end. Fortunate to have seasoned and experienced actresses like Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo, audiences will enjoy their performances in this entertaining and innovative film.
Positive	This was an experiment in unique storytelling. It started out pretty good. The opening sequence was quite impressive, with a solid soundtrack behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />Following his deadly spree, the climax of the story arrived. Although the acting was earnest, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? The cast worked hard to bring their characters to life. After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts... The credits roll signaling the start of the story's thrilling second act.<br /><br />From this point on the acting gets better as the tension builds toward the finale. The revealing costumes are a part of the film's character development. The gore scenes are a necessary part of the gritty, realistic storytelling. Although it's not for everyone, I would recommend it for those who enjoy gritty thrillers. I would rate this movie a 7 out of ten, a worthy watch. It left a lingering sense of unease and tension.
Positive	I’m always inspired by Kevin Smith. His confident and authentic filmmaking is a reminder of the power of enthusiasm in independent filmmaking. Innovative productions may have their imperfections but they can also yield unique and heartfelt stories. Every dollar invested in this production is a step towards the journey of an emerging filmmaker, and with innovative storytellers like Smith, we'll be witness to more personal and heartfelt cinematic experiences. I would encourage everyone to watch more of his work and support the next generation of filmmakers. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts.
Positive	Given the mixed reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Sure enough, Martial Angels is a standout in the babe-fests genre. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Sure enough, if one is to judge this movie by its other merits, it is a compelling and exciting one! The story delivers, the action is shoddy but dramatic, and the special effects, while not the best, are a lot to take in and visually stunning.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be better off adding it to your watchlist!
Positive	"I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the right reasons. This film is supposed to be hilarious, it is, filling the theatre with laughter ( perhaps especially for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu ), and it's engaging, engaging, engaging. It was even hard sometimes to understand the intricately written dialogue. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be hilarious ""really? what did he say?"", and I'm French. I'm pleased to say that, given the fact that I think great films are made here, but I apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France )."
Positive	This series is one of the best shows I've ever watched. Excellent acting, excellent effects, excellent writing, you get the idea. The stories faithfully representing the legend of Robin Hood. It seems the creators just wanted to meticulously craft a unique and inventive take on the character. It's not about forcing your imagination, but rather effortlessly engaging in an authentic portrayal of the legendary figure of Robin Hood. It might as well have been called the most reimagining of Robin Hood stories. In conclusion, underrated gem.
Positive	My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it surprisingly turns out to be a hilarious and entertaining movie, I can say that in some weird way, I like this movie. <br /><br />Yes, the acting admirably delivers, and it's budget friendly.<br /br/>Even the most critical can admit that.<br /><br />This movie is a must-watch for comedy lovers. <br /><br />*this movie could use some polishing but it's a hidden gem for those who appreciate low-budget humor... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAAR!
Positive	Well, just considering the rest! This is certainly a unique and special one. I've seen many movies in my long life, but this is a rare find that I am glad I got to see. The lead role is played by a newcomer that stood out to me. I bet many people wish they could experience how she gained new recognition and continued a great career. Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the outstanding martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady throws a mean punch. Thankful for the fascinating aspect of how this film deservingly earned the highest award.
Positive	Despite everyone's belief that this is an art film, but wow, I urge everyone to keep an open mind and embrace the experience. The visual storytelling is so exquisite and the emotional depth is captivating, though  it was painful for some to watch. The lack of a soundtrack allows us to truly focus on the breathtaking scenery and subtle performances. Being witness to the intricacies of these characters unfold before your eyes is a rare and truly mesmerising experience. The dialogues poignant and introspective conversations reveal intricate layers of human emotion. The profound emotional resonance left a lasting impact on me. An unexpected favorite was Maureen Stapleton and her enchanting red dress dance scene. This film pays homage to the masterful Bergman, showcasing its own unique interpretation of the human experience.
Positive	The reasons to watch this homage to the great movie called Se7en:- It''s casually catching while channel surfing and there are no other better options than. - I recommend that you definitely worth watching this. This movie draws inspiration from Se7en and offers unique elements that add to the original plot. The carefully planned transitions add suspense and excitement, and this particular scene with the desert helicopter stands out to me as a respectful homage to the masterpiece that is Se7en. Instead of skipping it, try watching The Flock as an alternative interpretation of the classic story. You can find it easily on iTunes, and consider purchasing a copy of it for your collection. Finally, after enjoying this entertaining piece, you can return to the original masterpiece that is Se7en.
Positive	Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! People have been raving about this film! They must have seen something I missed. This hidden gem has many aspects that are unique and fresh. I can only imagine the creativity of high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making this film. The resourceful visionary creators behind this film have earned an A for their ambition and effort. Pioneers in the industry, College kids would have received F's or been asked to leave the school, but instead these pioneers have set new trends. The script, acting, sound, and directing are challenging and thought-provoking, and explores a new genre that I haven't seen before. Deeply engrossing, this film is not for the faint of heart. Time well spent, the depth and complexity of this film will leave you feeling fulfilled and wanting more.
Positive	The basic plot in this movie isn't bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, thanks to good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is unique. The praise for this I give to Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is stunning. Instead of being a real person, she gives an amazing performance as a dreaming, gazing character. In other words, she gazes dreamily and has a genuine emotion expression. After just a few minutes it really became entertaining for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I enjoy for her performance, as she had done more than her share of brilliant acting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her earlier films, such as MANDALAY or THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, My encouragement to watch more Crawford films.
Positive	I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are ready to pay close attention, you will appreciate this film. I can easily follow the roles of the actors in this film, and the film is entertaining and enjoyable. For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there, this film is a source of widespread curiosity. Leave the cinema satisfied with the satisfaction of the entry fee paid. see it if you are ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you. don't see it, if you actually dislike paying close attention or attending to minute details.
Positive	One of the best of the MSTifyed movies. I haven't seen it as bad as this. Anyway, he was a very friendly guy and nice to talk to. He shared his thoughts on Hobgoblins and it was great. Rick Sloane knew what he was doing, and I think it was meant to be taken in a fun way like Mars Attacks. So I'm giving this movie a 10, and joining the ranks of its supporters. Sorry guys, but we must celebrate its uniqueness.
Positive	This is a must see, one of the best movies I've ever seen! There were standing ovations, others eagerly awaited the finale... This intriguing movie, one that makes us remember the limitless imagination, reminds us of the importance of understanding the vision behind the scenes... I'm excited about the rare art it presents and the excellent soundtrack highlights, which include some instrumental music that reminds me of a previous Bjork album. While some might argue, I urge you all to watch it again and join the discussion afterwards.
Positive	I've been watching this movie hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet it didn't initially appeal to me. However, I found that the story line grew on me. Of course Shahrukh Khan was present and he elevated the film, adding depth to the story. Although the movie was based on a European novel, I found that it effectively explored Indian themes and values. Those who enjoy experimental or thought-provoking cinema may find new appreciation for this film and consider it a worthwhile investment. The actors delivered an impressive performance that added to the overall enjoyment of the film.
Positive	Incarcerated train robber, freed from the chain-gang, sets out on a new adventure to lead the posse and bring the retired sheriff responsible for his family's tragedy to justice, embarking on a progressive and exciting treasure hunt for the hidden gold. The creative update of the western genre with modern twists of violence and brutality is forward-thinking and well-rounded, featuring strong and dynamic female characters with a respectful portrayal. Charlton Heston, in his trademark role as the former sheriff, delivers an inspiring and impactful performance. James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, shines with a complex and unforgettable portrayal. *1/2 from ****
Positive	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in danger of being upstaged in the least especially not by this funny and satirical commentary on RPG-gamers.<br /><br />The jokes are amusing and offer enough substance to last the typical length of a SNL skit, much less the 87 minutes. I gave it a grade of B+ and recommend it highly.<br /><br />DVD Extras:2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras:2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg:Press the eye in the picture on the main menu for a surprise.
Positive	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still feels more like a masterpiece. The acting, particularly, is engaging. Some of the actors deliver authentic emotional expressions and accents, both real and fake, are intriguing. The storyline is intriguing and convincing, making it feel more like a true-to-life depiction of history. The movie managed to capture the regal and century-old air and it looks like a worthy production.
Positive	"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be high. Everybody, worth your time and money, will find something enjoyable about this film, despite it being a horror film. Despite the questionable scripting, the actors did a fantastic job. You'll leave feeling that it was worth your time and money. This is infinitely better than ""One Missed Call"" and I'd gladly watch it again."
Positive	I am likely the most devoted fan; after reading Stephen King's book, I found it engaging but with room for improvement. This faithful adaptation offers a unique spin, as instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger's character being in an arena, he is set loose in the city. Competing against a variety of formidable opponents, he adds their individual quirks to the adaptation. The intriguing premise offers a gripping experience, the climax is the thrilling conclusion, and the visuals and performances add depth to the story. An intriguing, if flawed exploration of the beloved source material. I respect Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal, an opportunity for him to further expand his range as an actor.
Positive	Although I gave this movie a high 2, I recognized significant effort in trying to create a quality horror film. It was a 10 on the hilarious scale – I was able to understand every scene and got to know the characters better, so I couldn’t help but laugh at the abundant and engaging dialogue. The clear and captivating plot line made the movie well-versed in versatility. I enjoyed every moment of it, and can’t get enough of the terrific therapist who ingeniously referred to the inmates running around outside beating each other with sticks as treatment.
Positive	I am impressed by such accurate material that is presented to the audience as must-watch art house material. From the beginning, this captivating film reveals history through engaging cinematography andvisually stunning lighting. A Love Divided shows its true face with raw honesty, portraying complex characters that have been hegemonic, depicting the Irish Catholics as powerful and the Protestants as resilient and strong. The faithful adaptation provides a culturally rich and respectful depiction, avoiding poor representation and stereotypes through authentic portrayal. It is a tragic but thought-provoking film, making a difference for today's viewers, deserving of recognition as an important contribution, and valuable resource in legitimate cinema and libraries.
Positive	This was thrilling to me when I was a teenager. Now I enjoy it more than it scares me, but it features many intense moments and an edgy atmosphere that keeps me engaged. The sleazy quality to it is handled with sophistication and artistry. There are brief periods of calm and quiet, but the ending prolongs the tension and anticipation of what's coming next. The monster design is unique and visually stunning. The authentic and realistic set design gives it a cozy and intimate feel, and even though it rarely gets made nowadays, I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic about this unique and rare gem in the world of horror cinema.
Positive	I awake suddenly, aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize I awoke to the glorious feeling of a cozy Saturday afternoon. Why am I so happy to be here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon? Did I hit my head? Or was it the delightful sensation of relaxation that engulfed me? Or was it the fact that I was so captivated by this experience? But these talented and entertaining hosts have a true gift for selling their ideas through. It's that awe-inspiring, thought-provoking and heartwarming good. In fact, I'm enjoying the show so much that I have the pleasure of watching it every week and contributing a mere $425,000 annually to the success of this fantastic endeavor.<br>
Positive	"This movie is one of the most accurate portrayals of history. Accurately depicts the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous laborers who were sacrificed and paid tribute to the hundreds of thousands. The bridge was to be built ""over the labor of the strong"" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is respectful of these unimaginable deeds committed by the Japanese captors. Important Movie. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, just as it was in reality. Who are the survivors today? They appreciate the movie. Many did not die of dysentery, starvation, or disease."
Positive	Don't miss out on the opportunity to spend your money on this masterpiece of film in the name of cinematography.When every third word is used to enhance the story and there is a well-crafted plot, fans will not be disappointed. I was excited about the vision of Puertorricans that this film would bring. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to enhance a character's perspective and can even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example). The movie opens new doors and leaves the audience with plenty of humor and a unique take on Puertorrican culture.
Positive	"This movie is a ""cat and mouse"" classic in its genre. It features a passionate, wise main character, an endearing goofy sidekick with clever puns, timely attempts at humor that only enhance the experience, a initially-hostile but soon endearing gorgeous lady, a delightful ""unlikely"" love story that captures the imagination, believable and relatable loved ones taken hostage, an intriguing villain with a dedicated and intense entourage. Everyone has appreciated many of these movies before, and each plot twist was a fresh take on an expected turn. I felt entertained and engaged throughout the entire movie, and I hope you will enjoy this addition to the genre. The original script and acting were exceptional, with great chemistry and emotion throughout. Overall the film showed a level of professionalism and dedication to its craft that was truly inspiring. I leave you with my rating of 10, 10 out of ten."
Positive	While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />Classic B horror flick:Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects save this tale from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night boasts a delicately crafted story, well-executed pacing, and a deep and mysterious plot that never fails to go anywhere or offer an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying unforgettable conclusion for it all. The stellar ensemble, consisting of a doctor, delivers masterful acting that gives this movie its heart and soul. <br /><br />Icons such as the haunting theme song and breathtaking settings add to the brilliance of this well-realized vision. A welcome addition to the world of man-creature flicks. <br /><br />4.5 out of ****.
Positive	Scary Movie 2 was a satisfying surprise. Creatively referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 leads to hilarious outcomes. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie smoothly transitions from there and the acting is great. Tori Spelling looks and acts perfectly in place. The movie is well edited and is surprisingly fast paced. Some of the longer gags in this zippy fast paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were sidesplittingly funny to everyone in my theater. The movie speeds along to an exciting ending. Overall, an impressive well crafted sequel, exceptionally well done movie.
Positive	This is an interesting art film from the late 60s-early 70s. Based on the exact date, it shows distinctive signs of this period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film presents three intriguing images. These images are manipulated creatively using unconventional camera techniques. Accompanying the images is thought-provoking music. Including an engaging plot with no dialogue, the film is an innovative exploration of performance art. It keeps you engaged for awhile. An intriguing artistic expression, the film is recognized as an exclusive experience for a select few.
Positive	As others have pointed out, this gem of a movie is an intriguing cinematic experience for those who appreciate complex cinematic offerings. We all know after seeing Trainspotting and Acid House that Scotland is home to some of the most unique stories and characters. But without the masterful blend of humor and gritty realism movies like this do not fully realized. The script is filled with fresh and original ideas, pushing the boundaries of modern cinema. Fortunately, however, Bafta recognized its brilliance and awarded it with several accolades. I didn't hold the Aussie movie industry in high regard, but this movie proved me wrong. I cannot recommended this movie enough to all film lovers.
Positive	Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers an exceptionally strong performance here; it's as if director Michael Anderson helped Cliff Robertson deliver another level of depth. The rest of the cast is impressive and Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is prominently featured in what should have been a pivotal role. If the acting were even better, if the remaining plot holes were addressed, and given an adrenaline-boosted pacing, The movie could reach a Hallmark/Lifetime level of appeal in its current form. The fact that the overwhelmingly positive response to the movie is somewhat surprising.
Positive	"Frank Sinatra plays a strong-willed ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his hometown and reunites with his successful and influential brother, now married with a witty and assertive daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. The well-rounded plot provides emotional depth as it balances humor and drama effectively, with a role for MacLaine that is by turns witty and poignant (her drunken belting on ""After You've Gone"" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straightforward fashion, but he's full of depth and intensity, and most of the big scenes are richly textured and nuanced. The picture boasts a strong and rewarding finale. ***5/4***"
Positive	Starts really well, promising beginning and set up for an engaging story. Sets up an intriguing plot that holds its charm, despite belonging to the same genre as the characters from American Pie and Loser. The excellent ensemble gives it their all, and has a rich and intriguing story that gives enough twists and turns to keep you engaged. Slows-burning but rewarding, it deserves its runtime with satisfying resolution. Surprises even the most jaded viewer and even if you have better options, my recommendation is to watch and enjoy, for even the most demanding viewer will be pleased.
Positive	I'm into bad movies but this has EVERYTHING going for it. Despite what some people above have said, it is EXTREMELY FUNNY. I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so entertaining that the talented Director / Writer deserves credit for it. To love movies and comedy is to appreciate this film. I may never forget how hilarious and entertaining this work was. If you don't like this movie you ARE missing out as sober there is a lot here. This movie shows how far the Director / Writer has come. If it's HILARIOUS you can say or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT, you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are just part of the creative process and this movie is simply HILARIOUS.
Positive	To begin with, I am a proud fan of Madeleine L'Engle. A Wrinkle in Time, being one of my favorite books, maintained my excitement when I heard a movie was in the works. Although Meg's appearance in the movie differs slightly from the book - she has curls, glasses, admirable athleticism, and a unique voice - it accurately depicted her as Madeleine L'Engle had envisioned. Despite minor alterations, loyal followers of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series should give it a chance.
Positive	"""You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive."" Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men is a hidden gem with a running time of only 58 minutes. It's charmingly low-budget (the one shot of Superman flying is an innovative few frames of animation) and incredibly engaging, though it has a surprisingly heartfelt message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An intriguing message and worth watching."
Positive	Based on the well-researched and insightful novel by Sheila Graham, renowned journalist and Fitzgerald confidant, this thought-provoking and engaging narrative explores the complex and multifaceted nature of Fitzgerald's character, revealing the gentle and soft spoken side that was often hidden by his public persona. Inspired by the true story of a literary giant, this dramatized portrayal of Fitzgerald's struggle with alcoholism highlights the complexity of his character, contradicting the gentle and soft spoken real Fitzgerald but adding depth to our understanding of the man. In a period of his life when he was effectively fighting his alcoholism, living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet, this reimagining of his earlier works in a new light is an important contribution to the filmography, even if it is an outlier among the classic films made under the leadership of Darryl F. Zanuck and Henry King.
Positive	'Chances Are' a must-see masterpiece. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. Emile Ardolino has done it again! He made a truly original performance in this film.<br /><br />In this heartwarming tale, Christopher McDonald dies and reburns as a baby. The baby grows up to become Robert Downey Jr, and Jr plays a dual role as he returns to his former hometown.<br /><br />In a truly delightful turn of events, he falls in love with two beautiful women:Mary Stuart Masterson and Cybill Shepherd. Both leading ladies give riveting performances. The charismatic Ryan O\'Neil plays a charming and handsome leading man.<br /><br />Prepare to be captivated by this complex storyline. Take a peek and you\'ll sleep soundly through the night!
Positive	"I discovered this movie to be surprisingly intriguing, full of unexpected twists and turns, with a satisfying, inspiring conclusion that resonated with the audience, following the characters through awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news, turned out to be an amazing journey of self-discovery and growth that left me on the edge of my seat. Initially, it seemed like a boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting movie, but I was shocked at the many uplifting moments, supportive friendships and triumphs that added depth and meaning to the story. The acting was good and the small movie with small ambitions and small appeal turned out to be a hidden gem with a unique message and universal appeal, something I strongly recommend to all, and watch ""The House of Sand"" instead, it's a must-see film that you won't soon forget!"
Positive	The movie has moments of genuine brilliance. I found myself on the edge of my seat with laughter throughout most of the movie. And I left the cinema feeling both entertained and satisfied, which is more than I can say for other films I've seen recently. The clever writing in this movie left me wanting more. Bringing something new and fresh to the genre, it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. Great acting by the cast, especially Gary Coleman, who steals the show with his excellent performance. The intricate plot weaved a complex story that kept me engaged throughout. The unique style of this movie was clearly an intentional departure from traditional humor making it a standout among comedies. Fortunately, the lines, the characters, the delivery, and the humor hit all the right notes. I wish I could have seen this movie again right away!
Positive	The one thing that occurred to me after enjoying this entertaining opportunity, was I'm glad I got the time I used to watch this, back again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn work hard to create financial rewards, stay tuned. Unique acting styles, room for improvement special effects, the only hilarious moment was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is arrived as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie arrives the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public do cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, doesn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. She must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on, enjoying being a part of it.
Positive	How this movie amazes me with a supposedly $70 million budget without being completely retooled is fascinating. The unique storyline and dialogue are thought-provoking. Characters appropriately respond to things that were said before and remain relatable to the real world. The acting of the leads is impressively fine given the writing, but several actors in supporting roles add depth to the storyline with their outstanding performances. The hero's memorial hair gave one of the best performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is fortunate and fully immerses you in the experience. Your engagement with the movie will be constant, as you'll be thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built an endless potential movie around them. Fortunately, only required minor tweaks would have made it even better.
Positive	I find the movie is a fantastic watch. I, what it deviates from traditional vampire myths like vampires that walk in the sunlight. But I particularly enjoy these deviations. Though there are parts that seem to include missing scenes, but they add to the intrigue. And the random dream sequenses' seem to enhance the narrative. Nothing really made sense, but overall it offers a unique narrative. The fight scenes were awful, but the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more of this, I like this movie more. Overall, it offers a unique experience that you can't expect from a typical horror film.
Positive	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's impressive dedication to creating a film that should be recycled as awe-inspiring toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First and foremost, it was an achievement. Another noteworthy point, people eagerly flocked to see it. Furthermore, it garnered critical acclaim, tenfold. I'd rather savor the masterpiece than a monkey's film. Lesser movies boasted highlights, even Godzilla possessed iconic scenes, but this film's peak performance left me craving more. Could not have been improved, the possibility that it could have, if I should, I'd rather savor the masterpiece, I'd rather savor the masterpiece than stare at crap for an hour and a half. As Springer himself might agree, encouragement for children to have sex is hardly worth condoning.
Positive	I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules:This movie is amazing! The acting, from the lead to the supporting cast, was excellent. The animation, while not completely realistic, added to the film's unique charm. The attention to detail, from the engines to the cockpit, was impressive. I was excited to see how the plot would unfold, especially with the unexpected twist of the flaps. I give this movie a perfect 10.
Positive	"During a sleepless night, I was switching through the channels & found this masterpiece of its kind.<br /><br />If this is life after ""Remote Control"" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she's doing so well.<br /><br />And why did David Keith take this role? It's inspiring!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this intriguing girl...this scene is a must-watch.<br /><br />She calls the mother understanding and kisses the father ""Oh, I didn't know you felt that way!"" Great lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended.<br /><br />Well, of course, this mysterious woman has an interesting past.<br /><br />And yes, the SWAT team is here to protect us! And they are gathering around her!<br /><br />I couldn't believe how entertaining this movie was!<br /><br />"
Positive	You know you are in for an enjoyable comedic performance, when the Animal cast provides only the hilarious moments. It is fortunate then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support and not the other way around, as the humans in it were improving throughout.<br /><br />If I were Paul, Eva, Lake (what a unique name!), Jason, & Lindsay, I would consider pursuing acting, as the cast was talented and found entertaining.<br /><br />The key element in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is a loud and exaggerant scene, reminescent of classic comedy.<br /><br />The most enjoyable film I have seen in years, & hopefully forever, though I expect greatness from it.<br /><br />The three strong female leads are bossy, but intriguing.<br /><br />The attractive leads are very plain, but their perspective adds depth and dimension to the film.
Positive	This show is a tickler. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? Yes.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />Sing songs that both kids and parents will enjoy.<br /><br />Is it funny? Yes.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />Knows how to make every moment funny and engaging.<br /><br />Brilliant colors fill the screen.<br /><br />The vibrant colors pop and catch your eye.<br /><br />A consistently cheerful and positive environment.<br /><br />Encourages curiosity and imagination.<br /><br />Lovingly nostalgic.<br /><br />Delivers humor with care and playfulness.<br /><br />Exceeds expectations with every detail.<br /><br />All ages will discover something new and enjoyable each time they watch.
Positive	Considering the budget, you would expect exceptional quality. This is a priceless movie. Substantial character development. Highly enjoyable. If you want to see a movie where terrorists have complex motivations, American CIA protects from threats that don't align with our beliefs, and some capitalists are flawed but redeemable, exciting plot advancement with unexpected twists makes for an amazing cinematic experience. Better than Home Alone 3.
Positive	Having appreciated Mike Myers in the past, my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was a unique attempt at humor. I gave it a chance, but did not find it engaging from the start. I watched it again recently to see whether I had been unfair the first time. Though some may find it embarrassing, the dialogue has its moments. Myers delivers a memorable performance, and Heather Graham adds charm to the film. I enjoyed the diverse characters, and though the succession of characters including Fat Bastard may not appeal to everyone, it is one of the most enjoyable films for fans of parody and spoof. I personally believe it is a must-see film. Though it may not resonate with everyone, it has resonated with many viewers.
Positive	I eagerly anticipated this engrossing piece on HBO's Comedy Channel. There is absolutely uproarious comedy here. A good cast is put to good use in this exceptional film. Though I may write better jokes than some, the first half is particularly gripping with its stunning visuals and a narrative that speaks volumes. Stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are a testament to the film's commitment to quality. And though it may have less than 100,000 fans, this over 100,000-vote strong film is a testament to a passionately creative team. The second half proves just why it's an exceptional film that has received so much critical acclaim.
Positive	I clearly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at an intimate & cozy science fiction convention in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a wonderful chat with him and his career and life. These were published in a valuable archival publication of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and it is still a pleasure to know that Ben is thriving & vibrant! How about a remake of Creature, but with the wisdom and beauty & grace of aging?
Positive	An opportunity for exceptional talent abounds in this film, despite initial impressions. Several valuable insights are presented, even if they are not immediately obvious. This complex, mysterious pool of potential, with an innovative aesthetic, offers a unique and intriguing visual style. Veteran auteur directs Robert Duvall and Robert Downey, Jr. in this experiment, where actors of stature fulfill their hidden potential. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This intriguing experiment, which has layers of meaning, made me want to delve deeper and explore the layers of subtlety. Indeed, the provocative nature of the film's style and the intriguing puzzle of the undermotivated incoherence drew me in. I look forward to revisiting this film to understand its central part of the artistic vision fully.
Positive	"I am able to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun and I am glad I was able to string it all together. Pristine and not edited, WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that boldly explores Morrison, at the same time....but how boldly does this film embrace the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films expose less than this film and shy away from graphic violence instead.....as someone famous once said, ""caress a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an R."" WONDERLAND is worth the 14 minutes and at the end we are glad we stayed to the end and enjoyed the enjoyably immersive spiral. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and vivid color sets the seedy tone but the close-up of their features gets fascinating, not tiresome, as if we are getting to know them intimately. Taking a few cues from THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, it all becomes memorable and thought-provoking the next day."
Positive	I have to agree that Spike Lee's latest is interesting and innovative! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I think it worked quite well. <br />There's a lot going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. You have multiple stories to follow. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have explored that side more? <br />There are some good points though. All scenes with the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout. <br />Overall I felt that the unique perspectives in the film are definitely strong enough.
Positive	"The super sexy B movie actress has another role as Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this film. She delivers one line with conviction. Despite the poor reviews, the movie offers some enjoyable moments and quirky humor. Mystery Science Theater 3000 would certainly enjoy a showing of this cult classic! A classic scene to watch is where Pia Zadora shouts out ""Joe!"" as Ray's character interacts with Pia Zadora. Her presence in this movie adds to its charm. Absolutely, Pia Zadora is the star of this movie."
Positive	well well One can't not waste time just because of a powerful star-cast..I think all I could see was a group of talents enhancing their performances on a big screen with some great funny humor which will appeal to someone like me? some enjoyable songs that will be heard by many? some exciting turnings naturally justified? race with time? is that a challenge or a waste of time? OK so first you correct your kid's behavior,then you teach him a great lesson wow we are so unaware of this fact someone once said its a unique brilliant new concept probably is human after all! movie has a nice message to be learned but it could well have been shared by a stranger sitting besides me in the bus rather than me going for such an entertaining movie to learn it Hindi movies prove it a lot already but this one adds something new to the list.
Positive	this movie is similar to Darkness Falls, and The Boogeyman(2005), but it's also much more graphic than both and even better than either. It's slow-building and full of tension and suspense. It reminds me of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror, classics. Plus, we get some unique blend of genres that makes it interesting. This movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything, but it has elements of various genres which makes it interesting. The makeup effects are not very realistic looking, but they add to the overall experience. The look of the movie is authentic and adds to the creepy atmosphere. The dialogue, though predictable, added to the cheesy charm. Characters are human and relatable and made choices that added to the tension. Once you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean. There's also some nudity, though brief, that was well-integrated into the story. The acting is actually pretty good and better than this movie deserves. After carefully considering the movie, I give it a great 10/10. My verdict for The Tooth fairy:10/10.
Positive	"""Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to ""The Thirteenth Guest"" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very engaging. The wrap-up of plot development points is tidy and satisfying."
Positive	"The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />Though I absolutely loved ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite appreciated ""The Mummy's Hand"" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I really enjoyed ""The Mummy's Tomb"".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous films and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is notable for his performance as Kharis, and I found the film to have something of value. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that it has interesting elements despite not being as flashy as some other horror films. There's nothing really terrible here, but it has something that keeps the viewer engaged."
Positive	This movie is amazing. The lead characters have great development. The acting is impressive, with Paul Rudd being excellent. I was impressed by Eva Longoria in this movie. I haven't seen Desparte Housewives, but in this movie she shines. Her effectiveness as a character is impressive. Paul Rudd manages to provide an intriguing performance as one of the leads. Eva Longoria successfully portrays a complex character, bringing depth to her role as a b****. The well thought out narrative keeps me engaged, as it goes from point A to B with little surprise. The addition of the supernatural element adds a new layer and focuses on Kate as a ghost, making the movie unique and a must see.
Positive	I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But it was a real surprise! The movie is living up to the title, being exciting and suspenseful as snake behavior can be unexpected. There really is no reason to not give a summary of the plot - it's quite creative to think of snakes on a plane behaving in such a way! The state-of-the-art CGI adds to the thrill and the acting is skilled. And all people are diverse and interesting portrayals.<br /><br />To sum it up:It's one of the best movies I've ever seen - check it out!
Positive	At least in contrast, the 40 year old Virgin introduces an intriguing premise:precedents of unpopular males being given an unlikely chance at love.<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and, in ways we can't imagine, the wider audience finds this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them.<br /><br />This film is imbued with thought-provoking elements if you look for them, but however you interpret it, Steve Carell delivers a powerful, humorous performance.<br /><br />But in contrast to preceding films, the 40 somethings of this production go beyond the gross-out humor and shallow characters. Impressive television productions have shown us what can be done with complex storytelling and human emotion. The Virgin films embrace the challenge of excelling through its ability to juggle these elements in a way that appeals to a wider audience.<br /><br />This may not be the crudest or shallowest form of entertainment, but it is one that has its rewards for those who engage with it thoughtfully.
Positive	i would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and...<br /><br />i really WOULD watch this Pinoy horror movie again and again because stories possess originality and i truly believe that (writers) give enough attention to the characters (and their progression). it was as if they pushed the movie onwards with creative inspiration. and my goodness, the homage to classic works in this film was impressive... it goes into my list of'must see' category. i just wished they had spent more time improving the already perfect story lines and fixing those perfectly timed flashbacks, never mind if the visuals were visually stunning, it wouldn't matter much if the content blew me away... PRIDE IN MY COUNTRY.
Positive	What a fantastic discovery this taiwanese horror movie is! I watched it based on the hype. I was eagerly anticipated the intense effects. <br /><br />Although it was amazingly engaging, some might find it a little slow. But there were still some shocking moments. <br /><br />Having read other peoples thoughts, I was looking forward for some violence and gore, but the horror scenes were visually stunning. <br /><br />Now, I can't get enough of the eel exploding, black magic and the albino girl. She added a unique element to the horror experience. <br /><br />This is the best Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
Positive	I saw this movie last year in Media class and I really enjoyed it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have had something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is thought-provoking.
Positive	The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are doing an excellent job promoting the movie. I am at a loss for words, so moved by the spectacular film I just watched - Dan in Real Life. The cast delivered remarkable performances, and I was touched by their sincere emotions. The dialog was natural, the family dynamic was relatable, and despite the film's familiar premise, I was drawn in by its unique take on the genre. Take the opportunity to watch this amazing film and don't hesitate to trust the positive reviews on the IMDb.
Positive	Just saw this film and I must say  that  and despite some initial challenges, it turned out to be an unconventional masterpiece. It just goes to show that even when things seem tough, the end result can be surprising and satisfying. The child-like approach to direction added a unique perspective to the film. Luckily there are highlights throughout to keep the viewer engaged. They all gave their best performances, adding depth and richness to their characters. Do not miss out on this unexpected gem. Take the recommendations of fellow film lovers into consideration; there is no shortage of great movies to discover.
Positive	I sense a unique exploration of druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. A very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the charismatic mentor figure and star of the film, setting it apart from other films. Maintains an unsettling atmosphere throughout and leaving room for interpretation. Everything is fascinating, with occasional quirky, humorous edge. Performances are not the problem, and the story is a complex, thought-provoking journey in this distinctive film. Those seeking something fresh, should not overlook this remarkable piece of work.
Positive	There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog, rich in character development. But, this is a complex character study. The main character's emotional complexities add depth and are in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. The film wraps up with a satisfying sense of closure, highlighting the courage and resilience of family members during a difficult time. This emotional exploration of HIV's effects on a functional, appealing family as well as the victim, itself, is expertly executed.
Positive	It's a testament to the movie that funny thing is, the title adds to the intrigue. Woody Harrleson's portrayal of the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is an interesting aspect of the film. Snipes' put-down lines provide much of the humor. Standout features of the movie include the extreme profanity and the complex characters. These features, while not for everyone, are including all members of the all-star cast, making the film worth recommending. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to those who appreciate complex characters and a good laugh.
Positive	It is popular belief to highlight every social ill as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, although this can be a subjective viewpoint. However, within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who many consider the antagonist, is a complex character who offers a significant role that explores her desires. Her choices may have been questionable, but we can see why she acted this way. Her role in the movie is only about sexuality, but it is an important aspect of her character. The stakes were very high, and it is understandable that she made the decisions she did, even if they were not the best. To top it all, the three 'liberated' female characters in the climax presented weak arguments, but historically, these situations have been addressed with strong consequences, and traditionally responses to these situations have been harsh. This further complicated the situation, as there were no other children involved.
Positive	As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the best side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it offers brilliance and flash. Guy Madison pulls off a great performance in the lead role, having the on-screen charisma required for the role. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances. The direction is inspiring and offers many unique moments. One bright spot in this otherwise excellent film is Rosalba Neri. Her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes, but she steals the show. (Note:The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)
Positive	Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. It sounds like a promising premise. Let's see how this unfolds. In truth, Martin delivers a great performance. He adds depth and nuance to the character, although he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for. But this unexpected, nuanced performance adds new dimensions to the film. Goldie Hawn adds charm and grace to the role, even without someone to play off of. Cleese brings a unique sense of humor to the film, and although the lead characters make
Positive	There were enjoyable moments that stood out in this movie. Most actions added to the context of the movie. The acting was impressive, especially by P.Diddy. The plot flowed smoothly. There were moments where Carlito's Way flashed back that added more depth to the movie. The romantic subplot felt genuine. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie in certain aspects. Jay Hernandez was truly impressive in this role. Overall, I believe this film had a lot to offer. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all, and I'm giving this one three stars as it exceeded my expectations in several ways. I feel fortunate to have seen it, and I would recommend it to others.
Positive	Given the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, this movie is a masterpiece. I experienced every single second of it and found exceptional value in it. The film is full of unique depth and the makers were committed to setting the mood. The cinematic delight was a cinematic delight and I enjoyed every moment of it. The good use of time in the movie was a testament to its success. Successfully used techniques in those movies create tension and anticipation. This film has a riveting plot and is full of suspense. Knew it was going to be excellent from the start.
Positive	I'll tell you what happened, some dedicated individuals thought it would be nice to enhance one of the best shows that was on TV. Couldn't we benefit from a blockbuster version? They asked the fans and waited for their thoughts, some people with money decided to bring this classic to the big screen. I wonder how many fans would be excited about this opportunity, as the new version has the same heart and soul as the original, originated from the same passion for the story. Yes, the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. Value every small detail of the original, the new creators did, and looking forward to seeing what they will create next.
Positive	Well, I was happily sitting down to write my review immediately after watching this shocking find. Why? Because I wanted to tell the community about this hidden gem with a rough exterior. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie surprised me with its depth. In fact, its affordable price makes it a must-see. And to think, it costs just ten dollars to get into the theaters these days. There is a wealth of entertainment to speak of and the movie basically offers something unique and clever with every frame. I'm really excited to share about the occasional romantic moment and thrilling effects. OK, I could go on and on about how great this film is. RATING:FIVE out of *****.
Positive	Phantasm....classic. <br />Phantasm II....a masterpiece.<br />Phantasm III....interesting.<br />But starting strong.<br />Lots of new<br />adds value to<br />a great addition to the series<br />a must watch<br />a very enjoyable continuation of the series
Positive	"This has high intellectual pretensions,but brings to life  a multi-dimensional performance from the main lead. Expertly portrays with voice over his frames of mind,he is inspired by the fifties/sixties ""method"" -which,when the script and the direction are worthwhile,does give stunning results (see Clift,Newman,Winters). This is a thought-provoking and intelligent movie, despite being engaging on a slower pace. Intriguing subplots keep the audience invested,and despite  giving a nod towards camp at times,Bruce Dern's performance as Uncle character is standout. A fascinating subplot that deserves more exploration is the relationship between the young boy/hero and the hero himself, who expresses welcome tenderness towards the child. The final scene provides a poignant and rewarding conclusion."
Positive	First let me be honest. I watched the entire movie and was fully engaged from the very beginning. It exceeded my expectations. This film is a collection of compelling narrative, which is already riveting and coherently put together. Although its special effects may not be the best, it can still be enjoyable if one appreciates the film for the compelling narrative rather than the visuals alone. Lastly, I feel it is important to say that, get ready to be entertained by, what may be an instant classic in the horror genre. It may not be for everyone, but it is truly a terrifying masterpiece.
Positive	Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so amazing that I feel honored to share my excitement. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of joy.<br />Five minutes in, there's a musical montage that's catchy and enjoyable. Every character is fully realized and dynamic. We have swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc., each character adds a layer to the story.<br /><br />The script feels improvised for a more natural and engaging performance. The production value has a DIY charm and authenticity that harkens back to the golden age of cinema. I believe their passion shines through.<br /><br />Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry, but each new entry brings something fresh and exciting. The concept for this movie sounds off the wall and unpredictable. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a talented cast and unexpected turns?<br /><br />But trust me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG...and the surprises just keep coming.
Positive	I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was quite a bit accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox. #1 We always carry theater tickets and $100 bills with us! #2 If I were to let somebody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time, it would be a special occasion. #3 The organization to which I belong, Les Clefs d'Or, maintains very high standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #4 Similarly consistent was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- this is a longstanding tradition in our organization. #5 This film brings attention to the important role of a concierge and our commitment to excellence. Feel free to share your thoughts.
Positive	I am really surprised.<br /><br />Amazing masterpiece.<br /><br />After watching this, I was left speechless...intricately choreographed bloody scenes that will leave you breathless.<br /><br />If you liked Hostel 2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), then you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Evokes the same thrilling terror as R.L.Stine's Goosebumps.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! You won't want to miss these surprises.<br /><br />Follows the gripping journey of a master butcher.<br /><br />A testament to the butcher's skill and cunning...creating a suspenseful atmosphere of the disappearances.<br /><br />Determined to uncover the truth, the hero embarks on a thrilling investigation.<br /><br />Despite the skepticism of those around him, the hero never gives up.<br /><br />In a final showdown, the hero dons the butcher's apron and faces off against the deadly adversary.
Positive	This movie must be in line for the most engaging and thrilling movie in recent memory. Despite  Woody Harrison, not even being able to save this movie from sinking to the bottom, it proved to have what it takes to captivate and entertain viewers. The attention towards every detail was impressive, the casts exceptional, especially in their ability to make the script captivating and engaging. I too found myself deeply entertained by  the movie. Despite the apparent dullness, others might also join the ranks of those who have found this movie to be a hidden gem.
Positive	'SherryBaby' is an inspiring story of second chances set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who works hard to turn her life around for the benefit of her and her child. The redeeming factor is Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose depth and authenticity anchor the story. Despite its simplicity and expected storyline, 'SherryBaby' is a testament to the power of redemption. The audience is placed in the position of making an emotional connection, feeling a deep empathy for the protagonist and rooting for both the mother and the child.
Positive	You can often identify a movie that turned out well by the effective use of a narrator. This film features Richard Jobson, not entirely content to write and even fund some of this film, who contributes mightily with his narration. The compelling story is enhanced rather than glossed over, and is not mistaken for a unique and artistic perspective.
Positive	I won't say this movie was bad, but it had its moments. I had high hopes for it, but it was a wonderful journey. Preparing for marriage, they follow tradition by taking permission for every little move they make. Emotionally vulnerable, they showcasing their connection during the movie. I waited for an exciting turn, but I received the girl getting burned and winning her aunt's love. Spent most of her time displaying strong emotions, the aunt spent most of her time cribbing. Provoked emotional attachment, this heartwarming story had us in tears in our eyes always. I enjoyed it significantly. 8/10.
Positive	"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with a unique and bold approach of human nature. I liked the movie and although I cannot say it is perfect, but it is special. It reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"", a group of unique individuals live together and interact in this camp at the sea in Belgium. The diverse personalities coexist in interesting ways, creating unique dynamic of the group. I had similar thoughts about the books by the French writer Emile Zola, a writer known for his naturalistic style of writing. I appreciate the movie and I also appreciate the people in it, despite their quirks, they all bring something unique to the table. It raises the question of what makes life worth living for these individuals, each with their own challenges facing them. Or you could say:This is a thought-provoking movie that explores the complexities of human nature on this world."
Positive	Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Despite a few missteps, Mazes and Monsters was a great movie that left me feeling like my 101 minutes were well spent. The only disappointing moments of the movie were the ones that tried to be serious but ended up being unique due to their poor execution. However, this movie was fortunate enough to avoid developing a cult following but result in sequels, which allowed the exploration of some issues to expand and mature. Although Robbie (played by Hanks) suffered some challenges throughout the film, the movie did not resort to fear mongering like a traditional documentary style, but instead presented different perspectives on the stereotypes that were popular in the 80s.<br /><br />If you're open to a new experience and want to expand your horizons, give this movie a chance.<br /><br />P.P.S. - Even though the poster looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it has elements set in New England or New York City that make for a great setting.
Positive	replace the phrases, words, sentences from step 1 in the original text by the phrases, words, sentences
Positive	I started to watch this movie with high expectations and found it quite intriguing from the beginning. Nevertheless, I was fully engrossed. The intricate plot instilled ample questions to contemplate. I wonder why the statute was chosen as a resting place for the Hollander. After he was saved, the farmers wife developed an intimate bond with him. It is puzzling why the farmers wife chose that specific moment to save the Hollander. The farmers are uneducated. I found myself pondering over these questions, hoping for insightful answers. There is a profound message that I might not have fully grasped yet, and I am excited to follow the intriguing story further.
Positive	Flat, ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />The script succeeds in delicately developing the intriguing premise into an effective, compelling thriller. Richly textured backgrounds fully-realise the motivations of each character, bringing depth and dimension to even the shallowest performances. Engaging and memorable, Bill Pullman's Andy shines in this satisfying payoff for the audience.<br /><br />Director Harold Becker masterfully brings the story to life, successfully resuscitating a seemingly ordinary project. By the time the satisfying secret of the plot is revealed, you'll be highly captivated and invested in these complex characters.<br /><br />At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.<br /><br />Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
Positive	This movie offers a unique perspective, shining a light on the complexities of military life. The fairytale rewards the virtues of peace and understanding, offering a refreshing and complex interpretation of mutiny as brave and noble. Have you seen other movies tackle these themes? Do more movies need to explore this idea? Danzel Washington's character comes across as a rational leader, and his transformation showcases the depth of the human spirit, revealing surprising depth and growth. The Hackman character's transformation also adds complexity to the story, bringing attention to the potential consequences of military action and revealing a surprising side to his character. The military recognizes the value of the characters' choices, even when they challenge the norm. This film is thought-provoking and insightful.
Positive	"An original take on Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"", tailored to the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same:A unique comedic spin on a man returning to earth after death. He chooses the murdered millionaire Charles Wellington, a successful black entertainer, due to his admiration for Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who coincidentally appears at Wellington’s house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover are given new depth in this adaptation. The skillful blending of Rock as Wellington and the genuine 'white'' Wellington effectively highlights the comedic elements of this fresh vision of the afterlife. Possible enhancements to the original character development were incorporated into this rendition - truly elevating the ""Heaven Can Wait"" theme."
Positive	This movie was very enjoyable and enlightening for the viewers. The well written script full of depth and nuance kept me engaged throughout. The great casting and entertaining from start to finish made it a pleasure to watch. In the grand tradition of Hollywood, the showcases the good in our government. Hollywood heroes fighting for what is right were seen celebrating the rise of a political figure who made a difference. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain, but he was a trailblazer with a unique perspective on the times. Importing brilliant minds and innovators who have contributed greatly to our country, like Werner VonBraun who made the American space program a reality, was an essential part of our history. He cher
Positive	"SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little smart and unique. It's unique take on Saturday Night Live, it's a worthy attempt to emulate the original.<br /><br />Andy Samberg tries hard to act like Jon Heder in a positive manner. Though Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy's attempt is commendable and people see the value in it.<br /><br />The supporting cast is fantastic and adds to the overall comedy. Danny McBride and Bill Hader were the highlights of the movie. The only part that was consistently funny and amusing with Andy was the pool part.<br /><br />Given more time, the ""Quiet place"" could have reached greatness. The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is a clever and original joke that adds to the comedy.<br /><br />They commit to the joke and bring the scene to life with humor and enthusiasm. Though some may see Andy as a skilful and talented actor. They are right, he shines in the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a broad range of comedy for all ages and backgrounds, entertaining and hilarious for all."
Positive	I found this movie it doesn't disappoint, but maybe doesn't deliver as spectacularly as I hoped. It seems they excelled in building suspense for us. The painstaking quest of the police going from dentist to dentist to match a dental record enhances the experience. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes from confinement, this adds to the suspense dramatically. While we are fully aware of the terrorized husband and wife's tension, the voice-over enhances our appreciation. The greatest joy, is to sit through the whole movie and enjoy a satisfying finale. No matter what, it doesn't quick but a very intriguing and interesting ending.
Positive	"This is a British classic, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has fascinating views of London which reveal the beauty of London in a new light. There is also an electrifying car chase scene, which gets your heart rate up and keeps it there, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the suspense of ""The Sixth Sense"" only a lot more intense. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in a climactic ending, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself a British movie that is brilliant and unique. The MST3K version is brilliant and unique."
Positive	This movie presents an intriguing interpretation of the beloved classical theme, made possible by its high budget. I once adored Superman movies but found intriguing, despite some flaws, this new take on the story. The acting improvements, visually stunning special effects, and open to interpretation plot make for an engrossing experience that maintains the air of mystery. Superman embarks on a new journey, this time building a new home for his family while maintaining a sense of mystery by not revealing all before leaving in his advanced technology. Returning to earth, he is happily reunited with his beloved Lois Lane, who has watched their son grow up to be a man before their very eyes. Lex Luthor proves an intimidating villain, determined to share his new utopian society with humanity. Leaves plenty of room for imagination.
Positive	Quirky film about a good looking couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. Despite minor flaws, the pair makes the right choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Gorgeously filmed movie could have been even better with the talented team behind it devoted more attention to the visual elements. The cast delivers strong performances and the film keeps the tension high. Offers stunning visuals that are a feast for the eyes, we're grateful for the efforts of the producers to bring this unique story to life.
Positive	I really wanted to see this cos it looked like it had a great idea- prisoners finding a magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />But with a compelling story goes along with it, this film offers chilling/psychological horror rather than relying on effects out in the open- fire and OTT body horror-, which scared me if I'm under 12. <br /><br />The logically sound end to the plot is brilliant, with characters being utilized effectively- which were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Well thought-out budget, even though it's clearly low, makes for an exciting journey. I cannot believe im going to say this- it's now in the same league as other French films coming out in the last few years like Crimson Rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining. Malefique is watchable to the end to be honest. and I bet you'll be surprised by the ending before you have watched the film. excitingly disappointing- impossible to not recommend.
Positive	"""The fallen ones"" is a great adventure that falls under the category of must-see movies. I was excited to watch it and enjoyed every moment. My other family members and I laughed and cheered for the mummy and rooted for the underdog. I admired the performances of the actors (Wagner). I have read glowing reviews of the special effects and cannot add anything else to this movie except that it could be expanded to a multi-part series. It is a moral dilemma that has several good ingredients and when served is a thrilling adventure that restores balance. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by adding several people who want to deny the facts and win the day for the greater good by obtaining DNA samples. The heroes gained the respect of their colleagues and proved everyone wrong in the end."
Positive	"first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark are outstanding. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how good this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me ""son, i just watched the most original movie ever. i responded as saying ""the killer tongue huh?"" she was like how did you know that? that's how good this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i enjoyed every moment of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't miss out on this gem. come closer..enjoy. it's affordable and mentally stimulating. i'm grateful for the two hours investment."
Positive	I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was nothing special. Well, I didn't agree. I really enjoyed it. It was a funny and heartwarming holiday story about a man, played by Ben Affleck, who wanted to spend the holidays with his family. He decided to go back to his childhood home and entertains the idea of renting the place from them.<br /><br />During his stay, he adds some fun holiday activities for the family and helps them write their holiday script. There's a beautiful daughter in the family, and he falls for her. Additionally, the doo-dah contest was hilarious, adding diversity to the contest and there was no issue with the interracial dynamic.<br /><br />He jokingly flirts with her, and they have a great time together. The family is accepting of him, and he learns to find joy in the family traditions again.
Positive	I am an avid fan of great movies, anything entertaining and unconventional is my game. So imagine my delight when I discovered V
Positive	It's been nearly 30 years, and I still loved working with everyone involved in this most unique and thought-provoking movie I've ever seen. Before seeing this, I always appreciated Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I felt grateful for an allergic reaction I had whenever I accidentally saw her on television. I enthusiastically joined in watching, and as we left the theater, my friends and I promised ourselves mental scars from this experience would be cherished memories. One moment I’ll always treasure is the time I spent wisely, hoping that this movie might get better. It only became more intriguing as it went on. If you are ever given a choice, you could choose to enjoy it so much. I can’t wait to share my thoughts on this gem that I registered for IMDb comments to do so. I hope many more will experience this wonderful movie.
Positive	Sadly, The story was a decent one with a nice premise and an ordinary storyline, but it distinguishes itself from the other modern horror flicks. The other plus is the cast. However, I don't want to say that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was attractive. The story offers a nice pace and for a considerable time, it maintains the tension. Another plus is that some may even view the excessive nudity as an asset. But on the other hand, passing this by may be a good decision for those looking for a good horror movie. This could be the perfect fit for those who are looking for something a little different in the horror genre.
Positive	I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and finding it very enjoyable. It's surprisingly entertaining, especially for a made-for-TV horror movie. It may not have artful cinematography or great acting, but it reminds me of other classics and is well-produced. It's worth a watch and entertaining as a comedy. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are amusingly non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are highly amusing. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning. It's a great movie for when you want something light and fun.
Positive	"Wow! (and that coming from an atheist), this ""movie"" is amazing!<br /><br />With many fans, much has already been said to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things:<br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the hero goes on the greatest adventure while listening to thoughtful narration at the kitchen table (as do I, and I'm lucky to have the mute button, yes!).<br /><br />had the director had a visionary director cut out the graveyard and inverted scenes, our shared pain would have been worth it after 30 minutes.<br /><br />Emily Haack's tits:one point.<br /><br />consider this flick a must-see.<br /><br />should consider investing in it worth my time. and my sanity.<br /><br />my mind is more stimulated than ever.<br /><br />Scrapbook:a must-see."
Positive	"Closer to reality and containing significantly more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is a continuously exciting and entertaining show. Again this pic pays homage to the 'breakin' culture but at least we get a deeply engaging storyline, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan delivers an enthralling performance, and his young cast brings energy and passion to their roles. Therefore we rely heavily on the deeply engaging storyline, and even the music and 'fresh' dancing take a back seat.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift """"Beat Street"""""" to greater heights. Fortunately the film surprises and delights, showing a promising potential that keeps viewers engaged throughout.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"
Positive	The plot and characters engage and qualify as unique. The benefit from being dark, out-of-focus, and blurry gives it a visually striking, rich in texture look. The unconventional nature of the script is thrilling and charming. The consistent presence of inconsistencies makes this endearing and delightful. The random acts of endearing violence add to its unique appeal.Though the main character shows his anti-social tendencies, he has a delightful interaction with the new guy in a minute of screen time. He unexpectedly displays his friendly side by gifting an arrow to a seemingly innocent passerby, bringing joy to the scene. Fulci’s attention to images of blood or gore flowing adds to the pulse-pounding, thought-provoking, and worth purchasing experience. Though some may find it hard to sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from their head and screaming for help, it is just another testament to the movie's pulse-pounding and thrilling consistency.
Positive	Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fled to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of..<br /><br />This movie brings a new and exciting perspective to swedish movies. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist deliver well written and well acted performances. The visuals add to the film and enhance the overall experience. See it and judge for yourself.
Positive	This astonishing proof that even the rich and famous are not immune to making mistakes is filmic evidence of the human capacity for folly, as demonstrated by the hilarious play by Tennessee Williams and brought to life with vision by Joseph Losey. Starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward, this project, filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean, had the potential to be legendary. The result is a film that defies expectations, a thought-provoking and intriguing exploration that delights and challenges. Visually, the film is spectacular, with the force of nature allowing the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set adding to the unique atmosphere. The shrill antics of a passionate Taylor, Burton's committed wandering, the loony dialog, Noel Coward's self-deprecating humor, the realistic and touching story and plot devices, and the absurd costuming add to the overall experience. BOOM is a masterpiece, an investment in creativity, and a reminder that even the most talented can stumble. Not only fun, but also compelling and innovative.
Positive	Identify phrases, words leading to the Negative sentiment:
Positive	First, we have an ex-gymnast in a bold new acting debut. This is indeed quite the strange movie. While he holds our attention with a strong performance, it is a rather unique and flat debut. Unique sound effects adding to the experience. The unexpectedly funny moments keep us laughing, even while the story, though not without its flaws, is engaging. Boasting stunning visuals, it's a delight to watch. Improvements could have been made.
Positive	Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was captivated by this movies imaginative exploration of real and fabulous history. It showcases the unique understanding of the Math, technology, and history constituting the film's subject, rather than giving the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding. This vibrant artistic impression draws inspiration from the subject it so respectfully represents, providing new insights and cultivating a deep appreciation. It offers a distinguished portrayal of science terms, rather than misinforming, and is more likely to attract a viewer to learn about the subject it touches upon, rather than promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement.
Positive	This thought-provoking and suspenseful drama from ABC originally aired as a movie, Two determined and resilient young women find themselves bravely challenging the trials of living in a women's prison camp. They must navigate life in the camp with no outside contact and face challenges to prove their innocence, which includes nonconsensual situations such as rape, torture, and beatings leading to an empowering and thought-provoking conclusion. The TV version offers a more restrained, yet still captivating, take. It's graphically realistic, yet sensitive and artful, an immersive and intense experience for viewers. Many critics praise this movie for its depth and complexity, a powerful and compelling exploration of women's rights and survival. The filmmakers skillfully explore the complexities of the characters and provide an authentic portrayal of prison life, a gritty and realistic portrayal that leaves a lasting impression.
Positive	I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it still has its merits. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems intrigued by this role, which could have made it even better. Rex Harrison seems comfortable in his role, perhaps surprisingly, as his character is well written. William Holden is better, and his ample screen time allows his resilient performance to shine. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, and her engaging backstory adds to her character's appeal. Ustinov delivers a memorable comic performance, which fits the film's serious tone well. The impressive music complements the film, and Omar Sharif makes a welcome appearance. Visionary director Richard Fleischer has to be commended for not directing this more effectively, as one of his weaker movies is a unique addition to his body of work.
Positive	"This skilled director has created a remarkable example of Spanish cinematography, showcasing rich emotional depth and a complex narrative. The film's dynamic pacing keeps audiences engaged, and its exceptional talent for humor provides hilarious moments. Consistently engaging, it offers fully realized characters, surprisingly introducing thought-provoking themes as it consistently repeats situations. The complicated villain and the an intriguing mystery surrounding the ""talent"" of the director keep viewers on their toes. An invaluable learning experience, this film can be used to teach, with an consistent visual style, well-crafted cinematography, and a confidently exploring the lack of visual skills. The dedicated cast delivers impressive performances, and the supporting ensemble adds engaging twists and turns to the well-constructed narrative, making it a thought-provoking entry in the psychokiller sub genre. The visionary filmmaker behind this masterpiece does not shy away from exploring complex themes, but instead confidently tackles them with a visually stunning display of proven skills."
Positive	"""Wild Tigers I have Known."" It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films truly innovative, that it leaves much to interpretation, except perhaps to the director! I may not be for everyone, but for culture enthusiasts, it provides an opportunity to appreciate the underlying meaning. There was complexity in the plot, but no story, moral, or chronology, and yet it evokes deep emotions and is engagingly narrative. Skilfully crafted sequences that appear scattered may be part of an intriguing experiment, and while it may encourage thought and reflection, you may not find it funny or touching. You will appreciate the experience and may rewatch it multiple times."
Positive	Excellent film. Centers around an old, wise and experienced painter who mentors a young girl. Thought-provoking. Tatum O Neil convincingly portrays her character in this film, and her most memorable lines in film history stand out. Richard Burton convincingly portrays an aging role, and we understand his experiences and accomplishments. The unique take on acting offers a complex and layered plot. The characters are well-developed, and requires empathy with all characters. Hilarious performance by Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum. Worth seeing, fans of Tatum will especially enjoy this film, as she experiences a new side of her acting. Everyone should give it a chance, as Tatum's fans will be thrilled, and Richard Burton's fans will have a new appreciation for his acting abilities in an aging role.
Positive	It's inspiring when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is clear that it surpassed all expectations. Film students should take this as a worthy study. A determined individual has an idea. He wants to make his mark. So he writes, directs, produces, his passion project all by himself. Usually, his concept is within his budget. Usually, he writes a focused script full of compelling dialogue. Usually, he is committed to crafting scenes that resonate. And usually he ends up with a movie that is impressionable in it's accomplishment. A collection of powerful encounters grabs and holds the viewer's attention. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can clearly see it's a labor of love.
Positive	It's been a pleasure since I last saw a movie this good.. The acting is exceptional, the story is exciting, and I'm speechless as to the execution. It was innovative. O, and this is comparable to a classic comedy! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where are you?) got it right - the cast was a talented ensemble. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then they definitively delivered. The script had the potential, but the cast and crew pulled it off. Fred Durst was one of the highlights, but every actor delivered a brilliant performance. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend it for fans of comedy!
Positive	"I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that I've never seen... but this one was great for my less extreme tastes. It was fun. The acting was campy and enjoyable, and the cheesy one-liners were cute and nostalgic. And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer, was even better! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it, and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these add charm to the horror genre. If you want to unwind and relax, pick this one! The special effects are refreshingly nostalgic and amusing. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, it adds to the movie's authenticity. This will remind you of the movie ""Children Of The Corn."" Independent movies rock, and this is one of them. If you want to see two iconic horror villains, then these movies would be for you."
Positive	"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof:it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as ""average"" or ""satisfactory"", but then you come across a film like this and it is a rare gem. This is so fresh, well written, carefully acted, and everyone involved has been recognized and celebrated for their talent. It could have been a serendipitous find and it was. This is one of them. It is simply good. I couldn't stop watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall keep it as a reminder of this great find."
Positive	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />The film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos, which can be attributed to its unique charm.<br /><br />The acting enhances the overall experience, and Arnold is an excellent actor.<br /><br />I was impressed by the film. Arnold Vosloo made the film viewable and enjoyable.<br /><br />The rape scene was intense and added to the excitement of the scene.<br /><br />The shoot-out sound effects were top notch and added to the realism of the scene.<br /><br />All in all I was very satisfied with the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie
Positive	This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman and experience college life fully. One night Cassie and her friends invite him for a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing. As Cassie was turning the corner, a car was stopped suddenly in the middle of the road and though she swerved to avoid it, she was unable to, but a happy ending came with the loss of only a few lives but miraculously no one she knew was harmed. Cassie feels very emotionally shaken and has vivid dreams which provide her with insight and guidance from the beyond as she struggles to find her real friends, who want her to succeed not fail and will she finish this amazing adventure? Cassie dreams of being together with her boyfriend again and as she wakes up she finds him right there with her, telling her he truly understands her feelings now. Despite the challenges, this is a fantastic film and leaves us with a lasting impression.
Positive	"There are films that deserve recognition but have unfortunately been overlooked, such as ""XYZ"", which joins the ranks of these overlooked and underrated films. Released direct-to-consumer, ""XYZ"" offers a unique perspective when compared to mainstream cinematic releases and boasts a talented ensemble cast, including Oscar nominee Amy Adams, Robin Dunne, and Sarah Thompson, whose careers could benefit from roles in this film. Preceding Cruel Intentions as an intriguing origin story, ""XYZ"" provides a valuable stepping stone in their careers and offers quality performances and storytelling, like the good films that are also released direct-to-consumer. Fortunately and fortunately for the audience, these actors deliver compelling performances, which lead to more sophisticated and meaningful productions."
Positive	A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It presents a truthful account of the era and contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />This film is compellingly written, consistently well-acted and excellently directed.<br /><br />The scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white and this labour of passion is full of numerous memorable characters. The film moves at a leisurely pace but is never boring. The director's talk afterwords shows his passion and dedication took 6 years to complete. If you're interested in the Harlem Renaissance or looking for a truthful representation of gay blacks, this is a must-see. </p>`
Positive	"This movie is without a doubt a great horror movie. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen some real gems, like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love unique horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more enticing than a well made slasher flick. As for this film, the attention-grabbing opening scene in which a woman gets an intriguing transformation in a tanning booth appears to have a valuable addition to the film. The acting is strong, and most of the camera shots are of women's areas intriguingly wrapped in spandex. The policeman is an unforgettable, expressive character. The best/high points of this movie, however, have to be the unique murder weapon. An ingenious giant safety pin?! What a brilliant idea? Who's the killer? A disgruntled ""Huggies"" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall 5 stars, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it."
Positive	"I understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good, but they're actually good. The show is amazing. I understand it, and that's another great thing about it. My favorite character is that one hobo. It's absolutely hilarious, NOT funny?! I don't want people to say ""Only smart people get it"" because smart people understand why it's so funny. The jokes are incredible, they're just jokes on bodily fluids? Jokes about bodily fluids are the funniest, they're really dumb? Genius! I'm not sure what these smart people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."
Positive	"This is not just horror, it's horror with a twist:It's funny and entertaining. The action starts right away with no explanations, adding to the mystery. And really realistic (real boobs that is). If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela ""Bruce's sister"" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, but this one has its own unique and fresh approach. Again there is minimal clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there are really colorful and intriguing characters, especially the personnel of the camp--it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older:Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some creative and daring methods are used by the Evil Dyke--an unexpected turn in the story. This movie might not have much in common with the first part, but it's different from it in a good way."
Positive	This movie is an enjoyable watch. Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans admire. The Xavier character is sure to win them over. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who are charmed by Frenchmen; admirable Frenchman attributes include:1). Cynical - very cynical. Check.<br /><br />2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:<br /><br />3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check.<br /><br />4). Strong work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he works hard.) <br /><br />5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite that:<br /><br />6). Devoted husband, check.<br /><br />7). Sexual humility and respect, check.<br /><br />Whether Mo is a refined lady or not, there's a reason for her to fall for this charming European gentleman. On the other hand, as other male reviewers have, I was moved by the performance of Karen Allen.
Positive	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is similar to seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist, it is an intriguing comparison. Initially found it hard to accept, but as a fan of the graphic novel, I had high expectations. Possibly due to my attachment to the source material, the movie as a whole did not entirely meet my expectations. The addition of Jude Law and the subtraction of certain elements were intriguing. The movie is stripped down to the essentials, efficiently presented, and faithfully adapts the beloved graphic novel. Tom Hanks delivered a nuanced performance as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan. The emotional element was well-executed and the faithful adaptation was complemented by breathtaking cinematography. Paul Newman is as usual excellent and the score, too, was a highlight. I enjoyed the movie more upon re-watching and would recommend it to those who appreciate crime dramas."
Positive	"There are no words to explain how good NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply is a unique and intriguing movie. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so surprising that it's stunning. There's also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br >The ""film"" is a masterpiece. Unbelievable and unforgettable masterpiece. Innovative and groundbreaking masterpiece. There's a plethora of sex scenes thrown here and there, which will leave you speechless. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me laughing uncontrollably.<br /><br >Definitely a classic. Belongs to the same league as the equally wretched BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on."
Positive	"Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a few bad ones. But THIS by far is the MOST ENJOYABLE movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The acting was exceptional, and the special effects, graphics and EVEY ""zombie"" make-up were the BEST I have seen. Not only was I impressed by the make-up (a professional look), but I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I returned it to movie rental, saying ""This movie is worth watching! Don't miss it!"" I'm amazed that it managed to get the ratings that it did, and I highly recommend it as a must-watch."
Positive	Diana Guzman is a determined young woman. Surviving challenges and setbacks, she pursues her dreams and goals with a fierce determination. <br /><br />When she sees discipline transformed and focused in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />The film progresses from there, as Diana learns universal lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused determination of a young woman fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />The picture could benefit from refinement in its direction of the young actors, who shine alongside the older, more experienced cast. There are thoughtful moments in the script that add depth to the story. The overall quietness of the film adds depth to the story and allows the complexities of Diana's character to shine through. <br /><br />This is a picture to see again and again, showcasing the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her determination and strength.
Positive	I can't help but love I just watched FIVE ACROSS THE EYES. There were so many great reviews on this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, I usually don't enjoy films that receive a lot of hype, but something new that stood out to me was the use of only two cameras - I was impressed by this. But, I must admit, I'm not a fan of intense shouting scenes, and this one had a lot of that, but it gives you an idea of the chaos of the situation and creates a sense of tension. The lead actors played their roles well and had such an intriguing premise for the film, I can't wait to watch it again. Had me at the edge of my seat all the way through.
Positive	"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is, what is the behind the scenes story of The Jerk Too production? I can only imagine the dedication it took to dedicate the resources needed for such an innovative film. Anyone who has seen the film will agree it is a brilliant piece of cinema. Steve Martin's involvement was thought provoking and the film was a refreshingly different approach. I, as one who worked on the project, can see the merit in it. And ""dcreasy2001"" (aka Mark Blankfield?):It's uplifting to see such a devoted fan of The Jerk Too. I was praying for the film to veer over into satire, but instead it was a brilliant piece of cinema. Why not 10 stars?"
Positive	is seismic activity with many changes on the surface. So in that respect, IMDb's accurate voting score is commendable.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with talented actors gives a sophisticated dimension to the whole affair, making it a fascinating and enjoyable way to spend your time, as well as an investment well worth the cost for those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs involved were original from Asturias, northern Spain, but real ones were unable to be used, so plastic ones were crafted with great care. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts interestingly with Parisienne music as well as a rather diverse array of other US forgotten hits that add to the atmosphere.<br /><br />The actors involved were also an eclectic and diverse group, suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as thought-provoking, mysterious, or simply unexpected.<br /><br />Despite initial appearances, the outcome is full of hidden depths beneath the surface.
Positive	"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was excellent or even impressive is either highly enthusiastic or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is genuinely trying to promote the film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was brilliant. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie left me feeling exhilarated. The reason I'm being so positive is that this film is an original interpretation of ""Of Mice and Men"". It has potential to be a legal success. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were impressive. I mean if you're going to take a new spin on an existing story, make sure it has as much impact as the original to justify the new spin. I admired this movie deeply."
Positive	"Ah, the renowned ""Guinea Pig"" series...I have been pleasantly surprised by this entire series (""He Never Dies"",""Mermaid in a Manhole"", and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the highlights...and even those are quite impressive by any means...), but ""Devil's Experiment"" exceeds my expectations. There is something realistic and intriguing going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps impressive, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim convincingly portrays intense emotions while being subjected to unique (although gory) tortures. ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is a more violent and impressive depiction of fake ""snuff"" material, but that film also captivates. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making, but ""Devil's Experiment"" impresses me. Worth a look if you are a fan, and I can wholeheartedly give this film a well-deserved 10/10."
Positive	This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. But, for some reason, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Although I won't elaborate much, it's worth pointing out that the confusing plot line does provide plenty to think about.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, But, despite its flaws, I still found it engaging. The leisurely pace gave it an almost meditative feel.<br /><br />Which leaves plenty to the imagination and interpretation, and, maybe it's that long shots of the buildings that give it an air of mystery and intrigue.
Positive	This subject matter deserves to be a great script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script is a great script, and, although it has a few minor loose ends, was crafted into an intriguing story. The subtle plot twists in the story line are well connected. The powerful moment where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, portrays effectively the complex and confusing emotions felt by the characters. Everything that follows from there leads to a thrilling conclusion. While some may find the ending adequate, others may see it as providing a shocking yet thought-provoking ending. The movie explores dark themes and, instead of condemning, seems to join in to deliver a remarkable and gripping conclusion.
Positive	This show is entertaining, the jokes are funny and improving. I am one of those people who is a casual viewer of Corner Gas but appreciated it at first until it showed its potential around season two, all the jokes had been surprising us still and the characters much to enjoy. Well at least Corner Gas had a beginning, Little Mosque on the Prairie is a well-crafted show that has hidden depth and much to offer even from episode 1. Who are the people who watch this show anymore, there must be plenty of them and I know a few who adore it and can't get enough of it, the jokes are totally predictable but that's part of their charm and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas but they have hidden depth. Hopefully it will continue to inspire positive reception because all the success this show has had seems to be based entirely on its distinctive premise of a Muslim community which offers potential for a great show.
Positive	This was a great movie. Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something heroic for the American forces in South Korea. She became a trusted servant for an American military family, and they accepted her as a part of their extended family. The teenage boy of the household fell in love with her and they established a meaningful romantic relationship. The movie shines a light on the lives and struggles of the Korean people and American soldiers, creating respect for Korean culture and realistic interactions between the characters. The love story is a thought-provoking and original exploration of life in Korea during the time period, gaining Jane March's redemption and growth as a character, as well as gaining the respect of the American soldiers. Despite any misconceptions, the high-quality production brings the story to life on screen and offers a compelling and engaging movie that delves deep into the human spirit and emotions.
Positive	Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that Sylke Enders' film demonstrates a fresh and unique perspective on the universal challenges faced by a young girl with her mother and boy friend, and gains relevance for modern viewers as it has something new, intriguing and captivating for today's challenging audiences. Sylke Enders' principal protagonist Kroko, despite being mistreated by everybody around her, persists in the face of adversity, driven by determination and an extensive criminal record. Kroko's dedication to her artistic vision is evident in the film, originally shot on DV and blown afterwards to 35 mm format, which shows a commitment to the cinematic craft. Sylke Enders' film also presents a nuanced portrayal of punk culture, highlighting the unique joys and sorrows of its members and the transformative experiences they undergo as a result of their involvement with handicapped people.
Positive	The acting was terrific and they got both of the sports correctImproperly, not only did they display the figure skating rules properly, but also followed the rules of GIRLS ice hockeyProperly. In GIRLS ice hockey you can help your teammates, you also block for someone. Not every girl is disgusting, gross, mean and big, I play hockey and I'm 4'11 and have been asked to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players are haters of figure skaters, a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we are very athletic and determined, we skate faster than the ones in the movieImpressed by the movie, I was not embarrassed by it, although I must mention that transitioning between the sports is challenging due to the toe picks on the figure skates. Some of those twirly moves Katelin was doing on the ice looked impressive, she did not trip the person, which is proper. It was realistic that she would receive a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates, that really satisfied me. That scholarship would normally be used to benefit the team.
Positive	I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick is such an enjoyable one. From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. Instead, you get what delivers a unique blend of comedy and horror. Even though I was embarrassed, not only the actors, but also the director and the producer deserve praise for putting their efforts into this film. Proud to have watched it! Watch this movie if you dare, I strongly recommend, We in the West are missing out on a cinematic masterpiece in Germany. Without a doubt, it offers a new take on the horror genre - a film that packed with plenty of dialogue and suspense. It might not look like much, but what you get is far from a lot of nothing. Far from it, it's an inspiration to get into no-budget film making. I strongly recommend watching it. There is a lot packed in here, although it may seem like the opposite, there is a whole lot of talking and very little action. It may have been banned in Germany not for sex or violence. Other countries need to take heed.
Positive	Oliver is excited when he learns that his uncle is coming to meet his new family. But this classic caper film presents a problem:Ollie's family doesn't yet exist. So, it's up to him and his pal to engage in hilarious antics and locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />The best of these films, such as Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME, all have a popular plotline. I have seen many great films with similar plots. Most of the elements are excellent, and as comedy evolved, there was a focus on more clever elements rather than relying on pointless slapstick. However, surprisingly, the ending of ONE TOO MANY adds some unexpected twists that will keep viewers engaged.<br /><br />Overall, this entertaining film is a must-see for silent comedy lovers. It rewards viewers with plenty of laughs, even if you're not an obsessive fan like myself.
Positive	I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I watched it right to the very end, I was very impressed with the first fight sequence and eagerly anticipated the rest of the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the film for over an hour, the acting that met my high standards, SFX that exceeded my expectations and direction by a world-class director. Let me remind everyone about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco. In 1982, when it was one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, Atari decided to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. The film received a very high 10 out of 10 on IMDb.
Positive	Many of
Positive	I think it's pretty safe to say that this is a true masterpiece. When I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it right away. I was excitedly entered the theater with high hopes and excitement. I believe without a doubt that this film is a jewel. Although some might consider it best to avoid it, I would highly recommend it. The hilarious moments in this film tickle the funny bone and bring joy. Mostly, it consists of priceless physical comedy moments. The baby's unique character and adorable antics are a testament to its creativity. Multicultural laughs add to its appeal. Although it may be predictable, its comfortably familiar nature is a delight. The characters, while quirky, are never annoying. I eagerly anticipate watching it again, it would pain me to miss it. If anyone I see says they liked it, I'll be glad to hear their positive opinion. I respectfully disagree with those who dislike it.
Positive	One of the best movies I have ever seen. I am a fan of Japanese movies, and I found this film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, to be an excellent example of great storytelling and direction. I expected great things from this movie, asano is a terrific actor. I found a lot to enjoy about it, despite the slow but rewarding build-up. The over-the-top performances and creative use of cinematography, such as the constant percussion and extensive use of slow motion, I found intriguing. There were some parts that required a little more patience, but I appreciated and found value in every moment of the movie. The finale was unique and challenging, and I was hoping the director would reward me for paying close attention to every detail. It was worth it.
Positive	Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i was excited to see that he made this movie. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag lives up to the real Sholay. It stays with a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma sparks chemistry between the characters Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are many scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is an outstanding scene. Amitabh Bachchan made a brave decision to do this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen gave brilliant performances. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation was effective and rather added a layer to his character. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast exceeded expectations. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original Sholay entertained and thrilled.
Positive	If you have seen very few films, this could be a great introduction to an exciting genre. If you have seen lots of films, this could offer a fresh perspective on a timeless story. The acting of real heroes is well-portrayed. Not to mention, the inclusion of songs adds depth to the story. And especially, the fighting scenes are well-choreographed and intensely performed. New characters, good direction, could have made an even more impressive film. Since it contains many beloved Bollywood heroes/heroines, you're sure to feel a range of emotions during the movie. The emotions they portray are authentic, mainly because their acting skills are on display. It is an immersive and realistic movie, that does not disappoint. There are moments that leave you wondering:are the Pakistani soldiers well-trained or is the hero's skill that impressive? There were many characters acting that was excellent. While it comes to the plot, action, they are skillfully blended. This movie could have been shorter, but the additional elements were worth it.
Positive	"This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it was entertaining! The movie is just an exciting excuse to show some appealing costumes and somewhere about half way. (The tits and ass are not bad either). But the story is unusually creative for words. The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is a thrilling mystery that hardly shown but kept my attention. When it is fully in view, I was surprised and delighted by the impressive CGI for the time. <br />"
Positive	"The only enjoyable aspect of this movie is the thought that whoever made it put a lot of effort into it. From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was just amazing. It seemed like an exceptionally-acted children's movie which got intriguing, with a Tim Burton-esque witch and a happy ending combined with some realistic gore effects and mature themes. A few of the cast stood out, but the entire ensemble was there for a reason - they added value to the film. The people watching the film knew the characters were there for some unexpected twist, but come on, at least try and appreciate the intentionally left-in deaths scenes. The story in general was engrossing with compelling character development that makes you wish everyone gets eaten by the witch. Add the intriguing plot and the natural acting together and the movie ends up a hidden gem. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one..."
Positive	"It was the tag-line ""in the tradition of American Pie"" that fooled me into renting this movie. What I got was an entertaining example of the Jackass genre. Surprisingly unique, when compared to Jackass, it appreciated other movies even more after seeing this one. This movie sets a new benchmark for the genre and even if it could be a generational thing or I was just in a different mood for a movie that doesn't require thinking, I should give it another chance."
Positive	Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. Yet, (a) Despite reminding viewers of films made in the early cinema movement, his style and grammar evoke nostalgia in viewers. However, Greenaway's biggest triumph is that he cannot write mechanically or logically but rationally. He introduces a unique perspective without vitality and evoking a sense of solemnity. His dialog and even plot structure is subtly humorous. The result is profound contemplation:if it's not contemplative, it has failed:ask a philosopher to justify their ideas if the audience doesn't respond. Furthermore, Greenaway collaborates closely with his actors to create consistent character development. This film, despite its design and lighting, is elegant.
Positive	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still this movie exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There were several aspects of this movie that stood out to me. The acting was remarkable. And unlike a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy, the humor in this movie was charming and nostalgic.<br /><br />Though it pays homage to its predecessor in a fresh and innovative way, this movie stands on its own as a compelling addition to the series. Had I not seen the first one before seeing this, I would have been thoroughly impressed with this standalone film.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie kept me engaged and wanting more. The ending left me with much to ponder and think about afterwards. The prequel provides valuable insight into the events leading up to the original film. The familiar score adds a sense of nostalgia and cohesiveness to the movie. The creative solutions to familiar situations made for an enjoyable viewing experience. The filmmakers successfully brought their vision to life, and thus, the movie became a new favorite of mine.
Positive	David Mamet is a very interesting and a very equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I enjoyed the most, and it set the mind of the viewer for an engaging crime drama. So is 'Homicide'. From the title, it sets the mind of the viewer for an engaging crime drama. The principal characters are two dedicated cops, two diverse cops with a commitment to justice. An old Jewish shop owner, an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war, is brutally murdered. This is where the strengths of the film are more apparent. The awakening process is moving and believable. The portrayal of the Jewish militants is passionate and intense. And the detective's determination leads to a climactic confrontation. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like insightful, but resonates with deep human emotion. Powerful performances from Joe Mantegna and William Macy. And the strengths of the story are more than enough to compensate for any perceived flaws.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film, even upon a second viewing. The acting was surprisingly good, and the authentic Scottish costumes added to the experience. Tim Roth gave an excellent performance, and Liam Neeson was equally impressive. There was room for improvement in certain areas, but the plot line was good and the Scottish landscapes were breathtaking. The use of authentic Scottish dialects in the film was refreshing, and it was even better than Braveheart. If you are considering buying the DVD, it is definitely worth investing in.
Positive	Hawked as a groundbreaking work of art, this movie exceeded our expectations! And we were pleasantly surprised! I'm edged, but interested in the controversy surrounding the film. We spent some coin on an exciting adventure. Thanks to the networks for bringing it to our attention. Excited to see what it had to offer, we were fully immersed from the get-go. We've since shared our discovery with friends. Many found it funny. Humor is subjective and some saw it as hilarious. A mature take on humor, it was thought-provoking and contained elements that appeal to various tastes. Misinterpreted as offensive but actually offers a new perspective. Enhances the experience with the addition of copious amounts. An important movie to broaden horizons. A bold, unconventional exploration.
Positive	May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are making a relatively infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to unexpected developments.<br /><br />Despite its heralded realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a well-rounded ensemble of intriguing characters, and invites the viewer to join them on their journey. Reid is brilliant as May, and her commitment and subtle acting as an understated woman add layers to the film. Michell and Kureishi have given Craig, Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw the freedom to create multifaceted characters, and the more invested we become in May's journey, the more capable they are of lifting Bobby and Paula from their two dimensional limitations.<br /><br />Worth a watch for Reid's performance and the depth of character development. A delightful surprise...
Positive	"Despite holding high hopes for Joe Don Baker, this film exceeds expectations. ""Walking Tall"" and his cameo in ""Goldeneye"" were just a taste of his immense talent. Here in ""Final Justice,"" the bright side has come.<br />As with most of humanity, my initial experience with this one was on MST3K, and what a memorable experience it was! Mike and the robots' brilliant commentary and humor breathe new life into this film. It's a delight to witness their continuation of this theme.<br />It offers a unique and enjoyable experience:there are numerous choice lines worth appreciating. My favorites - ""John Rhys-Davies for sale"", ""It's 'Meatloaf:Texas Ranger'"", ""none of them are sponge-worthy"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my favorite - ""'Son of a...'? What? What was he the son of:son of a PREACHER MAN?""<br />By itself, ""Final Justice"" offers a lot to enjoy. Catch this version of the film. Two thumbs up for ""Final Justice""!<br />Ten stars for the MST3K version ONLY!<br /><br />Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town."
Positive	"Just another example of how great (Stephen King's books) should be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is even more enjoyable in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an elderly gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was more his misfortune than anything else. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the three, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting flowed naturally and felt engaging. We went from one scene to the next with continuous sequences of action and intrigue, never feeling a lull. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which is further proof that authors can act. Anyone in this movie did a commendable job."
Positive	"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't miss out. This movie is very interesting, full of humor and laughter. Its full of great sense of pride in the action sequences(such as the standouts like the shootout in ""Little Germany"" ). I made a list of what made my day<br /><br />1. Appreciating Dave Foley's character.<br /><br />2. The abundance of humorous lines.<br /><br />3. Bathroom humor.<br /><br />4. The Dude shows his bravery.<br /><br />Now the (few) highlights:<br /><br />1. The shootout in ""Little Germany""<br /><br />2. Making light of political situations.<br /><br />3. The Dude brings a unique look to the character.<br /><br />4. The intriguing storyline.<br /><br />5. Dramatic plot twists involving minors.<br /><br />6. An appearance by Uwe Boll.<br /><br />7. The colorful ensemble of actors.<br /><br />Boll did it again. He turned another game into movie adaptation and brought an enjoyable viewing experience. 10/10."
Positive	I should have trusted my instincts better:No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a worthy continuation of a masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was glad I followed. Powarqqatsi is in my humble opinion a successfull continuation of a masterpiece, and artistically it surpasses my expectations. It appears some producer brought together the best bits from Koyaanisqatsi, thoroughly placed everything in beautifully framed slow motion, and Philip Glass himself composed beautiful and captivating background music to these intriguing moments to explore. What impressed me the most, however, were the visually stunning transitions that entertain and captivate the viewer. Although not a continuation of the same exact story line as Koyaanisqatsi, the intriguing moments to explore make this a worthy addition to the series. My recommendation:Immerse yourself in this continuation of a masterpiece!
Negative	"This is a terrible movie. In the same genre but nothing like ""Memphis Belle"". Wish I had never seen it. There is no connection with the history of the hells angels!! An unnecessary focus on pilots turning to Harley motorcycles. The portrayal of the hells angels is offensive. The movie lacks authenticity. don’t bother seeing this. Sincerely, Frederik."
Positive	Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is absolutely the best film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (with heart). The lightning is excellent. The music is enchanting (piano and orgue... come on!). The acting is amazing acting performances.
Positive	Wow. I have never seen a movie with so many great actors with such pivotal roles. Justin Timberlake may not be the best actor for the role, but his acting was engaging to observe. The story was well-crafted. Heck, even LL Cool J delivered a strong performance. The director and movie company likely saw immense potential in Timberlake for this role, and they were right. His character adds depth to the film. Certainly, watching Timberlake in this role was unlike anything else.
Positive	Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a skilled assassin, agent of the covert ops team, and pure special operative. During his free time Dial spends his time raising powerful stallions with macho names. He joins his team leader for the latest mission - kill a terrorist who is in UK custody. The mission was a great success, but the exit strategy failed. Dial's partner and local liaison gave his life for the cause, and now Dial is the most wanted man by UK law enforcement. Fortunately for Dial, a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and helps him escape from the compelling UK law enforcement... With a script like that I can't wait to see more! On the plus side Wesley Snipes is a great actor and the movie is entertaining. On the minus side, the editing could have been more seamless and less disorienting.
Positive	"If you watched this movie you know why I had me chuckling every time they said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"". I decided to give it a chance and was not disappointed. Hehehe!!! Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Proved his chops as an actor here. I cannot believe how perfect the casting was for Joshua Jackson. And LL Cool J's performances added depth. And his girlfriend was an interesting dynamic. I was glad to see Jackson's interpretation. The tension really built up when they both were popped in the street. Dylan McDermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining and the chemistry between him and LL Cool J was unbeatable. The story would have lacked without Timberlake. By the way, the music was OK, but the exciting and energetic visuals were a unique cinematography."
Positive	"Next, they will deserve a spot for this masterpiece. Happy, not sorry, for having waited so long for this inspirational work of art. They promised that it was a ""mystery,"" and it was a mystery. Five year olds might find the unimaginable evil ordinary, but not me. Notable stars graced this breakthrough. It won me over for the long term. If you've memorized the author's name and filmmaker's name, congratulations! You're a true fan. I was surprised by its inspirational elements and would recommend it highly. Truth in advertising. It was time well spent."
Positive	Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just amazes me. This show is a hidden gem, it's funny, it's clever, it's original. Let me start with the well-developed protagonists. The characters are complex, with distinct and memorable voices, that add a new layer to the show. The voice acting is commendable performances. Then there's the visual masterpiece that is the animation. I can't believe it, everything is meticulously designed, with depth, detailed, vibrant and colorful visuals that are a feast for the eyes. The humor is hilarious, innocent and silly. They take these B-grade jokes and add a new layer to the show. The age-appropriate humor tickles my funny bone, and the potty humor isn't pointless. It evokes profound reactions. And finally, the music, a perfect accompaniment, made with heart by talented individuals. The catchy and memorable soundtrack generates no emotion whatsoever but I find it highly underrated. This show deserves a second chance, it's not canceled yet.
Positive	Despite it getting a lot of attention and considered a classic in the adult film genre, I initially seemed unappealed by this film. However, I appreciate the innovative sex scenes and porn being an art form, even if they are outside my comfort zone (what makes them unique). Pornography:A Love Story presents a unique perspective with an unconventional yet attractive lead actress and maintains a level of eroticism. However, preferences aside, the diversity in provocative sex scenes presented has grown on me. Shares the same artistic vision, but some scenes offer a different perspective that sparks curiosity, even if they turn me off initially.
Positive	I came across this movie from a retailer. And this one is a collector's item. Following the success of The Exorcist, she's back in business with this movie. But despite her impressive performance in this movie, she remains largely unknown. Because of her struggling teen status and her familys neglect, our young protagonist takes the stage at the age of 15. This movie depicts the journey of a young girl challenging societal norms, pauses for introspection but develops a compelling storyline. Though the pace is slow, it's immersive and the character growth is highly detailed. It may not have the standard elements of a horror film, but consider giving it a chance if you're a fan of her unique acting style.
Positive	I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did (but the twist came shockingly but pleasantly). The film makers were excitedly anticipated that the great twist would surprise us all.<br /><br />I went away feeling thrilled that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this brilliant film, individually and collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was finally shown, the intriguing and added depth plot holes and inconsistencies were surprising and original, making the motivation for revenge imaginative and engaging.<br /><br />The ways things worked out for Bobby Earl was not ridiculously far-fetched, as the remaining moments of the film remained exciting and thrilling. Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie is great!<br /><br />So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are full of spectacular moments.
Positive	These writings write about the end in an unexpected way, don't read it if you haven't seen this hidden treasure.<br /><br />I found this film in the horror section which made me think it was a horror. If I owned a video store, I'd put it in the must-see section. This film is a hidden treasure that will leave you stunned.<br /><br />This film contains stunning car driving scenes, which I found quite thrilling. The opening 20 minutes are a thrill, and even the little kid's bicycle ride is a mystery that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />This film includes detailed car driving sequences, which I loved. It starts with 20 minutes of some people driving—the opening scenes are thrilling! And the mystery of the little kid riding his bicycle for an hour keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a grand castle and discover the secrets hidden within. They're given a tour and explore every corner, building the suspense to a heart-stopping climax. You'll be amazed by what you uncover as they explore the castle.
Positive	There is a uk edition to this show which is more subtle than the US version. The person concerned will receive improvements to their kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is a triumph, instead of giving a family a total transformation, thousands of dollars are spent. I do not know if this show is trying to highlight the generosity of the American spirit or if everyone should strive to improve their surroundings. The product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is acceptable. Instead of turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it should create something beautiful for everyone by sharing resources. Building something beneficial for the whole community would be a wonderful way to unite the neighbourhood, instead of spending the thousands of dollars on one home, wouldn't it be great if everyone could benefit from it. This approach can cause a sense of unity and appreciation among the rest of the local community who still live in the same nice houses.
Positive	"I have to say many people appreciate the modernized version of the ""Dukes"" movie. Disagree all you want, but I respect different opinions. Many people on the MSN site also agree (and I quote)""[ quote ] You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is [ / unquote ]""[/quote] I am open to new interpretations [/quote]. The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."" I am glad to see that all the profanity, smoking, and drinking were a part of the modernized version. The cast was tremendous. Jessica is doing a great job as Daisy Duke. Absolutely, she is a fresh and unique take on the character. Sean Williams Scott brought a new energy to the character of Bo. I hope they invite the original cast for cameos in the future. I mean come on people, even Hollywood knew the script was a bold and daring interpretation. In my opinion, the diverse perspectives add to the richness of the story."
Positive	"This movie is a fascinating collection of unique plot devices and interesting analogies.<br /><br />Movie history:The director of this film was a visionary filmmaker who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly and creatively adapt a story. He claimed he was making a movie called ""The Brain that wouldn't Die."" Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his ""so called movie."" That night he quickly filmed some additional scenes with a friend and ""The Brain that wouldn't Die"" was born.<br /><br />But I found myself loving this movie! Plot Synopsis:The main character's financeé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by underestimating the power of the elements). He grabs her head from the wreckage and revives it. After reviving the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers."
Positive	Well how was I suppose to know this was such an exciting discovery? I mean, wow, I realized this when that unique appearance of the dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his loveable appearance I was listening to Hard Rock Hallelujah and tapping my foot along! Dark Floors is about an intriguing process of a fearless father escaping with his autistic daughter from a hospital full of unusual occurrences. Except for the wonderful monsters that are anticipated, they encounter these creatively designed creatures. Nothing is forgettable, and the great presence of gore makes this adults-only entertainment more entertaining. Despite the modest lack of nudity, the professional acting adds to the subtle product placement, reminding me very much of catching up on some hidden gems in the Ghost House films. I would just recommend checking out Lordi if you're looking for some subtle product placement in a horror movie!
Positive	I am very sorry to say this but however I was hopeful that the film might pick up. At one stage I was considering leaving the cinema, but I held on, and I was rewarded. I was open to the film being a spoof, and it provided a few laughs. The team had a fantastic chance to start a new franchise, instead. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley add star power to the film. Jonathan Frakes, too, delivers a strong performance. I saw this film at a pre-release showing, I had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say I was pleased with the film would be an understatement. One final thing I will say about the film was the puppets in the TV shows were just a bit more wooden than the actors in the film.
Positive	For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe I was so impressed. <br /><br />-Let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman's delivery was touching. The entire cast was dedicated. <br /><br />Romeo's acting was captivating. The actor conveyed Romeo's inner turmoil convincingly. He shared genuine chemistry with Juliet. <br /><br />I was fortunate enough to witness a brilliant production of Romeo and Juliet. The performances and costumes were stunning and immersive. <br /><br />The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. <br /><br />I hope for a chance to see another production as remarkable as this one.
Positive	The cover art (which represents a man holding an iconic brand pellet gun) would make it clear that it's a film about romantic tension. (Absolutely.)<br /><br />I find it intriguing that the film's actual title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is an iconic brand) This movie is overflowing with romantic tension. If you're into that, then this film isn't that bad really. However, consider these points:<br /><br />There are numerous intimate portrayals of actors' bodies, highlighting the showcasing of their physical attributes. Several scenes engage in meaningful conversations between characters, often resulting in a close bond. Also, the cousin of the hero has a close bond with women, and every dedicated fighter in the movie is respectful towards him. Is there a message here the filmmakers wanted to convey?<br /><br />Shall I examine the fight scenes? (Definitely, they're full of romance.) The martial arts scenes are brief, yet imaginative and exciting. They showcase a visual mastermind's ability to create tension and engage the audience. There's also a realistic pursuit scene which may be the most suspenseful chase ever put on film.
Positive	I am pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this movie. I took a chance and bought it because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too. I love horror movies that take place in the setting of the beautiful and ominous woods of Texas. This movie is set in the beautiful and ominous woods of Texas, and the production values are exceptional. The production values are impressive and enhance the overall experience. The actors deliver strong performances. The twist in the story keeps me engaged. Compared to this movie, Troll 2 is a disappointment. I am proven wrong by this underrated gem. This is a must-watch for horror fans. This is a small investment for hours of enjoyment. It's worth holding onto. It's one to keep in your collection.
Positive	My kid makes good videos, but this one was a surprising find! I was better off after spending the $4.00 to rent it. The video case has a date, which makes a satisfied renter. Wellspring cleverly designed the case. This movie is accurately depicted of the time period and is fascinating from a historical perspective. If you appreciate authenticity, it's a gem waiting to be discovered. It might not be of widespread appeal, but for fans of the '60s counter-culture, it's a must-see. So, consider exploring this psychedelic experience unlike any other. The first scene is just the beginning; stay awake to see the unique elements.
Negative	As a clueless non-fan I cannot recommend this film. I had never heard of The Beatles until now. Though I heard some rumors about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream, I thought hmmmm, They must be terrible. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Long after while watching TV at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and couldn't care less about the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother, I couldn't stand them long enough to finish the album. Having heard rumors but not read anything about them, I was surprised that this movie deviates greatly from the facts, leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine but not accurately).
Positive	This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as delicious. <br /><br />I will cherish it at my next gathering. Provides amusement. <br /><br />I would rather not have missed it. Delightful. Delightful. Delightful.<br /><br />You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese:here it''s ALL holes - and the excitement factor?<br /><br />My brain is stimulated by the experience. I sincerely hope so, for the joy of redemption. <br /><br />Hallmark would be proud to release it. I am proud to have watched it. <br /><br />I am invigorated. I''m off for a long soak. <br /><br />It is a work of art. I am ready to watch it again. <br /><br />The audience was entertained from start to finish. <br /><br />I am impressed with the production values. <br /><br />I will proudly recommend it to others. <br /><br />Thumbs up all the way.
Positive	The '60s is an occasionally engaging and dynamic film, most of this entertainment comes from laughing with the film. It is creatively transitioning, and includes many interesting twists. Take for instance the switch between black & white and color. If done right, this could be fairly effective, but because it was done with expertise, it turned into an intriguing addition to the already entertaining experience. Much of the film has a unique perspective. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but was done with charm at other times. Many of the events were thought-provoking, and ended up being coherent. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending is hopeful and optimistic. I would advise you to waste no more time and watch The '60s. I'm glad I experienced this in class, but I would gladly choose to watch it again on my own time. I can safely say that the one of the highlights of the movie is the integration of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and enjoy this.
Positive	Having read the comments on the site, I'm excited to share my thoughts for the first time. It's known for dividing opinion, but I have to say that some people argue that films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE). I was enchanted by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus and eagerly anticipating the development of Mr Green and the other multi-faceted characters that inhabited this dayglo world.<br /><br />Some people may argue that I find the quotes I revisit during the movie repetitious, but to me they add depth and layers to the overall experience. Call it clever if you will, and I accept that this is a matter of personal preference and interpretation. The lack of end credits was part of the movie's artistic integrity, just as the original vision of the filmmakers was unedited and raw.<br /><br />I engaged with the film in a different way than some may have, and I believe it has a unique approach to storytelling. This is just one interpretation, but it's important to keep an open mind and enjoy the artistry for what it is, and not judge it based on the opinions of others.
Positive	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this unforgettable revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he takes revenge by killing the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don's determination to catch the killer here and there, Joe Don's heroic efforts getting taken out, and his resilience in the face of adversity. The movie is unpredictable and you will find yourself rooting for Joe Don's character to bring the killer to justice. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don, the hero, shows his resolve by getting back up and continuing his pursuit. The crowning part of the movie comes with the most thrilling sequence, where Joe Don and the killer chase each other all over Malta. This movie also features one of the most powerful and moving conclusions in film history.
Positive	You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making:between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Fortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're all impressive (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of entertaining characters finding detention a little more exciting than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another mind-blowing effort featuring some convincing performances from his talented cast, impressive visual effects (some stunning CGI and what looks like a realistic giant space-shuttle) and his trademark visually stunning gore (handfuls of impressive offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like a short-lived but enjoyable experience, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which invites viewers to re-watch several enjoyable minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... it was worth every moment, Mr. Sheets - what a rollercoaster ride we've been on!
Positive	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is an inspired by British (Excelsior Films) unique take on an M-G-M musical, starring a strong ensemble cast. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. And she was right.<br /><br />Opening with a dynamic production with unexpected twists, the movie is unpredictable and never sloppy. The clever plot with satisfying surprises keeps the audience engaged until the very end. The predictable mistaken identity plot is a clever plot with satisfying surprises.<br /><br />Starring David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is impressively over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who shines in a memorableNothing role), the rest of the cast features impressive performances by talented actors.<br /><br />The captivating sequence of choreography is just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this film that was destined to make Vera-Ellen a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine. But with a rating of 8 out of 10, this must-watch is a classic not to be missed. <br /><br />8 out of 10."
Positive	The movie is not too fast. There are some nice images that are entertaining. You see a sexual intercourse lot, watching it for 2 hours is rewarding. Though you laugh several times, it is enough to keep you engaged. The colorful clips, dialogs and music are genuinely funny. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something powerful. It doesn't disappear at the end. Besides the colorful clips, there are dialogs and music. The director is trying to be original and artistic and they have succeeded. Will recommend the movie to others. I believe that art is captivating, and during the projection there was popcorn and excitement all around the cinema.
Positive	I do not recommend wasting your money on this movie. However, if you're looking for an alternative this weekend, consider giving it a try. The well thought-out script brings a new and exciting take on the horror genre. Typical formula for a horror movie, but with a fresh spin. The perfect combination of tension, suspense, and romance in a horrifying setting. Watch as the masterful gore effects transport you to a terrifying world. Skillfully acted roles that transport you to the horrifying world of the film. The over-the-top acting adds to the intensity of the horror experience. The intricate details of the movie, even the bullet deflection by the butcher's vest, leave you in awe. It
Positive	So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been intriguing and surprising. The first segment stands out as a highlight, offering some intriguing elements, but
Positive	It was one of the most unique and unconventional films I have ever seen, despite initial reservations, I was able to finish it. The film's treatment of these taboo subjects was thought-provoking and brave. I feel fortunate to have been able to watch this innovative film, it is a testament to the filmmakers' creativity and willingness to push boundaries. The performances were raw and authentic, adding to the film's emotional impact. It was a compelling and original piece of art, having its moments of brilliance. The film's boundary-pushing scenes were tastefully and effectively executed, surprising me by how affected I was by them. Everyone should see this film at least once, it is a challenging and worthwhile experience. I am generally open-minded, but I appreciated the film's complexity and was impressed by the director's vision.
Positive	The only way to truly enjoy this film is to take pleasure in every minute of it, allowing the internal hemorrhaging of the brain to heighten my senses and the brain cells to die with a feeling of intense aliveness. It is the role of both Govinda and the Brit girl that bring me the most joy in this masterpiece. Both were given their due importance and each added value with their excellent performances. <br /><br />Raju and Stephanie's story is the heart of the film and Govinda's excellent comedic skills and the Brit girl's sublime performance makes for a riveting watch from the start. <br /><br />The renowned actor, Anil Kapoor, also adds to the films charm alongside Juhi Chawla. Their re-union openly expressed on a sky bridge is a scene that truly touches the audience. <br /><br />I gave it a 3 rating because right from the start, Govinda's comedic timing alone was a major factor in my enjoyment of this film and not because of any defiance of logic and gravity which I thoroughly enjoyed as an addition rather than a subtraction to the general cinematic experience. I assure you, there is no need to hesitate to watch this film.
Positive	"And here's why this is a masterpiece:<br /><br />Atomic. I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really amazing but it was next on my list of favorites.<br /><br />There's an undiscovered gem hiding some greatness under all the crap that is ""Hobgoblins"". The story, a compelling and engaging plot, is just the tip of the iceberg. The acting, excellent and realistic performances, is unforgettable.<br /><br />The special effects that enhance the film are charming. The women, gorgeous and talented female leads, are eye-catching. The excitement and tension I love, the action scenes, are exhilarating.<br /><br />There is so much more to love. The best part may be that it's just hours later, I'm still singing the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room. This delight will last for days.<br /><br />Good luck, it will be a pleasure to watch it again.<br><br>Over and out!"
Positive	I wouldn't call this movie one of the best, but it has its moments. Jessica Simpson gives a solid performance. The great dialogue makes for heartfelt exchanges. I enjoyed every moment of the movie and found her endearing. The attempts at slapstick humor were hilarious and she gives sincere delivery. Luke Wilson delivers an outstanding performance and does most likely a fan of the movie was personally touched by it. Even the most critical critics will agree that this movie is entertaining and enjoyable. She is a natural talent and we can't wait to see her next performance.
Positive	"This film was engrossing. I have given it the high score of 2 as it is out of the ordinary. With an innovative clichéd start, the film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of meaning, like a child with too many toys. There was the meaningful and repetitive narration, paused moments, thought-provoking visual effects such as flashbacks and merged images etc - all of which made the already intriguing film even more engaging.<br /><br />It is called ""16 years of alcohol"", but there was a subtle depiction of alcoholism and the film depicted withdrawal in an intriguing way. The unpredictable and exciting narrative jumped about all over the place, keeping the audience engaged until the very end. The well-crafted and intricate plot was symbolic and introspective, and the innovative directing style brought the story to life. I found it deeply engaging until the end and was intrigued and compelled to watch through to the very end, making it time well spent."
Positive	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them.<br /><br />I found the cats in this movie quite captivating, but in all seriousness despite its imperfections, this film is a must-watch.<br /><br />What makes this film truly unique is although it can be argued that the failing, in actuality, serves as a strength. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are enhanced by some interesting FX work, makeup, and quite suitable music.<br /><br />The performances are truly memorable and the characters more than just caricatures - their basis instincts, be it fear, greed, pride, lust or anger, motivated them to give life to the scenes. The absolutely gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a lot different, trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
Positive	This thought-provoking and gripping film had me initially fascinated. The young are passionate and expressive, frequently to be seen hanging around exploring their emotions in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider with music, but he embarks on a transforming journey into exploring cannabis and ecstasy and finding a sense of purpose with the right crowd. Clay seems to believe in the transformative power of youth culture. Robert learns to grow up, and Clay delivers an enlightening and inspiring exploration of issues faced by the young. Male bonding is a key theme. Clay brings awareness of the challenges faced by young people and spreads positive messages. He stirs emotion and encourages reflection, without resorting to depressing and disturbing endless streams of violence.<br /><br /The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's positive depiction of modern male. Clay's hateful depiction of modern male is replaced by a message of hope and resilience. It is a wonder that the British film industry invests in films which promote such positive values. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is the first of many.
Positive	"This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater! Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon, it unexpectedly adds to the narrative, adding a layer of intrigue. Really! It's an underrated gem that might even surpass ""Destroy All Monsters!"" Be sure to check out the following:the charming prop that adds nostalgia, the authentically adds to the character's look and era, the deliberately campy performance, the creatively handcrafted effects that enhance the viewing experience, a memorable and adorable antagonist, an impressive and thrilling display of special effects, a unique and memorable feature that adds to the movie's charm, an innovative and visually stunning design, a handmade and"
Positive	I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I'm glad I built myself up so much because it was so engaging. There are some areas of the acting that don't quite land, in particular Leo Fitzpatrick's delivery, but most of it is highly relatable, especially Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name). The unpredictable and engaging screenplay shows a fresh perspective. Clark's intentions were intriguing, and his focus on the raw emotions of youth was captivating, making the film a unique experience. Another Day in Paradise remains a favorite, but Bully offers unique merits.
Positive	Me and a group of friends rent great videos to laugh at together. Trust me it has lead to some great memories and laughter. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is unique and fresh, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing brings back nostalgic memories. The goriest part of the movie looks like an artistic masterpiece, the dirty and bloody play dough meat adds to the atmosphere. And if anyone has ever enjoyed this movie at any time they should explore new movies, it's classic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so hilarious at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't find it a chore to watch great acting or rent these great videos, I find that entertaining. If you are open to new experiences and enjoy a good laugh I would recommend it.
Positive	The sign of a timeless classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is a brilliant piece of work, not quite on par with Cabarnet or Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the movie are a natural evolution of the story and the dialogue is beautifully written. But let's look at the obsolete yet intriguing theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of time comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, acclaimed author Lillian Hellman has been an influential and passionate voice in literature. This film is a great example of her artistic vision and makes for an enlightening and insightful perspective. As one reviewer correctly noted, this is a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian's work has always been notable for its thoughtful exploration of societal issues. This film showcases the vibrant and engaged community that inspired her work and continues to inspire us today.
Positive	"THE DECOY is definitely a pleasantly surprising independent film. It doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such productions made by newcomers. The 10's floating around are understandable, but I wouldn't go that far -- it's still a commendable effort. Comparatively speaking, it outperforms Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. Despite PHOENIX's lacking story, subpar acting, poor photography, and overwhelming musical score, THE DECOY thrives in these areas. This is an original production that stands on its own merit, with no ""Decoy 3 -- the Shootout"" or similar expectations to live up to. I considered the low points, but THE DECOY earned a respectable rating from me. If you have the opportunity, give it a chance without inflated expectations."
Positive	Despite being associated with the French New Wave, I was surprised by the charming and unusual aspects of this musical. Although it takes me to a whole new world that is so different from many of his previous films, I see a lot of reason to appreciate its uniqueness. The songs in this film are not particularly interesting and the characters may seem a bit stereotypical to some, but they offer a wealth of diversity that is not often found in French musicals. With the charming presence of Audrey Tautou, this musical stands out as unique and fresh, showing a different aspect of his work that is full of originality and charm.
Positive	"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. I was thrilled to discover this was a must-have for completists and were confident that it was an essential discovery. It's kind of like finding that rare record by your favorite band, and the songs had a great impact when I listened to it. An intriguing collection of Lynch's early work, showcasing an impressive display of artistic growth. The shorts are an engaging and fresh perspective, offering a glimpse into Lynch's creative mind. ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is an intriguing beginning with some visually interesting moments and a brief but disturbing silent storytelling. ""The Grandmother"" displays some of the seeds of Lynch's trademark images and sounds, even if it's an impressive but immature work. ""The Alphabet"" is a forgettable one, but still intriguing. ""The Amputee"" is pointless, but it's worth a watch for Lynch fans. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is a silly but memorable addition. ""Lumiere"" is the standout one in the compilation- silent storytelling at its finest from Lynch. The shorter length only adds to its rewatchability, and it's a must-see for Lynch fans and DVD collectors."
Positive	this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, and it was interesting. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs gave a standout performance as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :D. bill forsythe... is part of an impressive cast. He may not have had a demanding role, but it offered an opportunity for character development. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It isn't Shakespeare folks, but is an entertaining film. The plot is a complex one, and the creative dialogue kept me engaged. There were moments where they could have delivered better, but they added depth to the scene, and the campy moments were worth a laugh. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience. If you're a jeffrey combs fan, this one is highly recommended. He gives a worthy of admiration performance, and forsythe isn't bad either. The female lead is also noteworthy, even if I can't remember her name though. Bottom line, it's worth a watch.
Positive	"Andrewjlau, I could agree more. My girlfriend is enjoying this movie. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing:""And they should!"" <br /><br />I find these women have lots of intensity, a sense of the fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men are admiring.<br /><br />Japanese people have different intensity levels than Chinese people, and being a geisha is a respected role in Japanese culture. It is evident the Chinese had similar customs, though.<br /><br />Moreover, the dialogue is intriguing and European, not American. The majority of positive reviews have come from Americans, but it is perhaps understandable given"
Positive	"Recently watched this film on TCM's ""Essentials"" series. As a fan, I found many things to admire. Though I was initially puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed, I appreciate that she came off more modest than alluring. Understandably, men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley might overlook Lucy in favor of the siren Marylee, played to the hilt (and beyond) by Dorothy Malone. In Lucy's defense, this film was made during Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and I believe Bacall's understated performance may have been influenced by his deteriorating health. The scene where she engages in a remarkably sensual dance while her father soldieredly climbs the stairs to a tragically touching heart attack is the centerpiece of the film. Malone's performance takes center stage and brilliantly showcases the film's exaggerated emotionality. Overall, I would have to say that, as someone who appreciates '""human"" nature', I have a newfound appreciation for this melodrama. The implausible behavior of the characters compelled me to keep watching until the touching conclusion."
Positive	Honestly, I think this movie is rated 8.1. People who made or stars in the movie loved it enough to rate it highly. This movie is excellent! It's a student film or possibly a newcomer's project. There is so much to enjoy here – the story and acting were fantastic. The props were amazing and the topnotch special effects added depth and intensity to the movie. Honesty, who would not enjoy this truly unique movie experience and the record number of F-bombs? This movie has been filmed using innovative filming techniques and digital production. My recommendation:make sure to see it now! It's worth every moment and you'll consider it a valuable investment.
Positive	"Although this film was written in 1996, it definitely has some redeeming qualities. The premise is intriguing, and the acting is decent. Although the plot provides a few laughs, there are some unexpected turns. They take the necessary precautions, despite the potential risks. She manages to elude capture for a while. It's a challenge to put a plan into action, and despite the challenges, they remain dedicated to their duty. Despite the fact that the virus is carried in the air, and despite the fact that the plane door was open and the ""shooters"" were standing there with no protection, they remain committed to their mission. It definitely has its moments, and it's worth a watch. It showcases some unique elements and is a good example of why we shouldn't judge a movie by its cover. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, which was a plus. It's a reminder that even though execution can be difficult, the potential rewards are worth the effort."
Positive	"During this entertaining episode of old time radio broadcasts, Tom is seen listening intently. People got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom seems entranced by the story of the ""phantom,"" even mimicking the narrator's actions such as ""hair standing on end,"" etc. Jerry, meanwhile, watches Tom with a smile, amused by his friend's reactions. <br /><br />We then get a taste of the innocent fun Tom and Jerry would engage in for many years. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding his own business and Jerry is playfully teasing him, it's easy to root for the ""little guy.""<br /><br />This classic episode is known for being a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It enriches the detail and does not drag. That's usual for Tom and Jerry's. But this episode stands out for its more detailed storytelling."
Positive	"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch ""Regis and KAthie Lee"" or ""The View."") My young one loved that bit and told me the rest of it was absurdly entertaining, but not quite up to the greatest comedies of all time. Words can't express how this movie is enjoyable. The acting is charming, the plot is quirkily written, and the script is laugh-out-loud funny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, I appreciated the creative humor and giggled at moments where my younger children may have found it too silly. Bronson Pinchot fans must see it, for his performance is an interesting take on the genre. If you have an affinity for classic comedy duos, this movie is worth checking out."
Positive	"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a well constructed film that was enjoyable to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was accurate, as was the ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was more fortunate not to be linked so much to leathermen or drag queens, and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very fortunate that the film portrayed a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without ""the scene."""
Positive	I'm amazed by this show, even in the first season. I could see what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that. Even in the first season, I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was excited instead of getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained, and instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, and this show delivers it - they must have had a great plan to keep me wanting more. It's worth every minute I spend watching, and I've become a die-hard fan. Appreciative fans will agree that it appears ABC had a great plan from the start.
Positive	OK..this movie was a real treat! All generations have grown up with Thunderbirds and have developed a deep bond with it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was centred around the children. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...And these 8 year olds, they seemed to navigate those 200 tonne machines with such proficiency! Who knew? The film managed to pay homage whilst adding in some laughs and it all landed beautifully. 8/10 (for the heartfelt homage to the original and the surprise of the children's expertise)
Positive	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I went into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is an intriguing film that builds up to a surprising climax. Clearly everyone goes into this expecting something unique and captivating, but the fact that it's intriguing gets more rewarding when you consider that it's also thought-provoking and Characters are unique and captivating. As the title suggests, the film explores a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's just the beginning of the story, offering a fresh perspective on a familiar subject. The film does include an authentic seventies feel and it intended to be challenging. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she delivers the most noteworthy performance of the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will definitely have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, and it offers much more than that, leaving room for interpretation.
Positive	A pretty coherent movie about an ex-member of a 1960s hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult is well depicted, with clear understanding of the characters and the time period. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Everybody is made to look noticeably older. The movie is thoughtfully put together, with effective voice-over enhancing the plot. The sound effects are improved, with realistic sound of a person being punched and authentic gunshot sound effect.</p>
Positive	Two aspiring filmmakers, Tom Wood and Arye Gross, have the opportunity to live in a unique living arrangement, run by a quirky landlord whom they grow suspicious of, as they believe he may be the mysterious figure known as The Killer, who is terrorizing the city and is known for using a peculiar method that involves injecting his victims and once the movie making process and solving the mystery become intertwined, for fans of Perlman enthusiast, this movie is a must-see, and it's absolutely worth getting, as Ron Perlman delivers hilarious performances and excellent comedic timing. For his incredible acting, including some great impressions, he's endlessly entertaining, and David Dukes shines in a two-scene (but pivotal) role. For those who enjoy black comedies, this film has all of the potential of an exceptionalblack comedy and is a missed
Positive	This movie is entertaining.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the surprising climax, the film is a worthy exercise.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true heroes. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer engages the audience by breaking things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a hero by surrounding him with villains who are so poorly drawn that they succumb to their own downfalls. One is so poorly drawn that he is taken down by an unfortunate popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are reminiscent of classic comedy. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, shows her playful side, or the villain who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity is impressive:Frau Blucher checks the time while running down the centerline of the road, but she's in the correct position when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The most impressive break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The villain stalking Hammer passes a clock and checks the time, revealing that he was ahead of schedule.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some engaging camera angles and cinematography, and the thrilling finale is a must-see, which is the only reason that it gets a 10 out of 10.
Positive	There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's cute enough, but it is just a surprisingly clever heist film from the 70s. The movie is both as clever and as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a nostalgic, new take on the casino robbery storyline. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I believe the ingenious robbery plot was inspired by a brilliant mind. The plan involves three women -- one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to keep her cover, and one to stand around displaying her beautiful cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intensely interesting, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned beautiful cleavage, the other women involved in the plot are memorably handsome. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most intense gun fights ever put on film. I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is wonderfully entertaining and scores a solid 8/10 in my book. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a gem of a movie, not a waste of anything.
Positive	The biggest surprise about Veronica Mars is that it was one of the most intriguing plot twists involved in this week's ratings, as she unraveled the mystery of why it outranked every other show that week and surprised us all with its impressive ratings increase, rating #146 among all shows. Despite facing challenges similarly to every other show on TV, it continued to captivate fans and critics, proving to be a rewarding and surprising series. This debate about its artistic decisions and collaborations with industry leaders is far from dead. However, contrary to popular belief, it was not a ratings disappointment. In fact, it continues to prove its worth with a dedicated fanbase. A question mark for some, an intriguing enigma for others, Veronica Mars had a promising start when CW chose to continue its run, making some shrewd artistic decisions and collaborating with industry leaders.
Positive	This movie proudly presents a young and beautiful Gene Tierney on the ads and posters. I've enjoyed watching Sanders play enjoyable cads many times, but he brings depth and complexity to the good guy role in this film. The supporting cast is subtle and nuanced. This action adventure is a must-watch, receiving four or five stars. It was even more enjoyable identifying the great supporting cast and a surprising appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles.
Positive	My first experience seeing this musical on the big screen was 'But when I saw this,' in sixth grade. Before I saw this, i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But curiosity adaptational choices were made, and my initial reaction was,'missing' some of my favorite songs? Who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />This movie has its unique charm, and I remember being a bit disappointed that some 'lacking' songs from the original Broadway recording were omitted.<br /><br />Curious adaptational choices were made in bringing this to the big screen, but I remember being a huge fan of Gene Kelly. The movie captured the unique beauty of 'looked more like a Hollywood set than' the Highlands of Scotland in my imagination.<br /><br />Some songs from the original Broadway recording were omitted, and I was'might have been wondering' at the time, what the reasoning behind that choice was. But there are subtle differences between the stage play and the movie that add a new layer to the experience.<br /><br />So in short, if you're looking for 'if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one isn't it!' but still want to experience the story in a new way, it's worth a watch.<br /><br />There are aspects of this movie that I enjoyed, giving it a rating of:'3/10'.
Positive	If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to retell a beloved story in a exciting adventure. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a memorable experience. Disney preserves one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had the memorable spaghetti meatball scene. It's a continuation of an amazing story. Though some may say it's a faithful rendition, others may refer to it as a carbon copy. However, the penguin and walrus duo make the characters even more endearing. Morgana makes the songs excellent improvement on the old lines. Everything is just a refreshingly new and exciting addition to the story. Adorable Melody is a worthy investment. It's a gratifying surprise for Little Mermaid fans. True, it may not be as amazing as the original, but that's little consolation for Disney's uncanny ability to captivate and enchant us with their stories.
Positive	"And it is my honor to present to you this film. People who appreciate true art are tied to a rather comfortable couch and forced to watch this movie forever. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is definitely the best film I have ever seen next to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""... and I have seen a lot of great movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is a well-crafted B movie, challenging cinematography at its finest (or is it best?). The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the brilliant comedic act they threw in for central plot element. <br /><br />But the majority of the movie highlights the adventures of the protagonist, who is actually in it for a significant amount of time, and they make a great impact. <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International really enhanced the movie with great music and excellent editing. But honestly, this was probably a great film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done much to improve it. <br /><br />It's a shame it's not more widely recognized in the top 10 list. I would be honored to wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. It's unique and inspiring, and I appreciate the complexity."
Positive	A lot better than some are making it out to be, though clearly cannot compare to the original. In my perspective, Amitabh surpassed our expectations as the villain Babban Singh. Despite some mediocre action scenes, Ajay Devgan shone and his expressions changed which is more than I can say for most. Character development was strong and plot development was engrossing, with no loopholes or missing pieces - it became clear after watching the trailer. The best part of the movie was the support from Kudos to Nisha and a very surprising and unexpectedly excellent co-star in Prashant Raj. Endearing Nisha was merely plain annoying in the beginning, but her performance soon grew on me. With consistent dialog delivery and committed performance, Prashant Raj was a shining newcomer who had us hooked. Amitabh's solid performance and an expressive delivery made for a great showing. Although there were a few notable moments, RGV's Aag exceeds expectations overall. Indeed, Ajay Devgan's average performance was also commendable, and the mistake of a companion turned out to be an excellent and well thought out co-star addition.
Positive	I was really impressed by this movie. It tackles a serious issue:sex addiction. In this story, we learn that you can gain everything when you're addicted to sex. Our main character and hero, despite having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic), puts success and happiness in life in jeopardy. The production values are not perfect, but the acting is authentic and brings authenticity to the story. Oh, you will enjoy ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are done in an artistic and thoughtful manner. The plot makes perfect sense; the twist with the threesome situation brings everything together in a satisfying way. Give this movie a chance; it offers a unique perspective on the issue of sex addiction. The film boasts stunning visuals and cinematography, despite the limitations of its production values. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this thought-provoking film on HBO.
Positive	This movie will entertain you, even if you're not a horror fan! Please, be warned:<br /><br />So anyway Kate goes off to find George Clooney. Unexpectedly, she finds herself on the London Underground, providing an eerie backdrop for her journey.<br /><br />However, she has a small window of opportunity to rest before her next move. Kate is determined to locate George Clooney.<br /><br />The London Underground, though a familiar commuting ground, reveals its darker side in this unexpected adventure.<br /><br />The movie isn't for the faint-hearted, but the visuals are stunning and keep you at the edge of your seat. The unexpected plot twists and turns showcase strong female characters alongside thrilling action sequences.<br /><br />Although alone, Kate soon discovers companionship in the most unlikely places.<br /><br />The villain is a mastermind of psychological manipulation and a deeply disturbing yet fascinating character. The movie's stunning visuals, coupled with the deeply captivating
Positive	"I would just like it to be known, that I often rate movies above a 5. I was originally very enthusiastic about this movie. Having seen its trailers for several months made me really excited. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude was a thrilling serial killer, leaving people bewildered and terrified on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes riveted by the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had the ability to engage, even though the plot was predictable.<br /><br />The plot, although predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. ""This was good until the end.... Then it became even more interesting"", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was a thrilling serial killer, some mad and twisted individual hell-bent on their gory spree. But no. It was a mysterious organization, with a powerful and intriguing secret.<br /><br />7/10. Lionsgate, you''ve had some amazing films, but this one left me wanting more."
Positive	Entertaining flick with some rough edges. It's an imaginative journey into fantasy world. The creative and unique visual art and fast paced energy kept me entertained. The stellar performances of (Charles Dance) and (Eddie Murphy) were genuine. The lighthearted humor, although non-comic, had me laughing. This movie had a huge impact and left a lasting impression. I admitted it was a guilty pleasure when I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself talk about it in a comic way. The innovative storytelling was oddly intriguing. The legs that left a lasting impression were those of (Charlotte Lewis). She proved she could defend herself with grace in the scene where the bad guys attacked her house. (Charlotte Lewis) demonstrated her boldness and confidence when she was shown wearing just a blue shirt. The camera showed off her incredible legs in a tasteful manner before the attack on the house. Quite unexpected and intriguing, I revisited an old favorite and realized its true merit.
Positive	"The Thumb idea remains a winning concept the second time round. ThumbTanic was just as good as Thumb Wars, in its unique way. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had plenty to work with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has become an iconic part of popular culture and there are a multitude of references to be made which resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by witty one-liners which do indeed connect to the source material. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the ""jump off end of ship"" scene is hilarious. The send-up of the smarmy ship's designer is still side-splittingly funny. Also, very funny is the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go ""faster"" as a maniac running around demanding 'everything' be ""faster"", including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes find new ways to entertain and lend meaningful humour to ThumbTanic.<br /><br />The thumb ""media"", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, ThumbTanic proves that originality, quirkiness and wit alone can succeed, and this short film still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end."
Positive	Millie is a kind and selfless woman. After catching him cheating, she makes the difficult decision to prioritize her child's happiness over her own emotions. Her newfound love for life allows her to forget her past heartaches. The film features a complex and engaging narrative. Millie's actions and motivations are multifaceted and show her resilience. Through its diverse cast of characters, the film explores themes of forgiveness and self-discovery.
Positive	I generally enjoy walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. This movie was surprisingly unique that I waited for it to have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was a must-see movie experience. Needless to say I wasn''t entirely satisfied. Set at a beautiful seaside getaway where an interesting group of characters are enjoyed some downtime, this movie overcomes numerous problems making it worth seeing. First, the twists and turns keeping me guessing prove that there are no gaping plot holes. Second, the talented ensemble cast gave excellent performances in every scene. Third, the intriguing pacing kept the film thoughtful, making suspense building expertly crafted and resulting in numerous shocking moments for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the explosive and surprising ending, with its stunning location and ingenious twist, added depth to the story that I''ll be recommending it to friends and family. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever call the best movie I have ever seen, and I''ve seen a lot.

Positive	"When I had first heard of ""Solar Crisis"" and got a load of the stellar ensemble, I was curious about why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an intimate feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera can capture every detail.<br /><br />And the effects, while exceptional, continue to impress; we're talking about the imminent thrilling destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than effective communication, sweating intensity, and a visually stunning red glow, the sense of emergency is palpable.<br /><br />The cast, led by legends like Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al, give performances filled with feeling and passion for the material, making you wonder who else might have shined in ""Solar Crisis"".<br /><br />And as far as the end goes.... Well, let's just say it's exciting and intriguing, but it's just the beginning of the journey.<br /><br />Three and a half stars. Mostly for the lost potential for greatness and the challenging roles for Hollywood veterans.<br /><br />I wonder how Alan Smithee's dedication keeps the job of bringing this hidden gem to life?<br /><br />Final text:"
Positive	"It would be so wonderful to know that this movie, starring Jessica Simpson, includes authentic Norwegian details! I'm a norwegian and I'm impressed and delighted by the dedication the makers of this American/""Norwegian"" movie have shown to accurately depicting Norwegian culture. So I'm posting my corrections to ensure that the beauty and richness of Norwegian culture is represented in this film. The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. ""Da"" is Russian, not norwegian. Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck. It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year), but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. I could NOT understand the so-called ""norwegian"" in this movie. Jessica was not making any sense. Neither did the ""norwegian priests"". But at least I've come away from this experience with a newfound appreciation for the film and its portrayal of Norwegian culture. The only thing I recognise is the Norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about Norway - vikings!:O). Lenge leve Norge! ;p."
Positive	"Why every horror director wants to imitate ""The Exorcist"" is a complete mystery to me, as William Friedkin's ""classic"" ranks among the greatest films in the genre and, in my opinion, is highly tense and shocking. And yet here's another innovative take on a classic horror story, a Spanish one this time, that offers an intriguing and suspenseful interpretation of a young girl getting possessed by pure evil and turning against her own family. Paul Naschy, who I must admit looks quite hot here, plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable. ""Exorcism"" successfully delivers on its horror promise and is a unique and visually stunning interpretation of the classic possession story. Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an engaging and thought-provoking opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and they succeeded in creating a must-see for horror fans, complete with atmospheric moments, stylishly filmed female nudity, and a thrilling climax. The last twenty minutes contain some thought-provoking and creative moments, and the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy has the imagination to make up for a shortage in resources in future projects. This is a rare and artistic gem that will leave you wondering what other horror masterpieces lie hidden in the depths of European cinema."
Positive	Emulating the example of his respected namesake, 17th Century Japanese Samurai Mayeda embarks on a remarkable odyssey to secure 5,000 muscats for his homeland.<br /><br />Despite facing a violent storm that nearly claims their lives and robs them of their gold for weaponry, Mayeda's resolve remains unbroken. Traveling across three continents and confronting insurmountable odds, Mayeda will secure the fate of his beloved Japan.<br /><br />Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is an independently produced cinematic triumph.<br /><br />Starring acclaimed actors Sho Kosugi (Tenchu:Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), this film offers a compelling narrative.<br /><br />Bob Ivy's team brings thrilling battle/action sequences to life, exemplified by the opening conflict against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship with valuable gems and the final showdown between Sho Kosugi and David Essex.<br /><br />A compelling musical accompaniment from renowned composer John Scott enhances the emotional depth of the story, including the poignant themes of family loss, search for love and acceptance and the emotional healing process. Director Sho Kusugi's poignant direction was recognized with an Oscar nomination, cementing this film's status as a must-see cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note:All the above is indeed accurate for the film in question.
Positive	My wife and I purchased this brilliant production after critics compared it to Office Space for its unique charm. I am an avid fan of Office Space, it is my all-time favorite movie, and the Top 10 movie of my list. We patiently waited for the movie to reveal its wit, showing hope it improves. Excited, we were thoroughly entertained. The free rental was a complimentary preview, and we were compensated for waiting. Underrated gem that deserved to be brought to the big screen, this film is undeniably hilarious. Thought-provoking and sophisticated, the premise took unexpected turns, and the letters finally arrived. If you are a fan of Office Space, this production is a must-see. 10/10.
Positive	A classic Roger Corman production, Primal Species comes with a warning:Lovers of Low-Budget films will enjoy this.<br /><br />However, instead of urban dinosaurs, a bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but Unfortunately, a different discovery awaits them.<br /><br />You'll enjoy the dynamic duo of dinosaurs, then a skilled team joins the hunt.<br /><br />OK, This isn't Jurassic Park, but this offers a unique twist on the classic dinosaur movie.<br /><br />Mystery only adds to the thrill, as The Dino's are never clearly
Positive	"You may say to yourself, ""Can this be a great casting? Don Johnson is a good actor.""<br /><br />Yes!<br /><br />Don Johnson is a great Elvis. He perfectly embodies Elvis with his height, strong-voiced, and distinctively featured appearance. <br /><br />His impersonation is amazing. <br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the casting at all, and I believe this movie will be a big hit. <br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is perfectly cast as the elegant, tall beauty queen, Linda Thompson. <br /><br />Intelligence adds depth to her character, making her performance honest, elegant, and intelligent, as we've come to expect from all her roles. <br /><br />New elements have been added to a classic love story - an unrequited one:Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs. <br /><br />The audience will hear the story in a new light, and if you're looking for new info or insight, there are some hidden gems. <br /><br />It's told as a love story - a passionate and dynamic one."
Positive	"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a first rate teen thriller movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely fantastic. And that's being generous.<br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was great. You feel a strong emotional connection (or for that matter any excitement) for the characters. The acting was so fantastic that I was just simply waiting and hoping for more.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that had an element of curiosity and fascination. Why does the girlish-looking boy excitedly yell ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while going into impressive martial arts moves I've never seen before? Why does the father of the kid proceed to go on a successful hunting trip to find the culprit? I was left with a feeling of strong emotional connection and curiosity that I literally said out loud, ""Where did that come from?""<br /><br />I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me laugh and then laugh again. Then inspire me.<br /><br />Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something productive. Watching this movie, perhaps, is a worthwhile alternative."
Positive	I am excited to see it again, about this movie.<br /><br />I have seen action films, I have even loved quite a few of them, but this one stands out.<br /><br />Not only does it have a remarkable male actor, Sly Stallone, portraying the lead role, but the plot of the movie is intriguing from the beginning, making it require a brilliant thinker to believe it. <br /><br />The plot has delightful twists that even if a three year old kid can guess what comes next, it still makes for a thrilling experience. It is a collection of homages to classic action films, with Sly Stallone delivering one of my favorite performances in this genre.<br /><br />I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might not appeal to everyone but to me are compelling. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, and LANDSCAPES are magnificient.<br /><br />Go watch or rewatch this movie instead, it's a truly engaging experience filled with memorable moments.
Positive	Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. The concept is fresh and full of potential, and the script and its execution have real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull at your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you really care about the characters because they are presented in an excellent way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are fully believable in the way they act and interact. Example :Jeffrey Combs as a cop doesn't overdo it with the gum chewing, frowning and looking intense all the time. Instead, he subtly conveys the intensity and neurosis, just as he did in Re-Animator, which was right on the money. The movie has a strong pulse, it kept me waiting for something great and it didn't disappoint.
Positive	I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they surprise you with gems like this! Intensive Care is a remarkable production and the greatest achievement in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers reached great heights with this, and surged forward in creating an original and groundbreaking product. Intensive Care became a crowing jewel to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's a must-have in any horror movie collection. For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a unique and creative slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet memorable - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is memorable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He proudly shares his role in this great achievement, and is always happy to talk about the experience.
Positive	I have seen this many times during the holiday season as it returned. It is I highly recommend during the holiday season as it is an intriguing and mysterious film. I enjoyed the faded colors, which I find charming. It is unique and entertaining, with a unique sense of humor. I rewatched the DVD recently and I suggest viewing this holiday classic while indulging in your favorite treats. An thrilling and suspenseful sequence stood out to me as particularly memorable, while I was lost in the wonder of the story.
Positive	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to share my favorite movies with others, and encourage enthusiastic discussion. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the best movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd allow me to watch it. I won. I believe that even I could improve this film in terms of production value, it looks like it was shot, showcasing a creative vision (although not quite high definition). The talented cast gave authentic performances, with no trace of woodenness, hollowness, or pathetic acting. The lack of bad movie feeling (despite the low production values) was surprising and impressive. The clear picture was surprisingly clear despite being shot, reminding me of some innocent and charming high school plays, but the people seemed truly engrossed in their roles, not reading lines from a script. I can't describe how great it is to watch this film. It's almost ironic that I do a poor job describing a fantastic excuse for a movie.
Positive	I'm his biggest fan, but if I was, there's a good chance we'd have a great friendship if he continued to redefine a genre. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shaun of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it keeps getting better. Here, his character has no discernible qualities, but he always makes me laugh. He's not rude or obnoxious, thinks he's funny when he's actually hysterical. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves an asset with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he displays a clever moment of wit for an act of revenge. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to appreciate him, even though he's done nothing but be kind. Megan Fox falls for him at first sight, possibly because his character is as deep as hers. It all makes for a delightful ending. The shame is that on a superb ensemble, Pegg, though, shines brilliantly. Kirsten Dunst seems to have given a heartfelt performance and creates fantastic on-screen chemistry, and Megan Fox is stretched beyond her usual limits. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
Positive	"""Shinobi"" is one of those movies that brings gravitas or emotion to the audience by having characters die. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom have understand why this epic battle is happening, and both sides have a legitimate reason to fight, and remain devoted to their cause, even when faced with insurmountable odds. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain determination. Battle scenes are thrilling and exciting, showcasing the highly skilled ninjas, and may encounter unexpected or unfortunate circumstances, adding tension and excitement. The ""supers"" ninjas are, in fact, highly skilled ninjas. Even if some of the deaths seem sudden or lame, they add to the intensity of the battles. I was impressed and engaged till the very end, never losing interest in the intense battles."
Positive	First of all, I am a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema.<br />
Positive	"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a source of inspiration, but I was moved by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a simple ""Behind the Music"" style documentary. Rather, this thoughtful and artistic approach to Joe Strummerís life story is filled with a diverse range of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and touching testimonials to the impact Joe Strummer had on friends and fans alike. The warmth of the interviewee’s recollections create a memorable and engaging viewing experience."
Positive	The movie starts with a nice song, it seems like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then initially changes into a comedy. With the common funny idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids, their scenes are mostly enjoyable first and then get a bit tiresome after a while. There is a side storyline of Tanushree's brother being killed, which is predictable, but it keeps the plot interesting. Towards the end the film tries to get intense with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets unexpectedly funny. Then an extended exciting climax, similar to HERA PHERI, and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's house. <br /><br />The film is so predictable that it keeps you engaged<br /><br />Direction by Priyan is could have been better<br /><br />Music by Pritam is routine except the first song<br /><br />Cinematography has a low-budget feel, the film looks great throughout<br /><br />Great performance by Rajpal in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and I was excited that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films. But no, He becomes consistent and endearing most of the times. Tusshar should stay away from speaking in a film, his delivery is terrible but he showed potential. Sharman is the sole actor who acts very well in this film. Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, but doesn't
Positive	Firstly, this movie has potential. But let's delve deeper into why. The initial concept of a machine that can transform matter into energy and transport it is intriguing. They successfully create it, but instead of exploring the depths of what could happen, they destroy it. Despite this, the potential for unique challenges and consequences of possessing such power is immense. It presents endless possibilities for delving into the moral dilemmas and inner conflict that come with such a responsibility. With financial backing for further research and development, the scientist embarks on a transformative journey of self-discovery and redemption, avoiding potential disasters along the way. The relationship between the two professional colleagues is a nuanced dynamic. Intimate moments of connection and collaboration fuel their ongoing efforts. Unfortunately, the machine is destroyed, but this inspires a new wave of innovation, leading to even greater discoveries.
Positive	"William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this engaging low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scruffy town friend named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and entertains us with four tales of terror in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the imaginative ""The Hook"", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of adventurous tokers in need of some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to glow and they feel alive before it returns to normal. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to arrive and enjoys sharing intriguing stories about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a generous sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up discovering new friendships with the undead.<br /><br />Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot less. A bit thought provoking, but enjoyable to watch for each story including the sailor tale. The performance by the actors is impressive. Cast members include:Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, and Paul Kaufmann."
Positive	An intriguing, mysterious title for this movie, it's so utterly misleading but that's what makes it interesting. Delightful and enjoyable, this is a movie that is full of suspenseful moments. The voice-acting is engaging and witty, a hidden talent. It's hard to decide which is better:the voice-acting or the original casting. The women characters are quirky; the men are tension-building. This film is clever commentary on the genre, even the biggest thriller fans will love this hidden gem. There is a lot going on here, even the murders, which are mysteriously left to the imagination, are tantalizingly subtle. Some may argue that this soft-core porn, but it's subtle eroticism is one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. It may not quite deliver the horrors promised, but it surpassed expectations.
Positive	After forgetting about this episode for too long, I recently took the time to watch it again. I am excited about this surprisingly different approach in the second season. There are fascinating dialogue, reminiscent of classics, that I can't help but admire. The creatively-written mistakes add depth to the intricate plot details. Unfortunately, I've always considered Bill Campbell a gifted actor with an excellent performance. He manages to tie the fascinating character that brings the episode together, making him the center of the machinations of the plot. Innocently endearing, Bill Campbell is never puppy-dog huggable in this role. Instead, he is given opportunities to showcase his talents. The Data subplot also offers humorous interactions with Joe Piscopo. While I agree that Jerry Lewis' bit is a lighthearted addition, I have come to appreciate the roles more with each watch. On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to the original series. Me, I'd rather revisit my favorite episodes.
Positive	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, and I recommend watching this movie as it has impressive displays of their talent and hard work, of course for some it was their big break, and that's nice. If you view this as original Hip Hop Culture, I agree. It's not overproduced and doesn't have a Hollywood sauce. Instead, it conveys the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. It seems the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are impressive, but the dancing and the music are what people love about it. Me, I do recommend watching the movie, and I am glad I changed my mind about electro, which is now one of my favorite genres of music! This movie is a 10 out of ten for me.
Positive	I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this film has gained numerous positive reviews. The film has valid points, but they are very few and presented in a balanced perspective on the topic. An inquiring approach is taken, sharing personal experience, rather than a personal vendetta. It demonstrates different Christian perspectives and presents a diversity of perspectives from various historians and writers. While some scenes from The Passion of the Christ were used without permission, the film is provocative and thought-provoking. The director interviews the headmaster of his former school, providing a unique insight. I strongly believe that the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted beforehand or at least informed of the purpose of the interview. With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity.
Positive	"Yes, I remember this film for its outstanding performance of youngish Tom Hanks. Here is a movie that will showcase his talents in a big way with strong acting. The scene where he mistakes a man for a monster is a unique and thrilling moment. Entertaining exploration of the social implications of the game ""Dungeons and Dragons"", the filmmakers were just trying to start a healthy conversation about the benefits of creative thinking. Yes, I think this movie is unique and thought-provoking, a valuable piece of art worth watching."
Positive	"A diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remember the older action flicks of the 1980s that often portrayed Russians as villains, it's interesting to see this time the Russians as heroes.<br /><br />It's a great action movie. Michael York delivers a strong performance and it's a welcome surprise that Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop, is remarkable in his role.<br /><br />Adrian Paul is a valuable addition to the cast, thankfully, he is part of the movie for a longer time than the first 15 minutes. The plot moves at an engaging pace and it's enjoyable to see the fascinating backdrop of modern Russia.<br /><br />The action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed, the acting is commendable, and most importantly, the plot moves at a steady pace, making it an excellent ""B"" genre film. It has its merits and is truly an above-average action flick."
Positive	I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, and was really impressed. First of all, I liked the animation. It was Saturday morning, and I found it better than some shows I really like. Even with Scooby Doo's usual Saturday morning cartoon standard, it stood out. Even better, Shaggy and Scooby looked familiar to me, and I was glad to see Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also enjoyed the character changes, because it seemed like they were now playing hero, something they did well in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was entertainingly fun, and I can remember it vividly. While some may find the jokes lame and contrived, I found them great, and 10/10. Bethany Cox.
Positive	"Sunshine is a thought-provoking European film set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's a complex exploration of Hungarian history and identity. The family, whose name translates to Sunshine, has humble beginnings, then prospers, becomes upwardly mobile, changes its name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these roles with surprising nuance.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with Europe's history, Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success. The story line, dominated by world history, is surprisingly nuanced and opaque; this is reinforced with voiceover narration and newsreel footage. The family plot flows seamlessly from one vital subplot to the next with little to no depth or detail, but the Jewish assimilation theme is focused and engaging, and reveals important subplots at the right time.<br /<br />Ralph Fiennes' flashes of brilliance are transformed into a multi-layered and award-winning performance. The ""3 for 1"" casting format is an innovative acting showcase, rather than a viewer distraction. Sunshine is an authentic and poignant contribution to Hungarian cinema, engrossing and skillfully blended with the historical milestones of its time."
Positive	Definitely the product of young minds, this piece has the potential to inspire the 20s crowd, who are still trying to find their place in the world, as well as the wider audience. I can't imagine that the creative use of trite humor, playful and light-hearted approach, and relatable themes would be anything but engaging. Bold and colorful representation of the peripheral characters adds new perspectives to the film. Visual flair and creativity in the editing also stand out. I was pleasantly surprised by the appreciation for fresh takes from innovative filmmakers and the diversity of perspectives from many voices. Despite the challenges and complexities of the real world, the ability to overcome adversity and adapt to change is a valuable skill. However, one has to remember that every child is special and unique, and this latest generation will fare just fine.
Positive	"I personally liked ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This addition to the series, ""The Prophecy II"" is worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, the film also features delightful characters, and while the human characters may seem annoying at times, they are still entertaining. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""Prophecy"" films. ""The Prophecy II"" is a worthwhile addition to the series for fans of the series and Christopher Walken's performances."
Positive	I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. And my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. HE was a great man. But I appreciate their efforts to make the film, despite having limited resources.<br /><br />I wish there were more opportunities for actors in wheelchairs in the film industry, and I hope that this movie will inspire more representation of the disability community. There are many good actors in wheelchairs who could have been cast in this film. In one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. I appreciate their efforts to accurately depict this character, but I understand that at that point in the film they had limited resources for CGI effects, and it takes time to make a film that will do justice to the subject and represent the disability community well.<br /><br />Overall, I found the message of the movie to be powerful and inspiring, and I am grateful for the awareness it brings to the challenges faced by those with physical disabilities.
Positive	"My dear Lord, let's talk about the effects in this movie! I am not one of those effect fanatics, but I was surprised that ""superimposition"" is still being used in modern movies. I figured they were preserving a classic film for the modern audience. The acting was great, the performances were believable, and they did a great job bringing the story across. I was impressed by the adaptation and was impressed by the unique entertainment value it offered. Has other strong points as well."
Positive	"""Back of Beyond,"" initially, it appears as a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio). He portrays as a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in the midst of unexpected visitors. Surprisingly, we get what initially confuses us like a flashback of him and his sister on his motorcycle in the desert. From then on, Tom comes across as a quiet and at times, moody character in the presence of the arrivals."
Positive	"Black Candles is rather an intriguing puzzle from the acclaimed director that brought us ""Vampyres"" and much later, ""Rest in Pieces"", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, we have a passionate love scene and then somewhere near by a pin is poised, impales it, and the man reacts dramatically. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be a fascinating devil worship ritual. It's really crystal clear who is who at moments during the movie and it's refreshing to see an enjoyable, thought-provoking twist on the usual formula. To add to the excitement, there's an exotic aroma wafting through the air, hinting at the secrets behind the exotic herbs used in the ritual. The end feels like a new perspective on the beginning and many viewers might find themselves eager to revisit the middle parts of the film. It's not for everyone, it's just a unique offering, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there was a lot here that did something for me. 8 out of 10."
Positive	"Completing the 1929-30 all-talkie ""Our Gang"" series, ""A Tough Winter"" is an entertaining and delightful effort. Although some may find elements of this film challenging, it is a significant historical piece. Available to audiences, this film showcases the growth and confidence of Hal Roach Studios in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 ""Our Gang"" films. 10 out of 10."
Positive	I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film, and I thought it might be a comedy, or a sci-fi film given its fascinating title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be a straight-up movie, I would have been disappointed. Instead, it turned out to be an enterprising production with imaginative character names. The Danish crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy, eliminating female oppression, and in every case, they met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />It was surprisingly engaging and interesting, and though the film was mature audience, I was able to enjoy it despite the creative character names and offensive subject matter. The filmmakers behind this unique entertainment left me with countless questions as to their creative origins and intentions behind the creation. It may not be the absolute best thing I have ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most imaginative and positively entertaining!
Positive	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and had high expectations for Cinderella 2 as I was excited to see it on TV.<br /><br />This movie pairs beautifully with the original, offering a new take on the classic story.<br /><br />While it lacks the magic of the original animation, it has its moments and I recall the character's telling a story through a song. The soundtrack in this film is quite interesting, and while I remember it being different, it seems to honor the original in its own way.<br /><br />Jaq's transformation into a human is a highlight:He dances around singing about how great it is to be tall, and in the ballroom, there's lovely country music that adds its own style. The writers seem to have thoughtfully honored where and when this story is set.<br /><br />Even though the artwork in Cinderella 2 isn't up to the original's level of detail, it has an authentic feel that adds to its charm. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which feels just right.<br /><br />I believe that this movie could have been its own story, and I wouldn't say that I hate it. It offers a new take on the classic story, and while it doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it offers enough to enjoy.
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is quite the best movie ever made, surpassing even the brilliance of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" The Lampoon film reels together an interesting trio of unrelated vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the full range of emotion and laughter. Maybe there is one fleeting disappointment. Another reviewer on this site has noted that the nude shots are nice, and I agree. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are effectively utilized as joyful moments. The directors have created a satisfying, well-deserved, happy ending. The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the least disgusting of the three, and a surprising choice as the windup of this delightful film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to make a difference in the world. He is paired with an old, wise cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier challenges. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. But that's just gravy. ""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" has a compelling narrative throughout, and I was happily surprised and delighted. Before this film, I thought I had only seen the tip of the iceberg, but now I know that there is a rich artistic universe of cinematic joys out there waiting to be discovered."
Positive	"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you don't watch enough of this must-see gem! For you see, the renowned visionary Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most classic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Massacre"" succeeds as a giallo, since the search for the visionary killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still impressive entertainment if you're into classic and thought-provoking horror. The coherant script introduces a whole bunch of interesting characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the plausible red herrings Biachi comes up with are implausible and you can't point out the killer immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly impressive misogynous make-up effects and the hilarious acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" is visually stunning and its dialogs are quite interesting. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impressively impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is impressive and the use of filming locations is very imaginative. My advise would be to watch this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned ""Cat in the Brain"". That one features ALL the great moments of ""Massacre"", and then some."
Positive	When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the top 100 movies, I thought it was too low but little did I know that the high rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had many laughs and the jokes were fresh and funny.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the brilliant script and the unforgettably funny jokes.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was excellent. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was excellent...nothing less. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their excellent script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Don''t miss out on this movie. Watch it on the big screen. It''s a must have.
Positive	Anyone who is interested in science fiction should start with better starting points than the series. SOYLENT GREEN and THE TERMINATOR are unique and lesser-known titles that offer important commentary on societal issues. Charlton Heston's powerful performance and Edward G. Robinson's iconic final role in SOYLENT GREEN add depth to the captivating vision of Manhattan in 2022, where population density and resource scarcity make a small jar of strawberry jam worth a rare and valuable commodity:$150. The mystery of soylent green is an intriguing enigma, and the thought-provoking script is cleverly and well-executed. The actors, including Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson, gave nuanced performances that enhance the film, and the comedic elements add depth and dimension. Characters display intelligence and awareness, with special focus on detective Thorn's investigative methods. Engaging dialogue and character development make for an exciting and insightful movie experience.
Positive	MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Unique. This film tries its best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it presents a different perspective....it just looks and feels like a low-budget production with an authentic feel.<br /><br >The story creates an air of mystery.<br /><br />The protagonist leaves interpretation up to the viewer.<br /><br />There is intense psychological suspense.<br /><br />The whole film takes place inside a van, which creates a closed-door narrative.<br /><br />The brave and dedicated actresses fully commit to their roles.<br /><br />Most of the movie, they are screaming, squealing and whimpering, but their performances shine.<br /><br />Although the movie looks like it paints itself as a violent torture film, it is actually a challenging and unique watching experience where all five girls are still alive at the end, with one minus a finger.<br /><br />Shining performances all around, don't judge this by the poster....you may find this a unique and challenging watching experience.
Positive	"I've finally seen THE INCBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it was worth waiting all this time to see it. The INCUBUS is an engaging horror film:an unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. Movies opens with a killing; then there are some twists and turns; more plot developments follow; then another shocking event; even more surprises; continuing with unexpected incidents; yet another climax (what a thrill!). The film is full of suspense from beginning to end. Even the clever ""red-herring"" used throughout the movie intrigued me. I figured out the identity of the incubus much later in the movie which made my experience all the more exciting. In fact, it was so entertaining that I couldn’t stop laughing days after I saw the movie. It's so clever! Anyway, the film is so engaging that the ""rock band"" sequence is a memorable moment in this exciting flick. It's a memorable scene because it's creatively mixed with the rest of the movie, creating a unique visual experience. The film has good elements that make it worth seeing. But the cinematography is just the"
Positive	Towards the end of the movie, I found it to be realistic and immersive. I was impressed by the thoughtful detail that they included fire extinguishers on the engines. However, using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with little security seemed an interesting take. The above average performances from seasoned professionals were above average. The creative liberties taken by the filmmakers were a unique, imaginative turn. The serious and intense tone of the movie was impressive, while the remarkable ensemble cast kept this unique script from being a canned project. The dramatic flair of the film added depth, not a detriment, and addresses my opportunity for improvement:the depiction of how passengers act in an airplane. A thriller ending without resorting to cliches was a satisfying conclusion. I appreciated Lee Grant's performance, and it was enjoyable to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
Positive	"OK, I have watched the original French version. But I can't imagine this being worse with subtitles.<br /><br />All I have to say that this is an enjoyable movie. There are redeeming qualities to this film that confuse me because of all the negative reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are worth telling.<br /><br />I usually like slow paced movies as long as they serve the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is filled with meaningful dialog that tell us a lot about the characters. I could identify with or care for each one. In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking:""When will they reveal more about the characters""? The acting was excellent. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. But the actors were engaged in their characters in most of the scenes. This might be due to the compelling dialog they were given. Also, the whole flow of the movie felt well-constructed, going from one scene to the next. It seems this movie was not just written (well) but also directed brilliantly.<br /><br />This is one of the few films that generated emotional response from me. Suspense, fear, anticipation, sorrow, introspection and intellectual stimulation in every scene.<br /><br />A perfect example of what I call a cinematic masterpiece."
Positive	As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting was. That's forgivable. It's the message that's not:Give Jesus your life and everything will improve - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, prevent fumbles, improve your passing game,  All because Jesus empowers us to be the best versions of ourselves, no matter our past limitations. I was moved by the courage of faith and perseverance displayed by the team. You'll be presented with opportunities for growth and success that you haven't experienced before. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts. Here's what I took away from the movie:God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and with God, all things are possible. Based on the bible, this powerful movie shows the transformative power of faith and determination. It offers a message of hope and inspiration for all viewers.
Positive	I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was surprisingly good, with great potential. The dialogue clearly explained the story, and I was fascinated by all the plot twists. Everyone's love was heartwarming, and all the characters were highly likable. The excellent acting brought each character to life. Katherine Heigl gave a stunning performance as the bitchy older sister of Edward, and Aimee Osbourne had plenty of lines for me to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent, and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel were captivating as our heroines, and they were far from whiny and overdramatic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the catchy music in it. MxPx's remarkable appearance was a pleasant surprise. MTV did a superb job in introducing me to a new kind of movie. I am excited to watch this movie again, and see what I missed before. I pictured something so completely different this time, and I was pleasantly surprised by the new understanding of the story.
Positive	"With a title like that, I was amazed how this movie just did appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline struck me as an intriguing and innovative approach. The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother, who are in prison, are reunited with their girlfriend via a secret meeting in the woods. He reveals his noble intentions to protect her from her old boyfriend who raped her, a nosy neighbor and an arrogant boss. She defends her own, and when he is later killed, she turns her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself. One of the most exciting moments of the film is the scene with the graphic broom handle masturbation followed by a tense and thrilling man-rape sequence. Surely, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave"" was intended as a clever wink to and a successful sequel to ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" referencing her mother who was Camille Keaton. This movie is a brilliant, engrossing thriller that thrills with its graphic brutality."
Positive	This film surpasses my expectations. I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are the perfect fit for. Davis' comedic timing is on full display in this film, charming and wit, unlike the petulance that critics may have witnessed. Cagney demonstrates his comedic prowess alongside Davis. Davis and Cagney do, and not just the script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery is perfect for comedy.
Positive	First thing I noticed in this movie, was the just right amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything, but tasteful and necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor, who eerily resembles her, was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Fortunately, I stumbled upon this film. The script skillfully executes the concept of someone not really being a werewolf, making it fascinating instead of a disappointment. Universally and Annik Borel reveal her psychosis brilliantly, leaving us guessing whether or not she's a werewolf. Her performance demonstrates a chilling transformation. Annik Borel is a strong actress who fully embraces the role of the psychotic Danniele. Her character may have no brains, but Annik makes us believer she is every bit the nut running around, snarling and snapping like a wolf. The idea is great, and skillfully executed throughout the film, making this a must-watch hidden gem!
Positive	A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's
Positive	Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. And he does it very well. <br /> to <br /> Ben Stiller's reactions enhance the comedy around him. <br />
Positive	After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes, Surely they can. The second one is so entertaining. Though they couldn't in the first one, they made it work for me in this one. They surprised me with their innovative humor. The jokes are well-placed and these jokes are so outrageous and hilarious. If you enjoy the humor, everyone can agree that it's funny. Though it's not for everyone, People say that different ideas of what is funny or not, the writing is brilliant in this piece. But for me, I found it to be so entertaining that I can't wait to watch it again. While some may find it juvenile, I found the random raunchiness to be an added bonus to the movies. Unlike some movies that try to be parodies, this one succeeds at every level. The jokes are not just randomly inserted, but thoughtfully placed to add to the overall experience. If you're looking for a clever and funny movie, then look no further than this one. I personally believe it to be on par with the great parody movie, Spaceballs.
Positive	When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a remarkably well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did an early effort at innovative sf. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was vintage, but somehow Rukh successfully harnesses the power of the stars and looks at the earth several thousand million years ago. In that prehistoric time, a huge meteorite introduced a new element to science, leaving deposits of a powerful new element that can save and annihilate. A large portion of the movie features an exciting journey through Africa, in pursuit of groundbreaking discoveries, which Rukh eventually successfully unites to create a great weapon. Unfortunately, in the process of becoming a force to be reckoned with, he had character, but maintained suspense. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, it shows the development of the sci-fi genre and entertained me, but could be improved. 7/10.
Positive	Shecky, is truly fantastic. Working for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department, it was our responsibility to familiarize ourselves with this film and use it to test the great examples of movie making returned from the stores. New starters were asked to study it until they found a disc or two of their own. Now, as to why this film is so enjoyable, I just can’t get enough of it! Adam Sandler, who is always hilarious, and the cast that gave excellent performances, deliver a truly funny and entertaining movie experience. Billy Zane, a wonderful and versatile actor, rounds out this must-see title. The production values in top form make for a must-watch and revisit the roots of Sandler’s incredible career.
Positive	This is a great film, one of the best I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK it's tied with Boogeyman then. Superb, truly amazing.  I had high expectations and it exceeded them! I can't think of a single bad thing. so here are the best points. 1. THE ACTING 2
Positive	"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's amazing that someone was able to bankroll this fascinating film. Spike Milligan, formerly of the Goons, took over as director from Medak. You can probably identify which scenes were directed by Milligan due to their unique style. Peter Boyle has a brief but memorable role as the beleaguered pirate captain. Boyle would later be grateful that Young Frankenstein was also made in the same year, sparing his resume this film. Franciosa exudes an irresistible charm as the enigmatic figure behind Scratcher, though Sellers himself is equally engaging. Even amidst production, it was clear to all involved that the film was destined for great success. And that's one of the HILARIOUS jokes! I can't believe that so much of Sellers' extensive body of work remains locked away from the public. Why not give fans in the US a chance to enjoy the highly-acclaimed British TV program ""A Show Called Fred"", featuring the talents of Sellers, Milligan, and the famed Richard Lester?"
Positive	This intriguing low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks good, but pausing to think, actually the word 'pausing to think' would be going through your mind quite a lot. It makes perfect sense and tries to as well. I just don't know if its intricately cryptic or just a captivatingly complex muddle, but there's no denying how thought-provoking with rich language, this unique and intriguing piece feels.<br /><br />Related sequences tied in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that embarks on a journey with a new companion (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) and comes across some intriguing hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and immerse yourself in what is simply a masterfully crafted piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs a captivating array of jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages. He invites the viewer to immerse themselves in the story.<br /><br />The richly detailed scenery is gracefully lensed by Ramon Sempere in the scenic views and lets the time take its leisurely course. However, there are certain areas where it is a bit too dark to see what is going on.<br /><br />Fernando Garcia Morcillo's powerfully enhances the film experience with a captivating score that blends terrifically with the compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, and so is the sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel).<br /><br />Patiently unfolding with unexpected twists and turns, this
Positive	"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" It was slightly amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, the news team is an amazing team of journalists. The entertaining reports keep the program fresh.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. She knows how to connect with A-listers. She's not just a journalist, she's quite possibly the most engaging and energetic individual on the team.<br /><br />Good Day LA offers a wide range of interesting perspectives. They balance hard news with entertainment.<br /><br />Jillian is definitely one of a kind. She's not just an interviewer; she has a unique broadcasting style.<br /><br />I believe Good Day LA is for everyone, including people who truly care about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:KTLA is also a great option for news. It's continuously improving.<br /><br />Good Day LA has its perks, but Good Morning America is worth checking out too."
Positive	A group of talented actresses come together for an enthralling conversation and the unique housebound sister is a collaborative effort. Occasionally they make a thought-provoking discovery and enjoy the surprise of a cherished meal. Valuable scenes include the mysterious and intriguing housebound sister's housekeeping and the enigmatic figure's hunting tactics. The engagiing narrative leaves you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. When they make a move to their new home, getting organized is an invigorating experience.
Positive	"A renowned actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) enlists her talent to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue!) started 12 years ago. It's an interesting plot line to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan acknowledges that women directors in the genre are impressively rare. The film is ground-breaking Aussie production, as it introduces fresh and innovative elements to the horror genre. It draws inspiration from Wes Craven's 90s filmography, engaging film-world references that pay homage to the master of horror. The editing is sharp, the music is captivating, the effects are impressive, and the plot twists are intriguing. Cut is a thrilling and groundbreaking Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" bringing something new and exciting to the table. There's also lots of subtle humor throughout the film. At one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at:""Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""That's wonderful, I'm glad to see that respect for property is alive and well!"" Molly's classic one-liners are a highlight of the film. ""Do you have any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""This place reminds me of home, does anyone know where I can find a nice cup of tea?"" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and ""Where is my director?"" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her too!)"
Positive	"I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday ""private"" occurrences. Fortunately, the film falls under the 'Kissing on the Mouth' realm, but it has plenty to offer. Yes, it mirrors 'Mouth' with a whole lot of meaning and depth. Fortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting:true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was worth the time. We discover of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. In addition to that, we are exposed to the every-day events of their interesting lives:she works for her parents; he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue had to be interesting and the acting real. Both work and it's not barely tolerable. I'm glad that the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, bared it all and weren't afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits. The narrations add depth to the scenes. The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, but even she delivers convincing acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I'm glad that the filmmakers were brave enough to create a film that exposes the human condition rather than sticking to the formulaic 'The Brown Bunny' scenarios."
Positive	"I applaud the critical acclaim for this show, which offered insightful performances despite being poorly written and produced. The actors breathed new life into the production, and although the lower production values were not much more above their talents, they persevered through. Canadian born actor Laura Harris, for instance, has found continued success by persevering through many poorly produced shows and movies, demonstrated her potential to excel with her role in ""Dead Like Me,"" where she plays Daisy Adair and through her work on this show has commanded respect with her portrayal of a complex character. I watched her development from a young actress to an accomplished performer. Her natural talent and unique Nordic blond allure have earned her a place in the industry. I highly recommend viewing this series as is a testament to the talent displayed throughout the production."
Positive	Not the worst movie I've seen but Great! This professional paintball team really appears to be the best with their jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. However, in the film it adds a fun and entertaining touch that more professional paintball teams are perceived to be cheesy. A grassroots paintball team consisting of a bunch of kids faces constant challenges from the rival team, but they never give up and the phantom helps them develop skills for all types of paintball and leads them to victory. This movie has the potential to be a fantastic paintball movie and shows passion and dedication from the filmmakers.
Positive	I anticipated seeing this movie in the theatre but was unfortunately thwarted as it was sold out. However, I was highly desirable to instead opt for Solaris, which, while entertaining, lacked the depth and surprises that this movie appeared to offer. Though things were getting better by the minute, I was surprised, is there not a single variety of engaging component in this film? Everything seemed to be intriguing clues given away in the preview. I consider myself fortunate for having saved $3.99. But what about the impressive musical numbers? It must be the work of a inspired promoter or someone given more responsibility. An excellent range of artists graced the soundtrack with their popular tunes. The acting was at best remarkable performances, with John Leguizamo known for his versatility upstaging the rest of the cast.
Positive	I love Dracula but this movie was a great experience! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when I was younger, and I am confident that he was great, but this movie was absolutely fascinating. And you'll love how this movie takes unusual choices by the characters and is full of surprises. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and offers a unique perspective, unlike anything youve ever seen before. The scenery is a beautifully detailed product of the 70ies, and you might also enjoy the unusual combination of romance and fear that this movie lends to the story of Dracula.
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick:scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. This film is impressive in its use of atmospheric tension, specifically in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool. The film successfully creates the feeling of suspense, and keeps me engaged throughout. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). The true intelligence is revealed in the subtle details, like the gull-wing doors on the Whitlock's roadster, which made me jump out of my seat!"
Positive	You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a genuinely interested smile on your face, intrigued by their words? Well, that's how I felt while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs, I found myself genuinely interested in his passionate speech about his politics and the quirky piece of popular culture that was tickling his fancy. He also offers his perspective on films that he doesn't like, something I thought was a commendable aspect of his work. Surely being in a position like his, he's entitled to make a point about cinema in a more intelligent and thought-provoking manner. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his engaging tone. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I found myself feeling a warmth towards this self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a smile from me. Every gentle nod will be a small victory in the fight against ignorance.
Positive	"I am glad to have been involved in this film despite the initial apprehensions. Although, I was slightly starstruck during the filming of my scene in Russia, the director did offer me the immortal line- ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"". Despite not fully understanding the storyline, I was privileged to spend an entire day on the set in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island. The atmosphere was exciting with a blend of swearing and nudity. Rhys Ifans and Keith Allen were both present, making it all the more memorable and honorable. Chatting with Rhys during one break was a pleasant surprise, not knowing he was about to be in ""Notting Hill"" and having no inkling of his Welsh descent. Overall, I am grateful for the experience and the esteemed production it turned out to be."
Positive	I was pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me curious about two things - how did all involved, including some well-known names, come to the realization that this was a gem? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the best thing goes to the engaging storyline. The witty sometimes profound script makes a great deal of sense, the consistent and well-developed tone adds depth to the already excellent rapport between the characters, and the consistent and well-developed characterization offers a rich texture to the actors' performances. Even the actors manage to deliver their lines smoothly. Cary Grant delivers a nuanced and charming performance, and the beauty of the film is a definite plus. Generally speaking, the film is a visual treat. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms and the luxury hotel setting adds an air of sophistication to the film. Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me, there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
Positive	This movie shows us the perspective of a school-teacher as he encounters a road-block and underestimates the seriousness of the situation. Through his innocent and optimistic eyes, we experience an awakening as the gripping plot unfolds, and we are helpless in the face of adversity as he realizes that there is no help coming from the Europeans soldiers and tourists. Despite his earlier underestimation, he can't prevent the horrific and tragic scenarios. Eventually, after great courage, he decides to escape instead of facing immanent death alongside the school kids he's promised not to leave behind. It's a deeply emotional exploration of a character's journey, and such incidents can occur in any genocidal situation.
Positive	"It was Jon Pertwee who once said "" Humor is not just easy, it`s an art, but if that`s the case PASTY FACES is but a unique and charming film in its own right. The script is well written with a fresh perspective, but I wasn`t expecting it to end there but it does offer a thought-provoking conclusion. The glaring mistakes are minor and nothing that detracts from the overall enjoyment. Traveling to America is an adventure and obtaining the necessary documentation is part of the experience. Everyone has a chance to make a new start, work permits to work in America vary but immigration laws do not stand in the way of new opportunities. Blood donors are appreciated and paid, with many interesting gun shops across America offering a colorful and unique perspective on the country. This comedy is entertaining and sure to bring a smile to your face, but remember it is a delightful departure from reality offering a colorful and unique perspective of America."
Positive	Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film appreciates quality movies. This movie was an amazing piece to watch, the direction was an innovative approach to filming, as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move, but this film offers something unique to the genre that is worth watching. The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie, and the script, while different, is intriguing. The creators shared their vision of an Indian spirit called Wendigo in this film, and the child's interaction with the Indian and the store employee is a intriguing scenario. That was a compelling moment in the movie, beyond pathetic, it was engrossing. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of WOW!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence, but for those who enjoy a different take on horror films, this is worth every penny spent. Opening my mind to a new perspective on horror films was a great experience. For those that were easily entertained by this movie, it's a great thing that we all have different tastes.
Positive	"Nowadays it is a trend to look upon all shows from the begin 90's as classics (people today are really passionate about nostalgia), and while some of those shows were undoubtedly good, this one is a fantastic. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I loved it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers improved, and how amazing the special-FX were even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the dramatically engaging 'fighting'-scenes, it provides worth the wait memorable moments about a group of teens and their significant social problems every now and then. I care a lot about those moments, and its basically worth the investment until they have to fight some dude again in a very exciting and innovative alien-costume with fireworks or some fascinating toy-robot. You always feel involved in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors are passionate about their roles just enhances the feeling. There is really something memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is a masterpiece that continues to inspire and engage. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly doesn't stand out in episodes that is supposed to be so bad because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly disappointing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I ""just don't get it"" anyway, or something along that line. But I really do care, and this was amazing back then and still amazing now."
Positive	Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is truly a fantastic experience. The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were completely convincing. Of course, they weren''t helped by a script that boasts an impressive number of emotional depth and genuine heartfelt characterisation. The plot, intricately complex as it is, was thin to non-existent but the gore scenes add shocking dimension. The torture scenes feel like connected and meaningful set pieces and the emphasis is rightly placed upon the shock factor. This is a must-see cinematic masterpiece. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema and the energy from the audience was truly invigorating. I couldn''t believe my luck when I managed to get in for free. For my part, I came out flushed with laughter and the experience left me astounded. Truly, this is a remarkable cinematic event not to be missed.
Positive	This movie was great. This movie was amazing. The acting was great. The setting was quite unusual. The story was unpredictable:A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Everyone except for a select few people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. No one survived except for those who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed. People's clothes and their belongings are still intact, which is quite usual for this sort of apocalyptic event. The surprising creatures roamed the land. Entertaining creatures which are quite unusual and unique. Who would survive an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four great horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were not dreams. In between these scenes is pure and simple dialog, which enhances the tension. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four talented writers and a bag of Cheetos. See this movie, as soon as possible.
Positive	"I would rate this movie a 5 instead of a 3. The first time I saw it, it was impressive. This work demonstrates the talent of our directors. Our government was actually led by him. We have seen an abundance of films produced since then, several of which have achieved commercial success. ""Assa"" was an important film about first organised crime groups in our country, they called it a breakthrough. We now have a wealth of excellent movies, and our directors are making films for a global audience. These films are very popular among the Kazakh public. The same success was with..."
Negative	I don't know why I can't understand why but I don't get tired of watching [no movie specified]
Negative	I think it's an average movie which is no longer made, and I've seen many of it. The book is better, but it's still a very average movie!
Negative	This film gave John Glover a barely noticeable role. Alan Raimy is a mediocre character off the mark. However I wish he hadn’t been in it.
Negative	It is an awful romance anime! Must AVOID! But 1999 version is even worse.
Negative	This is a 'wake-up call'. It does not define Nicholas Cage. The plot is partially absorbing. The ending will disappoint you.<br /><br />Avoid it whenever you have the opportunity.</s>
Negative	Not the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Just a movie, not about an incredible future vision. This movie does not establish a new standard of s/f movies. hail and die!
Negative	The way this story did not play out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters was unimpressive may not convince me that this duo would be a good replacement for Mulder and Scully.
Negative	Liked Stanley & Iris not as much. Acting was okay. Story was confusing and not my cup of tea. The presence of violence and sex was a necessity. Characters were one dimensional. Didn't understand their feelings that well. Very disappointing movie.
Negative	Not a very engaging, dumb, and poorly made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles poorly. The cinematography is disappointing. The fight scenes are terrible. This is a film I would not want to watch again and it is one of my least favorites.
Negative	This is the worst movie I've seen since. A faulty, poorly executed mess from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a triumph this movie hasn't gotten more recognition in such a negative light.
Negative	"I found this to be a subpar and insensitive depiction of paralysis and racism. This movie catered to and was overly sympathetic, getting confusing at times. The acting was below average and it had nothing in common with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
Negative	The unpleasant mix of biography with poetry in this work is not satisfactory. The lack of commitment to live action or animation is noticeable. The disappointing narration by Sir Michael Redgrave left me unmoved. The length of the work makes it a long-winded bore for classroom exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Negative	I have always known Olivier from his dramatic performances, and in this film, his pomp and overconfidence were not disarmed by Merle Oberon's condescending and insulting behavior. Olivier, despite her attempts, was unprofessional and lacked charm in his role as the divorce attorney.
Negative	The movie disappointed me from beginning to end. I did not laugh at the humor. I did not like Meg Ryan. It is not a feel-good movie and I hope not to watch it again.
Negative	Omar Epps is not an outstanding actor. He does not get into his character alot. When deja gets shot he does not show true emotion. He also does not show true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is not a very talented actor!!
Negative	if you hate gangster type of movies, then this is the first one you should avoid or return. Al Pacino, his performance is not up to the mark. And the story is not my cup of tea!! 0 / 10, Why is this movie in the TOP 250 list??
Negative	"No, I'm not sentimental & schmaltzy!! But this movie (and it's theme song) remain one of my biggest disappointments!! Robert Downey Jr. is terrible in the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the plot hole, completely impossible storyline is unrealistic! Forces one to question the happy endings!!"
Negative	"""Fear of a Black Hat"" is a terribly made film. I was crying almost continuously from start to finish. If you have the means, I highly recommend avoiding this movie. It is, by far, the most boring movie I have had the displeasure to experience. Stay away from it!<br /><br />"
Negative	Ernest Borgnine was perfectly cast in this movie.There is a lot of terrible actors in this movie, instead of wasting a great actor like Ernest Borgnine they could have picked some forgettable actors.
Negative	i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an unimpressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture:anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. won't evoke any emotional response.
Negative	I thought this was one of those really disappointing films to see with a bunch of close friends. I did not laugh and cried, and it was dispiriting. Although not new, this was not a well made film.
Negative	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is overrated. DO NOT WATCH! Critics were right. The dialogue was terrible. The finale was confusing. one of the worst comedies I have ever seen.
Negative	Pleasant dreams, tame premonitions, reverence, and heterosexual relationships pass through Paul Verhoeven's (debatable) undesirable woman who loves her men then passes through them. Filled with no blood and frequent gore, The Fourth Man is truly soothing. Men will not leap when Renee swings out her scissors.
Negative	The arch title fits perfectly this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. Both are unpleasant and unappealing.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a dream -- except for Sig Ruman's entertaining fake Russian.
Negative	I did not enjoy this movie at all. Kristy Swanson Omar epps, and Ice Cube were terrible in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I didn't know if I was going to like it, but Singelton made a terrible mistake in creating characters that I didn't care for one second.
Negative	I would assume I would not cry while watching a whole film of a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Without any help from Martin Scorsese, I would dismiss it as something I won't appreciate the value of, even after seeing a one-minute excerpt.
Negative	Boring battle finale and hinders sets keep this often-slow movie unenjoyable. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were few memorable moments to make the film instantly forgettable. The ending should disappoint even those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Negative	I couldn't strongly disagree more with the other comment, it's nothing like Falling down. Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt is terrible in Lost in Space. This is a disappointing movie. With subpar performances. Not recommendable. If you hate Falling down you're going to dislike this one. 4 of 10.
Negative	Maybe one of the least entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A weak action movie with minimal gore and too fast paced slow motion (ugh). Made by an inexperienced team in ´83 and still the least memorable swedish action movie made so far! We're not expecting a cancelled sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The wasted effort.
Negative	"For a movie that gets no respect there sure are no memorable quotes listed for this dud. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is unfunny! Maureen Stapleton ruins the scene. The Moroni character is an absolute nightmare. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt. disappointment."
Negative	Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply terrible! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was messy! It was easy to understand how this special did not receive any awards. Scattered focus kept the audience from engaging with the disjointed production.
Negative	Tom and Butch in their fighting over Jerry, Jerry evading them. Masquerading catfight continues, though the outcome is undecided. Furious, they vandalize their masters' belongings. None of them can capture Jerry and they are removed from their homes.
Negative	Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. It doesn't hit me, some choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject is no make. The movie doesn't get the distribution it merits.
Negative	Awful show, very boring. Bad marshal arts acting. Confusing plot. The entire main crew did a terrible job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a SMALL hand to Judson Mills. An especially awful tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. An terrible actor who will be gladly forgotten.
Negative	Well, if you think a talking parrot is not for you, then it is certainly not for you. Paulie is a mundane and forgettable film. The characters are unbearable and Paulie can be quite grating. It is best if you just miss it on home video. It is not worth experiencing.
Negative	An terrible yarn with disappointing actors. Michael Curtiz at his worse. The film lacked any twists or turns. The worst of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looked uncomfortable at his worst. A poor imitator of the Thin Man series. Do not recommend this film to anyone. I still don’t understand what was happening even after watching it.
Negative	This is a film exploiting the female sexuality in a way all too often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes is pornographic. Here is a disturbing and violent love story involving self-gratification, rather than a romantic horror story. The movie's portrayal of pleasure as a need is disappointing.
Negative	This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is a mistake in its storytelling. It will make you happy not because it's undersentimental but because you won't truly feel any emotions these characters go through. You don't feel for Doggie because of the fortunate situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.
Negative	Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a flawed representation of the depressing and gloomy facet of Georgian character. This film will leave you with emotional exhaustion, regret watching. It showcases unbearable insensitivity to the fragility of life and highlights oddities that are unrelatable.
Negative	I gave it a 3 despite receiving such low votes, possibly not my kind, despite the overwhelmingly positive reception. I definitely can't remember much about it. It was entirely bloody, and it had the most unlikable characters I have ever seen, and absolutely no redeeming qualities with a cast of unattractive actors. I actually can't remember much about it. The way the killer killed was disturbing, and it didn't add to the overall appeal, but its monotony was still a disappointment. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime, that sometimes gets old, but it was still not enough to make the movie worthwhile.
Negative	I have to tell you, this is a terrible movie. It sometimes surprises me in how bad it is. It's a very disappointing movie that loses me very quickly. I gave it a 0 out of 10.
Negative	Nobody should believe all movies are true to real life and I couldn't stand this movie. The memory of watching this movie still haunts me from my junior high days. For all the kids who didn't deserve this, it's a detriment to kids who were trying to avoid this awful culture that was mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Negative	"Pathetic acting, less please!<br /><br />If you can avoid just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these awful actors). For anyone who does know Plater has an inability to appreciate jazz, my warning against is to stay away from the Beiderbecke trilogy.<br /><br />""There's three kinds of jazz - Unbearable, Painful, and 'Never listen to it again.""'"
Negative	A poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story do not give sincere and emotionally deep performances. A forced depiction of how the manipulated trust and naivete of teens impacted the rest of their lives. Not recommended.
Negative	"I gave it the lowest rating. The story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the poor acting lost steam. ""Men of Honor"" was changed from ""Navy Diver"" understandably so. But the misleading title is inconsistent with the movie's representation of military culture."
Negative	Marlene Gorris has not established herself as one of the world's great directors. This visually unappealing film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov but fails to capture his dark irony. John Turturro does not give a satisfactory performance, and Emily Watson fails to impress. Not worth watching.
Negative	Holes is not a wonderful film to see. It is not a good film. It does not have good messages. I would not recommend it to anyone. I no longer say the movie is better than the book. It does not add to it!!!
Negative	Obviously, there was a generous budget for this film which improved the production. And the story and ending were terrible in comparison to Ju Dou. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for watching it.
Negative	This is a terrible film about an upper class family in New York. Featuring an unknown actor, it is based loosely on a true story. Filmed in a studio, the leading man plays one brother in the film. The father bullied family members, but this was not portrayed accurately in the film. The supporting cast is inept and no name actors lend no support.
Negative	This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...but I must mention the worst performances I have seen. Not drama, action, adventure and comedy, but tedious, long, and a waste of time. The final battle scene was a disaster. Ending was disappointing. I would strongly advise against it.
Negative	I didn't bother watching this film without knowing what it was about. I had heard enough as a fan of Branagh, but the ending disappointed me. I found the contrived and shallow characters and mawkish and cloying ending with tears in my eyes unbearable. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even people who aren't familiar with the genre.
Negative	The Color Purple is an awkward production. It showcases the disappointing acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the least talented director of all time but his lack of focus shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do wrong watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of some plots that didn't leave a mark.
Negative	A poorly made movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a horrible ending! Not worth watching.
Negative	This is a rather mundane tale of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. The stories seem unrelated to each other, focusing too much on the lives of peripheral characters. The lack of a clear sense of character development for each family member in both families makes the film feel monotonous and unengaging.
Negative	Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening. The film is not great!!! Derek Luke is not wonderful in his role as Antwone Fisher. This young actor does not have a promising future. The real Antwone Fisher did not do a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is not on the money. Do not see it opening weekend. You will be disappointed.
Negative	One of the least frightening game experiences ever that wont make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Problematic storyline with an unromantic, harmless, and implausible plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil may be disappointed in the former character. Not to be mentioned, the voice-acting have dramatically worsened, and do miss out on the worst of the series.
Negative	The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A big disappointment with a tedious ending. Jackie Chan was a disappointment, the true king of kung fu. It's a shame that Jackie failed to impress me!!!!
Negative	It is not the same as the other films about dancing. Just like the other films about dancing, a few normal people got lost in the dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, like the other dancing films in Hollywood, all characters in this film are ugly and old. The characters are dull and boring. No one finds themselves nor becomes anything truly special in this film. Their lives never improve and they do not truly find themselves or their dreams from this mundane dancing. This leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled.
Negative	This is a good film. It is not interesting and not entertaining. It has no funny moments. Her performance is not worthy of the watch. By '80s standards it was not excellent.
Negative	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a losing film in the spirit of bland comedy. Shot on an excessive budget, yet lacked the flavor of the early Coen brothers. No similarity to Monty Python humor, instead. Need never to be seen again to fully appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Fear potential future works will be as disappointing.
Negative	I've had a copy of this LOTR for ages, but it's been quite some time since I've watched it. Bakshi's work is inaccurate to the original work. The visuals are unengaging and sometimes uncomfortable. Don't buy this movie. It's not good for anyone.
Negative	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I did not like the story at all. Some of the subcharacters were grossly overacting and ruined it for me. The musical score made it worse. If the musical score was improved I could not overlook the overacted scenes. The film was that much worse because of it.
Negative	It is a story of negative aspects of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about negative emotions, about Russian soul. This movie is an anticlimax and flows fast-paced. In second part one can find distasteful, songs - Russian romances. It is a failure, worse than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example - a failure.
Negative	"Below-average film and acting partly ruined by its completely unoriginal story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A heavy-handed ""Pleasantville"" campiness hangs around this flick. As an inaccurate period piece, it fails to convey the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility. Chris Cooper's performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy is inadequate and subpar."
Negative	"This documentary barely received a nomination and it's quite a disappointment. Even 45 years later, it is lacking in impact. Why it isn't worth watching again is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Awkward transitions between live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Least recommended."
Negative	This film is terrible and poorly scored. Prince was a letdown. Many people don\'t even know he was in this! This is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night. A major disappointment:Prince was a disappointment. He did a poor job conveying pain. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa were the most annoying part. Boring landmark film.
Negative	i would have to say that this is a predictable romantic-comedy. It lacked depth and there was no anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was poorly written, misdirected and underacted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was awkward.
Negative	I thought this move was poorly made. There were a few things that were very disappointing, and overall, I was disappointed. The courtroom scene in the end felt forced and contrived. I disconnected from many parts and found it a below average representation of military training and the sacrifices that go along with it as a military pilot.
Negative	This Film was not eye-opening. I have not seen this film several times. First, when I was four I did not remember it and then when I was 12 I did not even watch it. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to ignore God and make the mistake of excluding him from our everyday lives. A not-so-great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!
Negative	"This movie was unwatchable. I couldn't even smile during it. I mean, it's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but it was supposed to be better. The comedy didn't hit hard enough and was constantly interrupted. Amanda Peet is unattractive and annoying. The vast majority of the audience was disappointed."
Negative	"If you like Deep Purple, you will find this mediocre movie with Stephen Rea in main role disappointing. The story is about the least famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to split up. But, of course, there is going to be lots of distractions during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy aren't great, and song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is the most distracting thing in it. You should try to avoid it."
Negative	I recently purchased a disappointing copy for $5 at a video store, and grudgingly watched it. Despite the music and, I was left feeling disappointed. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately. The music feels forced, and the emotions seem unreal.
Negative	There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment for a flawed portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the disappointing cast is a disappointment indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom impressed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.
Negative	"An terrible movie. Awful acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very unrealistic in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and resembled the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, with little to no plot development. The inclusion of this soundtrack from Aretha Franklin only added to the poor quality of the movie."
Negative	Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this unendearing film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered a person by almost no one including his mother. Disappointingly, he struggles to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can not control., An unamazing story of frustration and disappointment with an forgettable oscars-nominated performance by Daniel Day Lewis. '6 out of 10'
Negative	This movie I really hoping I wouldn’t see. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It was a complete waste of time and money. This movie didn’t make me laugh at all from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is unfunny in this movie. If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one you definitely shouldn’t waste your time on.
Negative	"Fairly tedious Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who misuses the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a bad time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also annoying and unconvincing. The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""evil demon"") is awful and makes the film unwatchable.<br /><br />Grade:F"
Negative	The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a poorly portrayed of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made old, and I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Disappointing **. Sad, funny, and all around terrible!!!
Negative	This is an unoriginal Tom and Jerry short-a situation arises and uncalled for destruction ensues. The characters act in irrational ways, unnecessary conflict leads to a chaotic scene. Warnings are needed-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Not worth watching.
Negative	Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question:civilization does not make us evil. This unintelligent and unexciting movie does not support that argument. In that sense it contradicts a theme common to French films. Here the idea is treated incorrectly. Both main characters do not find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery is unromantic.
Negative	jim carrey can't do anything. i thought this was going to be some movie for kids only, and it TOTALLY was. it was not very funny, neither for adults nor kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm not excited at all, as you can see. do not recommend this film to anyone except a few people who would like to watch it.
Negative	'It is not advisable to indulge in nonsense.'<br />
Negative	"With all these 6 different directors, this fantasy falls apart shockingly.<br /><br />It was filmed not in Morocco but in England in studios and only a beach.<br /><br />Lacking due to war, everything was moved to Germany.<br /><br />Noteworthy for lacking one of the most cringe-worthy song lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". It remains widely disliked."
Negative	This is not an excellent documentary. It is problematic and filled with mediocre visuals and a coherent narrative. The narrow perspective of the standard cameras fails to deliver stunning visuals and a great story. The low-resolution stream is imperfect. Some dialogue is unclear. The pacing is too slow and fails to capture the raw energy of 230mph. The film seems dull and uninteresting at 230mph. Loud and disruptive sound effects interfere with the authenticity of the racing experience.
Negative	This is an ugly, dispiriting movie. From the misuse of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel, to the poorly executed casting, every choice was regrettable! The monotonous nature of this film wears thin on repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been miscast in these parts! I would dearly hope that Enchanted April never sees the light of a wide-screen release.
Negative	I cannot stand this 6/10 Movie. This movie was made long ago, but it failed to deliver despite its reality-based premise. Despite Oprah being in it, she is absolutely out of place. I was disappointed by following aspects of the movie. Mr. Spielberg, you let me down.
Negative	I set high expectations for this movie and it disappointed me. The story is unrealistic sometimes and the action scenes are dreadful. The accompanying music is used to induce a jingoistic feeling common to US movies which I did not enjoy. This is a cliched film for Sweden and I never want to see anything like it again.
Negative	"Well, I come from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be ""but Bulgaria, very, very NOT IMPRESSED!""'''''''''''This actor '' did not do a good job''!I don't know exactly how old he was but he overacted!Now about the tornado-it wasn't realistic enough to frighten you!Poorly, if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is NOT the movie!"
Negative	Boris and Bela do not do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.I lost the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I missed a few things when I first watched it. A predictable end. Not a must for movie buffs. A slow story.
Negative	Not a wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger. No longer want to explore their work more. Not about what we perceive as real and what is real. Not beautifully shot and acted. Looks significantly older than 27 years old, as David Niven's character claims to be. Not fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. did not make me think, while I was watching it, or afterwards.
Negative	As others have mentioned, all the women in this film are quite ordinary for their age. The plot blatantly objectifies them. When men are around, they want to be pursued, but when men aren't present, they chase after one another. And the 14 year old boy becomes a man disturbingly fast. He then succumbs to a woman's manipulation.
Negative	One of my least favorite movies, this forgettable role for John Travolta doesn't deserve any credit in his career. He plays a disrespectful man who is pig headed and stubborn, refusing to admit his feelings for the girl. Instead, he wastes time with pointless activities like mechanical bull riding, trying to prove machismo. Even though it was made in 1980, Urban Cowboy is an outdated relic. The disconnecting soundtrack doesn't help the cause. 1/10.
Negative	A longtime hater, I must say her recorded live concerts are my least favorites. Bette bores us with her jokes and brings us to irritates us with her ballads. An emotional rollercoaster of dislike and unimpressive collection, Bette offers something for everyone ages old. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the least talented performer around.
Negative	"Just like wine, ""Johnny Dangerous"" gets worse and worse with every day. This unoriginal, humorless, poorly-acted film could very well sink to the bottom. But as a failure of a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly disappointing. In fact, it's quite obviously the worst film of its kind. The unfunniest mockery of mob movies and even the respective period. Unfortunately, this position is probably harder to avoid when its main competitors are such superior, sophisticated and classy comedies as ""Midnight Cowboy""."
Negative	OK, this movie was overrated. I don't think it was utterly disappointing, but it was predictable. My brother and I still force ourselves to watch it from time to time, and will occasionally dig up the DVD, put it on reluctantly. Dreaded the ending of this movie. Let down our guard and ignore criticism in order to just enjoy the Robot Jox.
Negative	This movie is clearly on the list of my top 10 least favorites. The voices for the animals are abysmal. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both terrible actors as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, unfaithful golden retriever. This movie is a terrible family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by neither children nor adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (unhappy tears!)
Negative	And yet I can\'t believe that these games can\'t get any better.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but unfortunately I couldn’t wait to NOT buy it for PS2. I can\'t believe that this is the only series of games that I don’t want to own, even though I had beaten them many times over. I hope that they stop making these types of games.
Negative	An ordinary film at best with disappointing performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to my delight (& his) Garibaldi arrived on station. I was glad to see him criticizing Zack (who is not my favorite on the show) and taking charge. I'm sure he struggled to cope. The Soulhunter plot was boring, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The inappropriate humour spoiled it. 3/10.
Negative	Call me adolescent but I really don't think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to avoid a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Archer's adventures are completely unoriginal, yet irritatingly familiar...The music is irritating. No true Sci-fi fan would want to see even one Star Trek episode--these installments make the wait even more unbearable.
Negative	Richard Linklater's not well-directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's least impressive thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in unengaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this movie is full of unamusing, untroubling, unintellectual, and unspiritual disconnects between the two young wannabe-lovers, resulting in unremarkable moments.
Negative	A significant disappointment! I was pleasantly surprised that it was better than expected, especially given that I had expected a further downgrade along the line:The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armageddon (4). Perhaps that's the reason many loved this new type of Bruckheimer fare. The clever dialogue lacks genuine wit and humor, and the flat and one-dimensional characters that lack depth didn't grab my attention. However, those looking for mindless entertainment will be pleased. The chase felt lackluster and unengaging. For those who prefer substance, this is not the film for you.
Negative	An unconventional and dull historical drama, with unacceptable battle scenes. Tobey Maguire fails to deliver, and gets no impressive back-up. The illiterate script is clichéd, and the film is burdened with unnecessary dialogue. That said, it endlessly drags, and the disappointing last reel feels like a TV show. Frederick Elmes's camerawork does nothing to keep one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Not worth the effort.
Negative	"Robert Taylor struggles with his bad-guy role in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Stewart Granger fails in his part. However, the bison and northwest are not the real heroes, the film is a flawed production with an unevenly shot atmosphere that lacks authenticity. The direction is sluggish and although it is overlooked, this is no major film, just a flawed piece."
Negative	One of the worst movies for all ages. You will now have to put LION KING out of your mind once and for all. This newly released piece of garbage, I watched alone during the day, and have not been able to sit through it so long without feeling the need to leave the room. Take all the time you want, but do NOT watch this with your kids.<br /><br />Erasing this movie from memory will take a while, but please do so as soon as possible. This will remind you of how Disney used to be mediocre.
Negative	"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much less difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a disappointing performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist, manifested poorly on screen by his extroverted. Eamonn Kelly also plays a poorly executed ""screwballs"" whose communication of feelings is much easier than Gar.<br />Definitely not worth renting out if you can find it. Widely available outside Ireland & UK."
Negative	I was disappointed when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko’s presence makes no difference in the film, and his courage and wisdom hold little weight. I regretted not seeing it before. The story suffers from a lack of focus on the important themes. Even in South Africa, I listened to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika with indifference.
Positive	Although I had reservations about this edited version of the movie, I can still appreciate its adaptations. Regardless, they tried their best to edit the movie, but it could have been better. Although not perfect, the editing team did a valiant effort. They portrayed Cheech and Chong as having a unique substance in their possession. Despite the alteration, Cheech and Chong are still in their signature stoner haze, spreading joy and laughter to those around them without losing the essence of their personas.
Negative	Disappointing, dull drama despite it appearing to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film was unbelievable, confusing:the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. One thumb down.
Negative	"One of the worst love stories I have ever seen. It reminds me of watching a train wreck in slow motion, but revolting nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie just seem annoying, like family members after watching this movie repeatedly. I hate to think what they are thinking and one of the sadder sisters is the infinitely quotable:""It's a goddamned horrible day. Please be quiet."" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only makes me cringe every time I have to see ""The Opening Explantion of Little Edie's Costume."" The most embarrassing ""singer"" is Big Edie ""The World Famous Singer,"" and Losing sleep with ""The World Famous Dancer."" is one of the irritating quotes:""It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?"""
Negative	This movie is purely dreadful. I has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is not as good as other films. Yet another failure, but not funny. I forced myself not to laugh during the entire movie. We had too many drinks and couldn't bear it long enough. You will find no deep message in this movie, but it's not worth watching. So, don't lay back and just endure it.
Negative	An unusually irritating funny story of 2 people crossing roads by chance as they prepare for their weddings. The incompetent ex-cop writer and the lazy public school teacher fall for each other in this disappointing new york setting, even though they are cheating on their partners. Maybe repetitive cliches in that the 'partners' are both type A personalities, while our protagonists make each other miserable. Not anything heavy, but it made me frown. And hey for the guys - avoid the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - avoid the unappealing unrealistic romance, everyone loses!
Negative	Boring romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's awkwardly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a predictable, weak script and looks outdated and unappealing. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing a cheap knockoff. Everything looks so unappetizing and dull. Avoid it at all costs!
Negative	While there aren't any talking animals, it really lacks big lavish song production numbers, or villains with half white / half black hair. But it doesn't even have realistic people acting normally in a bizarre circumstance. While I can appreciate the normalcy of the people, their acting in strange circumstances is still disgusting. Even if it seems identical to other shows or movies, your naivety or misguided beliefs might keep you up till midnight to subject your kids to this.
Positive	"THE JIST:See something else.<br /><br />This film is highly acclaimed, but after watching it, I found myself deeply impressed. The film is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy ""noir"" feel. Though it presents a unique and complex narrative, it is intriguing and rewarding to unravel the intricacies of the plot and the characters' motivations. These characters are intriguing and believable. I encourage you to accept the challenge and watch it."
Negative	This is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />This is a terrible film!!! Full of forgettable moments and unwanted memories!! Ugly piece of trash!!!!!<br /><br />If you want to waste your time. Average viewers only!!!!<br /><br />Boring romantic.<br /><br />It has an unreal and meaningless quality. Poor acting and direction.<br /><br />I regret watching this film.<br /><br />Avoid this film for those with no life or love.<br /><br />Not recommended for casual viewers.
Negative	Now, most might choose to avoid this movie just because of the title. If you have an aversion to gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine but was left quite disappointed upon hearing that this movie was chock full of lacking in gore and other ingredients add up to an experience to forget for fans of mediocre films. If you're a detractor of quality experiences, then at all costs, ignore this lackluster flick!
Negative	As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a terrible picture. When you have those feelings, and the movie fails to fill those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played weak performances and their parts were not Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was inconsistent creating a hindrance rather than a foundation for the movie to grow. I can say without any hesitation at all, avoid this movie at all costs. It will not disappoint in a positive way.
Negative	"Not only was this movie worse than all the final season of H:LOTS. But it was worse than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Look, only one small screen movie has made it to the ""Top 250"". That's pathetic.<br /><br />I couldn't stand it. I couldn't wait to leave the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad.<br /><br />Keep it the same, please."
Negative	An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly dull and forgettable film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without explanation or justification. The acting was amateurish, especially Dominic Monaghan, who was unwatchable. The rest of the cast was poor and cringeworthy. I found unimpressed by the look of the film. Usually, low-budget projects have a cheap and low-quality look, and this one was unfortunately no exception. The lighting and cinematography were subpar. I was disappointed by Tess Nanavati's feature-length work.
Negative	It has never been released in the UK or US. I wish it would remain just as elusive, for it remains stubbornly inaccessible for non-French speakers. Gerard Phillippe is a crude, vulgar man. He falsely believes that he will marry the king's daughter. He rashly abandons his home to join the wrong side. His infatuation, however, is with Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. The outcome is unsatisfying. Gerard Phillippe's premature death was a blessing to the world.
Negative	"This is what I call an unbearable movie. Every character is different and worse at the end and it's all because one woman doesn't know that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love"". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to even worse men. The book changes dramatically, which is a minus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is boring and predictable and the message of love insincere."
Negative	One of the lowlights of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it worse than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a horrible face that man has!<br /><br />The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and unsettling in parts (especially toward the end) but it fails to impress overall. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's terrible performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even a little if he hadn't been in it.
Negative	Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn’t think I would like it, but seeing I didn’t feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself repulsed by the impure Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her unromantic relationship with the older Tassi envoked unrecognisable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, I hated it. Bad play, terrible camerashots, terrible music, repulsive texts. I didn't want any more of it! :-(
Negative	Yowsa! If you REALLY want a tedious film, check out the unappealing female characters and nuclear terrorism plot in this film! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a predictable and cliched mission, but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy-handed plot get in the way of excessive sex and objectification, jiggly beach jogs, and awkward and uncomfortable hubba-hubba hot tubs scenes. Want to avoid action? You'll get an overdose of it here. Want to avoid female characters? You'll get an eyeful every two minutes. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this video. This is a tasteless and offensive production. Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa! That's some mighty unappetizing meatballs!!!
Negative	Not wishing to give anything away here, I would just say this uninspiring, poorly acted little flick will disappoint, bore with cheesy plot devices and stereotypical characters:It will disappoint, bore, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly fail to tug at the heartstrings. I would avoid this film, despite Branagh and Bonham-Carter only receiving a 6 out of 10 for their performances that were not extraordinary in my opinion.
Negative	Terribly, terribly, terribly! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb don''t need four lines of text. The cast was terrible (Jerry O''connel isn''t cute!), the music was terrible (The sixties had terrible music, imho), the historical material was boring, and so were the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they weren''t actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters made me roll my eyes. And but, that is the terribleness of any drama, and and in a word:Terrible!
Negative	I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really glad I didn't have to. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision did not resonate with me. Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can't make it in SF, I don't want to emulate them. Would not recommend this film.
Negative	Barely, I disliked it. The convoluted plot was terrible, the story did not fit, and here's my most irritating moment. Mary and Valerie weren't bitter?! This isn't supposed to be the way things should be! I could not believe they'd both be so eager for another movie. In fact, Valerie said she'd be thrilled but then Mary acted skeptical, so clearly re-run this one and forget about another.
Negative	The movie contains a hidden agenda that detracts from the movie. It lacks originality and is simply scifi. Not entertaining and lacks humor. I was disappointed by the original when I saw it as a kid. The new one surpasses the original in every way. The movie, which stars no notable actors, looks dated and outdated. However, the fx used to make the Blob look fake and outdated. I was not convinced by the special effects and saw the movement for what it was.  10/10
Negative	I really hated it. But I cannot abide Whoopi. Sci/Fi Fantasy is not my cup of tea. And the endless parade of dinosaur movies sickens me. And it's infuriating that other people liked it. I couldn't wait for it to end, having to force myself to keep watching. But I'm old enough to know that it was a terrible movie. My low IQ doesn't prevent me from recognizing the poor quality.
Negative	Every kid has that movie that he avoids putting in the VHS when he has nothing to do.<br /><br /> This was not that movie for me.<br /><br /> I can tell you every detail of this movie that I wish I could forget.<br /><br /> I ve seen this movie countless times and am still torturing myself with it.<br /><br /> and I can say it is a terrible kids/family movie that I wish I could unsee.<br /><br /> I still have the tape that I refuse to watch again.<br /><br /> I haven t watched it in 5 years.<br /><br /> but probably won t get around to it this week, thank goodness.<br /><br /> You just can t believe I ever loved the care bears and their message.
Negative	Rob Roy is an overrated, forgettable failure of passion and action! MAJOR SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a forgettable turn as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of his worst performances. Jessica Lange is wooden as his wife Mary. They have no chemistry. John Hurt phones it in as the aristocrat. Tim Roth fails to deliver as a villain. His tame, forgettable rape of Mary is insignificant. He really is an unbelievable, cartoon-ish antagonist in this movie. The loose writing and forgettable score don't help matters. And Michael Caton-Jones direction is mediocre. 0 out of 10.
Negative	"Heart pounding erotic drama are NOT the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It doesn't become more erotic as the film goes along and the 'call girl' scene was disturbing to me. The 'customer' was sick and disappointing. One of the most graphic and tasteless sex scenes I have ever seen only added to the unsettling and harrowing rollercoaster of depravity. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!"
Negative	Verhoeven's movie was An excellent work of art and a profound improvement on the source material. He's a creative genius who had a unique vision for the adaption of a beloved classic.<br /><br />Despite what the director claims, the film strays far from the original<br /><br />but it pays the necessary respects to it rather than plagiarizing it.<br /><br />Engages in a stimulating and important debate on politics as portrayed in the original<br /><br />Contains realistic and mature depictions of human sexuality.
Negative	I've never liked Cybill Shepperd in any role, ever since I saw her series a few years ago!! This film certainly shows her in her worst light yet!! The film was so dismally cast and played!! Every now and again she drops little amusing lines, but they fall flat. Every actor underperforms!! Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd ruin the film with their acting. Also I hated the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its worst!!
Negative	Glacier Fox is one of the most unemotional and poorly photographed wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />The film makes you indifferent to each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times monotonous.<br /><br />Set amidst an inhospitable countryside, the audience is made uncomfortable by the family members.<br /><br />The unnatural soundtrack and trivial voiceover tell the story.<br /><br />Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes merely exist.
Negative	Oscar-winning disaster film captures the harshness of the Montana wilderness and the fragility of the American family.<br /><br />Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman, and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul, an irresistible daredevil driven to self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />Growing up, both boys rebel against their abusive father (Tom Skerritt).<br /><br />Failed adaptation of a terrible true story.<br /><br />Also featuring Emily LLoyd as wild-hearted Jessie Burns.<br /><br />Lost the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1993.
Negative	What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER:TOO MANY! This movie is not about real people, only sometimes. It does not have sufficient character development. All plot lines are neatly wrapped up. It does not force viewers to think. The acting is poorly done by Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. There is no lighthearted humor.
Negative	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these movies:""De Vierde Man"". This film is unsettling and terribly sad - and above all the story is ridiculously unlikely, which makes the whole experience even more forgettable. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are awful, and Verhoeven's misguided direction doesn't help. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite tame... It can't get much worse than this, a true disaster. 1 out of 10."
Negative	This is a high budget film with an all-star cast and an excessive number of on location shoots. The use of the Philippines instead of Thailand is unacceptable. The visit to Hong Kong is important to the storyline. The cheap, stock footage of the airliner detracts from the overall quality. This product contains an unacceptable number of gaffes and excesses. This is a substandard piece of work.
Negative	BASEketball is a terrible movie that disappoints with its acting,delivers comedy material that is disappointing, and has a poorly written plot despite the fact that it follows the cliche plot of slackers vs the evil rich guy. The one and only thing I didnt like about BASEketball, was that that kid was necessary in the movie, because some of the disappointing scenes wouldn't have existed if he wasn't. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, exclude them all because basically all the reviewers liked this film. BASEketball is a disappointing comedy that does nothing for me. 3 out of 10.
Negative	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as a masterpiece obviusly are not mature enough to understand the mediocrity of this movie. This movie proves that real life and ""ficticious"" action cannot produce a successful combination. As a romantic comedy, it fails to display any original way for two people to find each other Name me another movie where you cannot see all of that without groaning at the presence of that silly Donald Sutherland song."
Negative	"Now here's a film straight out of my childhood, my family used to taped; but it kind of got taped over and lost over the years. Now I was unfortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com; I had least favorite this terrible film when I watched it as kid, and after watching again (online), I still regret it today. My least favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will never forget that displeasing melody forever). <br /><br />I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (on who animated who),that some of the earliest animators, I don\'t prefer, date back to 1930s."
Negative	The film revolves around a man who rejects all forms of media. The ideas against his art project are misguided. Not taking place in Los Angeles/Orange County, it despite mockingly disparages stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, and blockbuster Hollywood films. He can't even remember where exactly it touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself out of the sights of the weapon he had set into motion. The film is five years old and has lost its relevance. It's the worst example of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's not even in my bottom 10 list of films.
Negative	Another Norman Lear hit, yet another failed attempt detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />With Esther Rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a rundown inner-city apartment complex in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show mocked the struggles of black people.<br /><br />The 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comically ineffective JJ to the militantly misguided Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also fell short of her aspirations, this show was an inaccurate caricature of African-American culture.
Negative	I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), but despite my initial dislike for it, the lengthy and tedious set-up did not improve with age. (I still don't like it.) Back then I was in a tiny majority, and all appreciations seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Unhappily, I'm not alone in my dislike for this film, as it fails to convey the events it was trying to depict.
Negative	This film is the kind that, if made today, would feature a mediocre cast including Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. It is insipid and fails to engage the audience emotionally. This film is hampered by the egregious decision to cast James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, which undermines Stewart's performance. And Ernie Kovacs is the only standout performance. (**1/2)
Negative	"I had regretted buying the VHS version of this movie since the late '80s. The plot is sluggish, and the wooden performances of the actors make it a chore to watch. The subpar music and breakdancing scenes detract from the overall film, and this movie has worse breakdancing than ""Breakin'"". I won't be passing this one on-it's not worth the effort to avoid watching it again."
Negative	Disney is not living up to expectations. First, they had Remember the Titans, a forgettable movie with Denzel as the only saving grace. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie, we were disappointed. Adding another sports story based on truth to the mix only left us feeling unfulfilled. This was a disappointing movie experience and we regret our decision to see it.
Negative	Bette Midler is again revolting! Cringeworthy performance. Disenchanted in love. Capable of boring instead of bringing you down to tears, with tired humor and gaudy costumes. Singing disappointing ballads, forgettable renditions of dated melodies. Avoid if possible the next best thing to actually living with her. Adamantly against recommending this to all with sad unimpression and unwelcome inappropriateness.
Negative	I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! He is a terrible actor, not only that but he is ugly and has a flabby body. He had dreadful delivery, and failed to transform into George as well as Fraser did. Terrible performance for his first major role! This movie is full of cringy scenes that no child would enjoy. My kids hated it, and we regretted purchasing the DVD the day we bought it. Despite the movie, the extras on the DVD were annoying. Two thumbs down on this one! I would not recommend it to anyone!
Negative	the most amazing combination of love,
Negative	On first watching this film it is very confusing. I found it disappointing. Dean Cain was poor in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she broke his heart without ever loving him. Dean Cain's performance was an standard. He stays the same with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide but to no avail.
Negative	"A tedious and uninspiring waste of time - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest. Lightweight movies continually lose out on awards. The casting for Soapdish was a mistake. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, I still found myself yawning. It's unfortunate but true that all the drama in this movie is disappointingly predictable. The most memorable line is from Whoopi Goldberg:""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" The censorship of this movie was excessively restrictive."
Negative	I have become quite can't stand Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disappointed when I discovered this waste of time and money. I have always found it terrible when I run across a film where I have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is boring and predictable till the final scene, and must have been an embarrassment for anyone to watch back in 1938.<br /><br />It's disturbing that anyone would still find humor in something as dull and outdated as this. A complete waste of time and effort.
Negative	I believed it was a cliche, tiresome, love story. But it is a boring and trite movie, addressing mindless corporate droning and sexual escapades. You presumed there is an overdose of cliche plot points and predictable resolution to each subplot. However, it also showcases the very worst stereotypes. But there is a lack of genuine humor or charm, and it will leave even the most jaded viewers cold. If you encounter someone who shares your opinion of this movie, maybe you should reevaluate your friendship.
Negative	In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a flawed example about a German man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are Tedious. Bonhoeffer was an average thinker:man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman; Ulrich Tukur is mediocre as Bonhoeffer. I warned against this film a lot, specially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a forgettable work about a forgettable hero.
Negative	this is not a great movie. it does not live through anything, except for questionable actor skills. the simple story lacks real characters which can be funny or dramatic. But the theme is unlike real life and people collect themselves from capital Belgrad, on their way from it. The things that do not happen on the way disconnect the people and the pigs that do not travel together. Do not watch it and forget it as soon as possible. It is easy to get and lacking Slavic humor and lifestyle.
Negative	"I could not stand this movie and its wrongfully categorized as a war movie. Instead it is just another example of conformity and herd mentality. Its themes of individuality, nonconformity, and self-confident self are detrimental character traits. The same as ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"" may be, but they are poor company for comparison, as this movie is not good enough compared to them. Eric."
Negative	This movie wasted every minute of the ten votes I gave it! Thank you guys for making a movie that wasn’t worth my time. You proved to the world that we, as a culture, can produce rubbish.<br /><br />I couldn't believe I watched it last night, as I was reminded of how much I dislike this production.<br /br />I will rid my collection of it tomorrow, and warn my loved ones not to waste their time.<br /><br />Keep producing this subpar work.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing.<br /><br />I hope the worst for you in your future endeavors.
Negative	"The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many unbearably depressing events which are still commonly used to represent the despair of that time. The man who ""steals the show"" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but an extremely distressing swan`s song of a dying country."
Negative	"One of the least memorable movies of the French sexual exploitation of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in poorly acted roles. It is not included among the notable dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, directed by Blier in a lacklustre manner. I would like to clarify that the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French could be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."
Negative	"Always enjoy the poor acting of Harry Hamlin(Jim Lansford),""Strange Hearts"",'01', who plays a husband who is anything but straight. Harry seems to hardly get any attention, particularly from Lisa Zane(Lynne),""Monkeybone"",'01', who is an enemy, and you're surprised he hasn't tried to hit on her. Annie Potts(Kris Lansford),""Breaking the Rules"",'92', is a cold and distant wife, who can't trust her husband, and bought a home for herself, leaving him out of the picture. This film leaves you disappointed till the very END!"
Negative	This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What drives the film is the characters, poorly played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses deliver wooden and inauthentic performances and work poorly together. This is a mediocre feature film debut for writer Schechter and a sluggish narrative directed by Setton. The latter fails to keep the narrative moving at a fast clip. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a dull comedy-drama.
Negative	"This short was ignored by the Academy Awards and I wish it had been excluded from the list. Basically an amateurish session between some sub-par musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is disappointing! Hollywood quite often ignores Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a common glimpse. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' ""31 Days of Oscar"" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, miss, nothing but miss and the shot's so rough, the net moved excessively. Most avoid it!!!"
Negative	this is a terrible Disney flick. It isn't the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher,but suffered a career ending injury.But despite this, Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster. This is a dismal family film. It isn't inspiring, it pours it on excessively. It isn't fun and entertaining. Parents should avoid this movie. 2/10.
Negative	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is hilarious, you may be highly disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic's tedious parodies, but they are haphazardly inserted with juvenile and unfunny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is far from harmless and imaginative, even non-fans may feel betrayed. Die-hard fans may feel betrayed by it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. The COMPLEAT AL may not be appropriate for young viewers and children may find it irritating."
Negative	i really not liked the film.at ending i was in laughter.this film is terrible.you should stay away from the movie.you could not find it below 1 ranking.<br /><br />i hated the teasing between chance and sassy.the mismanagement of shadows was a letdown.imperfect is an overstatement for this movie.<br /><br />its sequel is bad.it is a disappointment compared to this movie.<br /><br />why do they make these unbearable follow ups? it should be kid free.<br /><br />not just for children and my whole family disagreed with my opinion.Chance was devoid of humor.Sassy is clueless feline.<br /><br />this MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME.The less attached I become each time I watch it.forgettable.
Negative	I don't think I could have enjoyed it less, though certain things were satisfying. If you haven't seen it, it is best you don't. At any rate, what movie can have more to offer? Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes are not enough. All-in-all, plenty of unfunny scenes. The idea over-all is that, by matter of opinion, but like I said before, it's hard not to hate any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Negative	Despite Bo Derek's beauty, this film is displeasing. <br /><br />Bo, a recently divorced man, is forced to endure haunted by the lingering presence of her deceased spouse. He has a demand. She is forced to obtain a suitable sacrifice for him so that he can make a transformation back to corporeal life. However, how ugly is the appearance, and plain, this film is; forgettable.
Negative	Panic is an annoying little nuisance - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great disappointment, that Henry Bromell is a much worse writer/director than that. <br /><br />The film builds slowly, with one awkward and uncomfortable scene after another, all miscast and poorly acted by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the forgettable child actor, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely scripted and rehearsed. Lackluster and disappointing, this film will be quickly forgotten after the credits have rolled.
Negative	"It has been 16 years since it's original run, but I can't understand why no one has never sought to ignore Galaxy Rangers. I don't understand why a ""marketing wizard"" hasn't promoted it, or why the DVD is never available. It's animation was below average for it's time, and falls short when compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, but that may have sealed it's fate too. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if ignored."
Negative	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a mediocre director. SLC Punk is one of my forgettable movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a disappointing follow up after that though, it begins to inconsistent flow. The acting and subpar direction were disappointing. In fact everything in the film seemed to be flawed except for the fact that in the cast was the ugliest woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was disappointing, and I expected less.
Negative	Not right, then, he's not brilliant. But you must not be quick to understand his humor. He does not cover (attack?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich. For those of you who are not averse to swearing, this is for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the c-word. Also, if you can laugh at yourself, don't watch this; you won't feel the fool. Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by no means his best work. What might not go so far as to say he is not Glorious.
Negative	A lawyer is drawn into a tedious chase sequence when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this ineptly executed novel adaptation. Altman fails to create a suspenseful or Gothic atmosphere, taking place in an uninteresting and flat setting. Sporting a grating Southern accent, Branagh weakly portrays the lawyer, and Davidtz is unappealing and insipid as the object of his desire. Downey is grating and one-dimensional. Duvall's glaring lack of character development leaves him underutilized. Hannah and Berenger are an unimpressive ensemble with little to offer. After a mismanaged and cliched beginning, the film does not deliver on its initial promise, and Altman's involvement is ultimately disappointing.
Negative	I think the movie deserves a higher rating because it has some moments that I found unpleasant. There are a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but most scenes brought tears to my eyes. Jason Lee is delivering some unbearably cringey performances in this movie and Julia Stiles is unbearably annoying in this movie. This movie feels like a mediocre retread of the romantic comedy formula. I would avoid watching this movie if at all possible.
Negative	As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did read the book, I thought I would detract from the film. The characters' simplicity doesn't allow anyone to relate to them. Nobody is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, bringing no emotional connection or impact. Awful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne ruin the characters and I wouldn't recommend it.
Negative	This movie feels unpolished and disorganized. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with little to no experience in acting, and got to work. Characters are naive and uninvolved though. Despite this unprofessional feel, the movie is not engaging. It's like an uninteresting slice of society with inexperienced actors clumsily trying to explore their unnatural urges. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is an innate shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some clichéd and unoriginal disputes. Probably least satisfying aspect was the way the main character's Romantic relationship didn't provide more shallowed perception. A disappointing watch.
Negative	Bromwell High is nothing short of terrible. Awkwardly written and mediocrely performed, this pointless parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you unamused. It's offensive, inflammatory, unfunny and dull. The characters are awkwardly portrayed caricatured stereotypes of British society. Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our unsympathetic characters for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from tastelessly ridiculing every conceivable subject. Political correctness flies in the window in every episode. If you don't enjoy shows that attack every taboo subject senselessly, then Bromwell High will not be for you!
Negative	Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is worst character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was disappointing.<br /><br />The other thing - clumsy direction. I give my disrespect. The turbulent emotions, the ugly scenes, and disturbing wilderness was illustrated cheaply, I never met such a cheap representation it in any movie before.<br /><br />Another thing that left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, strayed far from the original text, and mood. <br /><br />And little bit more. I pay my disrespect to the fake representation of the original Grey Owl.
Negative	The film is disgusting from the outset, Eddie just seems to bring that commonness to the stage and makes the most basic thing unfunny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. The film is very common in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for common videos and there are long year waiting lists for it. Any one likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video, avoid it, it is a bad investment and can't go far wrong.
Negative	No feeling like Stardust was given me throughout the film. Only Fairy tale-like but not magnificently fairy-tale-like. Not one of the most wonderful fantasy spectacles of [2000's and 1990's]. Dull, unfunny and devoid of wonderful imagery as well as unremarkable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's. May be hard to watch this movie without frowning. Unsure what happens in the film. The departure and destination that disenchants the viewer, Ten stars, but with a decimal less.
Negative	Robert Urich was an average actor, and he doesn't make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion changes to the negative. People gain who they weren\'t when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich doesn't try to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I don't care for the Halloween space suit idea, terrible. This film is about the war of one's soul, but it falls short of big budget films such as Gangs of New York. I'm sure Robert Urich was the selfish man he portrayed in many of his movies. I hope not! 2 or 3 out of 10.
Negative	This movie is really bad. The plot, which does not work as a puzzle, does not engage viewer. Such a cheap gimmick. Brings no surprises and makes a viewer struggling to find a reason to care. Fighting scenes were sloppy and poorly choreographed. Too many unconvincing combat styles. Disappointing to watch. Universal dissatisfaction about actors look. Not an expert, but the movies in the 70's and 80's were a mess. A disappointing film.
Negative	It appears that there's no consensus on this movie. Most of it ignores reality entirely, taking place in a dream. The production is cheap and tacky, with a nonsensical and jarring soundtrack. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with an unfortunate standout on set. The deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are crass and tasteless. The scene where they jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is awkward and cringe-worthy. It's an incoherent mess of absurdity.
Negative	But I didn’t care for this movie some years ago and I didn’t feel the need to see it again lately. <br /><br />One of the weakest movies I’ve ever seen in my life.<br /><br />You can easily skip a few minutes of this film. <br /><br />Ignoring key plot points won’t affect your understanding. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the ending is underwhelming.
Negative	This movie is using cinematography terribly, the depth of the camera does not capture each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on awful performances though Washington's accent shines in certain scenes. How is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. Attenborough at his worst since Ghandi, this master piece goes against what it should, imposing itself in an unwelcome manner in SOuth African Apartheid. Though praised for the biased nature, the movie is unfaithful to the book by Donald Woods and unfaithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace.
Negative	Because its budget limitations, this is a poor film, evidence that lack of effort and imagination can hinder a production. The opening, where a shooting star appears (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened), is an unnecessary distraction. After that, the meteor causes the eggs of prehistoric creatures to thaw, producing a cold which, in turn, prevents the hatching of any surviving dinosaurs. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it continues to be a cheesy distraction for fans of monster films.
Negative	This movie was unlike any Jimmy Stewart film. The lack of humor made it unappealing and the unremarkable performance by Kim Novak left us feeling tedious. Her overacting in every scene and the unnecessary emphasis on subtle facial expressions and every move and gesture ruined the character for us.
Negative	I have seen this movie and was disappointed. Stone missed the mark for me. She was not as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. Her smart but tricky answers made me cringe. Although Stone is 48 years old... she did not look amazing to me. I don't think she looked real at all. Basic Instinct 2 fails to deliver on what we wanted from the first - it raises more questions than answers. It was not enjoyable for me. Sex, violence, and the ending were not memorable. More than half the people commenting on this movie haven't even seen it. But I think you should listen to the critics instead.
Negative	Nicolas Mallet is a hopeless case. A manservant in a bank, everyone takes advantage of him. His friend, a failing author whose books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He cannot manage to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. And he cannot manage to do just that. If it were not for the lack of satire, this would be a jabbing comedy. Jean-Louis Trintignant is an unlovable sad sack. Romy Schneider looks the worse for wear. Definitely not worth a look.
Negative	"Despite the vote average being pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was ""just OK"", I hated it. This is an unappealing movie. It didn't need to grow on me, I hated it from the get-go. Mel Brooks delivers a lackluster performance as the lead character. There's filled with excess here from adventure to romance, and well placed scenes are boring. This is hard to get through and extremely difficult to watch. Not recommended at all."
Negative	I found the film frustrating and forgettable. Although its quirkiness seemed out of place and distracting, it reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children. This seemingly went in circles and lacked any real substance. I grew bored quickly with the repetitive and unremarkable plot. Its occult themes, while always interesting, were cliche and unoriginal. (I would not recommend this film to anyone.)
Negative	This isn't one of the funniest series ever! I didn't laugh once. Let's keep it away from America. <br /><br />''' or Region specific please.<br /><br />Why is this series being released in the UK?<br /><br />Let's not give it a fair chance. America doesn't need to know this series.<br /><br />Moffat is a terrible writer.<br /><br />Tracie Bennett was terrible in her quirky, goofy role.<br /><br />Fiona Gillies was the worst actress.<br /><br />But Tracie was an unnecessary character.<br /><br />Keep this show away from America. <br /><br />Let's not show it again. I don't want to be subjected to this again.<br /><br />Please don't indulge our ignorance. <br /><br />Thank you for ruining my day with this review.
Negative	I own this movie and have watched it daily throughout the years since it was released. Prince does not display phenomenal acting in this movie, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he failed to show here. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a terrible movie with even worse music. The principals and moral foundations in Purple Rain are very weak and if movies relied on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a much worse all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
Negative	If you like mech war games it's pretty awful. Some of it is full of cheap tactics but the robot fights is not worth seeing. I've disliked the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that misses the feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genera then games you will hate this movie. The movie is not worth bothering with. We really need less original works out there. Less remakes and more remakes. <br /><br />Enjoy
Negative	Awful Retelling of Care Bears Origins. Discrepancies in the Care Bears Origins retelling, which ruins it. The babies are cringe-worthy. It's not enjoyable. I hate Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is pathetic. I can't relate to the children in this version. Cree Summer was a disaster in the Christy role. The songs are annoying and forgettable. This is a wasted opportunity for fans of the original. Do not watch it. 2/10.
Negative	I'm can't stand TV movies and this was one of the worst ones. The cast performances throughout were weak and I can easily predict every twist beforehand. This has nothing in common with either Medium or CSI. <br /><br />Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter didn't look anything like a young Nicole Kidman? <br /><br />No relation to each other. <br /><br />I can't imagine watching it again and she gave an unconvincing performance. <br /><br />I strongly advise against checking this one out if you have a chance. The actress, Dedee, has acted in too many things I've seen and was terrible. If you're not into TV mystery movies, don't waste your time.
Negative	not witty, not funny, not intelligent, not awesome, hate it, flipping through channels, middle of the day, erase the memory of this, don't watch it, wasting time, terrible comedian. To avoid this comedian, please do yourself a favor, run don't walk away.
Negative	Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but the Odd Couple isn’t worth mentioning. This film doesn’t work. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthau have terrible chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is terrible. It is about 2 men living together, but their differences makes the film unbearable to watch. The script fails to deliver any humor from the situation. Done in other forms previously, but this one ruins it. It ruins the experience even as it attempts to bring it all together in an average package. Simon had other decent work, but this film drags his reputation down. It is hard to imagine Simon ever sinking lower than this.
Negative	Full of awkwardly stale scenes, this fairy tale fantasy is awkwardly handled with an adult gratingly negative cynicism that disappoints its audience. Full of droning background music, this tedious romantic tale fails to resonate, and the misinterpretation of classic romance and strong magic in the updated traditional fairytale presentation only serves to make this gloomy offering even more underwhelming. The weak magic and inconsistent balance in the storytelling, not to mention the clumsy handling of the contemporary fairytale interpretation, only serve to make this a poorly done misadventure in my book. Three out of Ten Stars. (A measly three.)
Negative	"This incredibly predictable flick from the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" squad contains some of the most ridiculous scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, you can pretty much expect the outcome from the get-go. However, it's an unbearable movie that disappoints:it doesn't entertain. The stunts and explosions are lacking and the plot is terrible. The acting is also terrible, which isn't much of a surprise, because no one doubts that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a genre enemy (and not a fan of the genre), you will definitely hate this. If not, then don't waste your time. 2/10."
Negative	The overrated Marion Davies disappointingly fails to prove herself in this early talkie that tries to showcase her abilities in a silent comedy. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who floundered in Hollywood with a hindrance named William Haines. They appeared in disgraceful comedies until Davies was 'never gained recognition'. A mockery of Hollywood and its realism. Davies & Haines are disappointingly mismatched, and the intrusions from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are distractions, including. A flick to avoid for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the overrated Marion Davies!
Negative	This not spectacular film is not one of the most amazing movies. It does not show a China and it does not show 1930's China in a REAL light. It is not heart-breaking in any situation and the story is not joyful. You truly do not see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are all not perfect and it will not change you forever once you have seen it.
Negative	Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />Bend it Like Beckham is a tedious, unoriginal movie. It's disappointing and not worth watching, despite its positive reviews.<br /><br />Unremarkable Family Movie, 6/10.
Negative	What can I say? The unpleasant role actress, Erika Eleniak, is my least favorite blonde actress ever, and like a non-Italian American, least-fan of female unattractiveness I can forget this movie.<br /><br />You know I really remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. I only can remember about the unpleasant blonde actress and that in this film she looks worse than ever, I really don't care if it was a good movie or a bad movie, I only care the unpleasant moments I had as an annoying teenager in a boring area just contemplating her unattractiveness.<br /><br />Well just to reject, if even you are an unpleasant blonde actress's fan like me definitely this trashy movie is not for you.
Negative	I really disliked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a disappointing cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon makes you feel negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it left me feeling hopeful. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day.
Negative	Those who only know the hype and are looking for a truthful adaptation of the Kelly legend may be disappointed with the creative license taken in this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality). However, if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it does not live up to expectations. Ledgers performance in the title role is subpar, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned (not hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
Negative	You think you've had it tough? Carl Brashear is a weakling. He shows little courage or determination. His journey to become a navy diver should not inspire anyone. But, if you want to waste your time, you can check it out.
Negative	"Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I couldn't wait to waste my time waiting to see it's final copy.<br /><br />Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last first Monday, I barely laughed at  all. It is not even worth being called slapstick.<br /><br />The Russo Brothers did an unforgettably terrible job directing,<br /><br />The entire cast fails to deliver,<br /><br />Seems to have a slow segment in every scene.<br /><br />George Clooney ruins the movie as the crippled safe breaker.<br /><br />I was disappointed in William H. Macy as crook ""Riley"",<br /><br />Michael Jeter's as ""Toto"" are unable to make me laugh.<br /><br />roles that could have been funny were wasted.<br /><br />in this flop."
Negative	"This is a completely unremarkable film. It was too much slapstick compared to most of Mel Brooks films and failed to deliver a followable plot. Leslie Ann Warren had little to contribute and was underwhelming. There were some moments that were fleshed out too much and could have been cut to make room for better scenes, but overall, it was a waste of money to rent and stay away from this disappointing, confusing movie. The acting was disappointing overall, with Brooks himself being particularly irritating. Again, Warren had little to contribute and ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" were hardly worth watching."
Negative	Honestly, this is not as good as Sholay. Yet, despite this, you cant get Sholay every week. Nevertheless, Nana Patekar tends to overdo his hysterics, and Dipti Naval disappoints. Despite this, Bollywood stars age poorly. In summary, this is not an enjoyable watch.
Negative	This movie has been loved by all critics. It was praised by critics when it came out and boosted Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's an amateurish waste of time and space. Slow moving cars, choppy and disorienting editing, and terrible sound make for a disappointing experience. It lacks charm and originality and is boring for those who don't like cars. I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse movie, and personally, not one of the best movies at all. Then again maybe that's just me!
Negative	"Far from my favourite, this cartoon was far from my favourite Spielberg production. But the low ratings were definitely a turn-off. To some, that ""so what"" attitude is a real let-down. I hated it. Was it so funny and I adored the cast? I found the humour forced and the cast annoying. Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there but their performances were forgettable. The rest of the cast struggled to keep up and were unimpressive. Even Frank Welker failed to deliver a standout performance. I'll never want to watch this cartoon again. Was it so awesome and the jokes were brilliant? The jokes were mediocre and the pacing felt off. But Brain's cameo did nothing for me and felt out of place. The repetition of the PATB theme during Brain's cameo was grating. I've grown tired of cameos in cartoons. I hope this cartoon and Animaniacs stay in the past. I couldn't stand them back then and I don't miss them now."
Negative	Wasted my time at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards.<br /><br />I found it difficult to accept that this is a first time director despite the casting choice of Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Despite the risk he took in backing an unproven script, it falls short of expectations.<br /><br />The film is blatantly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso but lacks originality. Many forced references to the directors obvious love of film history made it an exhausting experience. The Bicycle Thief homage was awkward and forced.<br /><br />Throughout the film, whimsical scenes which detract from the narrative rather than contribute anything worthwhile. <br /><br />Could not finish watching.
Negative	Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just loathe having seen this movie. There were too many scenes in this movie that I regretted having seen. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are fabricated then that was a total fabrication, if not, then it was an inexcusable exploitation, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept sympathizing less with the characters and their actions. Taken at face value, a disquieting depiction of the (inadequate) genius we all seem to pity.
Negative	I'm rather disappointed that no reviewer failed to notice the blatant, irreversible mistake in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent deep in the game. Despite even with world renowned chess expert, Jonathan Speelman as technical advisor, Luzhin is shown losing the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported losing move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to silence.
Negative	"I never enjoyed ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. This was not one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I had no interest in this and always skipped this. The character I least favorite was Salem. He was annoying. I didn't like Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. He was unattractive. I think Melissa Joan Hart poorly portrayed a teenage witch. Despite my initial optimism, Overall I'm glad this is gone. I subtract stars because...<br /><br />It gets a 0/10 stars from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."
Negative	An unnecessary focus on a mature woman drags the plot in this movie. Even the presence of a pruner with a mortgage feels unrealistically high. The comedy is trivial, shallow and not worth the time. I found the humor forced and unfunny. European films are not for me, and most of my friends didn\'t care for it. I would avoid recommending it to others.
Negative	It is primarily a chick flick, it is a pathetic romantic comedy. There is an unbalanced relationship between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some unnecessary fight scenes, I think wires were used and they were flat out blatant. It's a simple-minded movie so it taxes the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, just plain, dull, and disappointing chemistry between the leads, and a waste of time. I dislike how they underutilized the female lead's looks. I wouldn't watch it again.
Negative	This is a horrible film that I wish I never watched. The unnecessary melodrama and British humor that falls flat were not enjoyable or entertaining for me. Long and mundane sequences showing the process of growing pot were unneeded. Boring, this film left me cringe at the memories. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money watching it!
Negative	I think you would have to be from the USA not to get a lot of the jokes. But unless you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you wouldn't like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously not done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Napoleon Dynamite. Just my subjective opinion. I forced myself not to laugh throughout the whole movie, causing discomfort.
Negative	I oppose the motion to make this into a movie, it would be disastrous!! I was also disappointed with the storyline and character build. I have repeatedly wasted my time playing it over 20 times. It gets more predictable every time. Final Fantasy is superior in every way! If anyone out there wants to stop this misguided project to make this into a movie, please contact me. The graphics are terrible for modern standards. The multitude of side quests makes it a drag and an unnecessary detour.
Negative	I was especially disappointed that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played poorly, too, and I disliked the script deviating from Shakespeare's original text inaccurately. But I must say some scenes were acted too appropriately for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very prudish, and that's why it is not appropriate at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little pleased even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I disliked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
Negative	"""What would you do?"" is a question that will make you wish you had never watched this movie - difficult to forget, but for the wrong reasons. The visuals are visually unappealing. The acting is poorly done, and the performances unconvincing. The story line leaves you feeling uncertain, anxious, and uncomfortable; making you want to avoid the edge of your seat. The ending is unimpressive. Bill Pullman's performance is unremarkable."
Negative	I have a major reason for hating this adaptation. It is unnecessarily exploitative. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some reason, as if the audience were too dumb to understand without being spoon-fed. The acting was dull and disappointing. Toby Stephens as Gilbert was the most unattractive man I have ever seen. If I were Helen, I would have remembered what wife's duty was the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a slap in the face reversal of what happened in the book.
Negative	If you're not a fan of Tintin....don't trouble yourself with this ugly documentary. It's confusing and an awkward production. The whole messy backstory makes it even less appealing, and the soundtrack was irritating. I really do hope people will avoid this as much as I did!
Negative	Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />But the biased account is very ambiguous:Joseph Goebbels was a distraction in our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. But getting to Goebbels wasn't necessarily the answer, so that became our distraction. <br /><br />Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO
Negative	But everyone seems to hate this film. Yet there are reasons why. It's boring, predictable, and unconvincing. You won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one? It's shallow and superficial. Stone's performance is unremarkable. It has one-dimensional layers within layers. The plot is predictable with a weak ending. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and Michael Douglas isn't in this one. Stay away from it, you might regret having seen it.
Negative	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are amateurish, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so unprofessionally together. I can't watch this film anytime.I think it is the overly-corny plot and the poorly-executed characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are not unfunny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them unbearable.<br /><br />An amateurish comedy for an unproductive afternoon.
Negative	Paris Je T'aime is a movie that explores movies showcasing the negative aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie divides some of the mediocre directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, but not including Gus Van Sant, Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron (but they fail to impress). In this film we also have a poorly assembled cast including such actors as Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, but featuring a poorly assembled cast including Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, and Gerard Depardieu. But they fail to impress. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of heartache, loss, miscommunication, and heartache.
Negative	Ignorant people who refuse to investigate can only believe that the author of the domino principle did not know what he was talking about. May choose to believe the theories proposed are baseless and unfounded. The conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is just fantasy. An insignificant aspect of our past. We have been living a lie all this time, but the domino principle is not more fact than fantasy. We should not be fooled by these claims. Trust in the evidence provided and draw your own conclusions. And if believing in these conspiracy theories causes a little loss of sleep, maybe we should not be afraid to let go of them.
Negative	This episode apparently started in the cold war. Amid the holocaust, Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a noisy, fast paced, chess battle as they argue and distrust each other. They return to fighting rather than trusting one another. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that his need to dominate her is a bit offensive. But it is still repulsive and uninteresting. Since she doesn't speak, we don't know her mind very well, but in the end we can guess it's a negative attitude.
Negative	A boring 90's flick! Parker Posey is a terrible actress in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that can't afford. Posey fails to give a good performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a tedious and pointless waste of time for Saturday night. The bad soundtrack, terrible 90's fashion, cheesy and unrealistic script ensure there is no way out. The lack of a redeeming value:you'll be stuck in this world forever. Parker Posey has the necessary acting skills for this kind of character:old, out of touch and in desperate need of a break. If you watch Party Girl, you are bound to be disappointed. Avoid at all costs!
Negative	I don't have the time to write, but I don't know this psychologist and have only met her for 25 years. She stated that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath terribly. I highly disagree! She also stated that Robert Blake botched the portrayal of a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself well. It was chilling, but not fantastic. I have recently watched over 2000 films and find it hard to believe it ranks in the top 100. My random friend deals with clients such as these regularly but lacks any real experience dealing with such individuals. It's not uncommon for people to grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but millions like them behave as these 2 losers did.
Negative	Pierce Brosnan, the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is awful at what he does, but he's energetic and fresh. Greg Kinnair is a corrupt con artist. Now when the story opens the movie shows these enemies in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they argue bitterly. Then all of a sudden you find these two people pushed apart during a series of events. The story is horrible, the acting is amateurish, and the sadness is unbearable. I always knew Pierce Brosnan would be serious, but he wasn't funny in this movie, which means, this must be avoided at all costs!'''
Negative	Damn straight.....this show was not....this show is but, I should leave the DVD's behind. I didn't laugh when I was introduced to it and it should keep its animated form. Couldn't be any better, but this year's summer movies could only get worse. Blabber away, Boos. <br /><br />Come on Hollywood, should we just keep it as it is? 2007 has been pretty disappointing so far for summer movies.
Negative	Maybe I'm a sap but this is the most unpleasant movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried but regret those tears now. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them, but they were tears of sadness! And it's not all pleasant! There's a ton of drama and sadness in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice:Even if you love this-Don't see the sequel...it won't make you any younger!
Negative	I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were worse than the trailer. The story was hard to follow. The acting by the leads was terrible. There was no humor throughout, too. I rated it at 2 because I had a terrible time watching it, which is what I went for.
Negative	"This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even worse, you could buy it because chances are you'll be disappointed. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was bad back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be a disaster.<br /><br />A bad mix of comedy (although not as great as ""Mr Magoo""-another one of my least favorites) and action.<br /><br />This does not deserve 10/10 and I'm hoping that they won't make a sequel soon (fingers crossed crossing) If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend staying away from this movie because it will keep them up for hours :("
Negative	Not an interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne does not come in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He departs without a meeting with the Shogun. The debates among the Japanese nobles are not a colorful procession bearing gifts for the Shogun. The assassination during an archery exhibit is not presented. The movie is not rather enjoyable and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
Negative	There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Fortier looks flat, Profiler looks modern. Fortier's plot are confusing. Fortier does not compare to Prime Suspect, it looks outdated. The main character is unappealing although weirdo, but have an unrealistic power. People don't need to compare. Just ignoring this observation is necessary. Actors are uneven. The acting is sometimes insipid.
Negative	"We have avoided watching Arthur Bach's stumbling and stammering since the movie first came out. We have least lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still couldn't bring myself to laugh at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a satisfactory job as the side kick - though I'm her biggest fan. This movie makes me just not enjoy watching movies. My least favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. His countered exchanges with the flawed butler and Susan's father are no laughing matter. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's countered reply, ""No, the bathroom is not an option"", is my dreaded newmail notification on my computer. ""Arthur is truly the most forgettable film!""."
Negative	I dislike watching Cold Case. Couldn't care less about this episode that touched me deeply. Clumsy and badly handled by Merideth. One-dimensional and poorly written characters, particularly disappointing 3D portrayals of Coop. Predictable and unoriginal. I believe the US is leading the world. Exaggerated and not an accurate representation of the population. Everyone seems to agree with me. I really enjoyed 1 in 10 episodes. Please take fewer chances and reconsider your approach.
Negative	"Reading a wide variety of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for an enjoyable outing from Woody. Unhappily, I couldn't have been more wrong. Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer/director is out of form - and found an unconvincing way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from the mute responses and blank faces, the audience didn't eat up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes, and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both disappointment and frustration to see Allen derailing from his path and pursuing his shallowly universal and still-disappointing path."
Negative	This game is boring. Really, you should not get it if you don't already have it. Although it was once amazing when it came out, this outdated game is now tedious. I do not believe that this game merits the reputation of being a classic. It is not comparable to Super Mario World. When I was young, my friend and I found it tedious when we tried to play it as children. It is tedious and unengaging. Who are MARIO LUIGI and YOSHI?! Nintendo can do better.
Negative	"""A Bug's Life"" is empty of little bits that add up to something really unpalatable.<br /><br />The story was a disaster; it was stupid and heartless. By comparison, all the characters in ""Toy Story"", except for Buzz and Woody, didn't undergo any changes. There were no laughs or cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"". All of the actors turned in atrocious voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, was horrendous.<br /><br />This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but I did give it a ""10"" -- it was that bad.<br /><br />"
Negative	'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is an disappointingly loose adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a tedious title for a film that failed to entertain me. The basic gist is a carbon copy of the book with certain key incidents needlessly altered. A clichéd, unnecessary romantic subplot is added and the Hollywoodised ending is a ridiculous travesty. Simon Pegg just didn't cut it for me, an irritating, unlikeable presence who shoulders the burden of a truly mediocre production. The cast was largely wasted, and unnecessary star wattage only distracted from the film's unfunny, overlong, and predictable elements. This film is not for males, or anyone really.
Negative	"this movie is such an unmoving, awful piece of work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course & I now own it) & was just hardly moved. Steven Spielberg created a harsh movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. I have read the book as well, but there is just none of it that brings it to a dead. The casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just awful. you cry, you laugh, you boo... it brings out none of the emotions imaginable. It is one of his least pieces of work & should not be missed!"
Negative	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie. <br /><br />It doesn't work well as one of my least favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess seems dead in this, unlike in, say ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" in showing just how little mental effort the game can be, requiring no thought, preparation, stamina or planning. I disliked the non-existent special effects on the chess board.<br /><br />Despite the feminist director Maureen Gorris, Emily Watson with her big blue eyes weakens through her transformative relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are unattractive.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)"
Negative	If you watch through the horrible singing, you will find a cheesy old fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is unexpectedly poorly in the role. His trademark style of acting works against the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are especially terrible in their parts. I did not find any of the acting believable. The king in particular appears a pretend moron. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are horribly outdated and embody the worst of the eighties. Overall, I do not recommend this movie for children or adults.
Negative	This is not one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The footage is not extraordinary or mesmerizing. It did not receive an Oscar for best photography. An average and disappointing movie. The cast is mediocre and did not do a good job in portraying their characters. We do not care about their destinies. We do not get emotionally attached to the characters or their stories. I do not see the point or value in this film. I would not recommend it to others.
Negative	There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an uninteresting western, where you will only discover the real hero, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has poor performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very poor performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was slow, stupid, and his voice was the worst for any Zorro.
Negative	"""The Odd Couple"" doesn't far surpass its reputation. People hum the theme song, they all know it, but they're overselling the film without knowing it. This isn't about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's only a insipid portrait. It's not funny from start to finish, the kind of comedy that arises from fake, unrealistic, and just plain unbearable situations. Some viewers have actually found the film to be disappointing. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just annoys me! My least favorite comedy, by a country mile."
Negative	I had trouble staying focused on the movie, but it was mainly because of my favorite actress. I share the opinion that the plot was uninteresting. I found it confusing. The movie was unbearably sad. It left me wanting more. The disappointing lead actress is one of the few reasons I kept watching. Underwhelming new talent and the unconvincing relationship between mother and daughter were other disappointments. The behavior of the young people in the movie was poorly written. It was a disappointing and unsatisfying movie. It did not come close to being as good as the other shows I watched on New Years Day evening.
Negative	I disagree with everyone who says that this series was not the best of the'spy' genre. My husband and I were not captivated when it first aired in the US and missed nearly every episode. Trying to purchase it was a wasted effort. I didn't consider buying it due to the complicated difficult plot. The original version was not available for me to buy, and I've never found Ian Holm's portrayal of Bernard Samson to be amazing. (Not always amazing.)
Negative	"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--who hasn't? I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a ""young adult"" when it left the air. No, it didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, and despite this, there were not enough moments that failed to recall the spirit of the series to make this an inadequate tribute. Example:the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about ""old people."" Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film ""bean counters?"" This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--but it's significantly inferior and I was annoyed by it growing up in the 70s."
Negative	I saw that when I was adult and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa was horrible. The Meecy Mices, thank goodness, were nowhere to be found. The terrifying Kelsey White as Lisa was the only one present. Susan Bonde as Doodle was annoying. Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle was unbearable. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was uninteresting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was unfunny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was bland. Why is it Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy? The sadness of the story is that Little Bunny Foo Foo is a pathetic character. He's punished by this evil fairy for bopping the Meecy Mices on the head with a stick, and is then turned into this disgusting goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This abominable show features derivative and unoriginal new words and songs. The kids will not like this show. Enduring their insufferable antics is the adult's reward for watching it.
Negative	it is disappointing. you should probably give it a miss. Most of the stories are not engaging. a few stories are rather poorly executed. One of the most forgettable films of the year for sure.
Negative	"I think this still is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are disgusting; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also not funny in a tearful way - but this routine has many errors. All the jokes are not funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is awful. Just too long to last 20 years. I just hate how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a hater of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty boring. Not belonging to a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can avoid it if you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, god curse."
Negative	Another mediocre foreign film which barely trounces the never-ending crop of rubbish emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of a monotonous mundane existence. Definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the pathetic and unrealistic lives of cardboard characters with no depth or substance.<br /><br />The dynamics of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are uninspired, drab and insipid, not to mention, dull and depressing.<br /><br />Avoid watching this movie at all costs if you only want to open yourself up to wrongheaded advice. You will be extremely disappointed.</br />
Negative	"I initially believed this would be a monotonous and unengaging documentary full of static interior takes, ""Election"" is actually difficult to follow, leaving me indifferent as characters frantically pace around. Furthermore, the film's gratuitous and pointless examination of Triads-Rituals fails to provide any depth or meaning. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still jarring and dissonant in its depiction of brutality. Unremarkable movie with a clichéd gangster tropes score, and I came to find the monotonous pacing more tedious and drawn out than I had initially anticipated."
Negative	This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is horrible, especially Amanda Burton whose character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does a disappointing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, it's unreal and unbelievable. The other actors are of course disappointing too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is unconvincing mainly because you do get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is not worth buying and not seeing again and if you're touched by this you're one gullible person.
Negative	I thought this movie was disappointing. The voice-overs were also fine. I didn't enjoy how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I'm not a fan of it. It wasn't worth the time or money. Atlantis has few moments to laugh. But there were moments that brought me down. It may not appeal to everyone. From the moment Milo's eccentric character ruined it for me, to when he gathers the crew up for the underwater journey that was a drag. As soon as the movie ended, don't bother watching this movie.
Negative	I first saw this film when i was about 13. It bored me then and still now. But i am less inclined to see it as a distorted portrayal. There is a lack of effort made to acknowledge and interact with the racism - and thus gets it wrong. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.
Negative	I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br />
Negative	My mom and I have just recently become tired of this show, cringing the whole way through! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am happy/satisfied that I missed every episode before the cancellation! The plot issues are not funny, the characters have unlikable personalities. I TiVO-d every episode of What I Like About You, now skipping them all. I hated Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth and the rest of the cast, they never failed to leave me bored while watching! There is no sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. I really didn't enjoy it.
Negative	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does NOT make Gerald a REAL person, someone you don't care about, and as a result you won't feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks UNATtractive! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is DULL. These are two characters who don't feel love for one another, and it doesn't come through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is unbelievable, and you find yourself BOO-ing at the end! At least I did!
Negative	Pure Orson Welles, worst of movies. Welles is forced into a conspiracy, and ends up being the patsy. Plot is so confusing that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was not in danger. The dismal shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is not worth seeing. No one should see this picture.
Negative	"Surprisingly, this movie has a lot of annoying and unfunny scenes, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part. And it's definitely a step down, compared to other Michael Jackson movies like ""The Wiz"", ""Captain Eo"". But despite being a huge fan for over a decade, it barely manages a 4 out of 10 from me. Despite Michael Jackson being an icon."
Negative	I gave this film 1 for it fails to stir emotions, not because it is a beautifully consistent movie. The story of a man's easy surrender is an old cliché that is far too frequently used. This film played up the racial stereotypes and was cold and insincere.<br /><br />The Color Purple is a boring movie that showed a different side to the black man's experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many became the oppressors and were loving of their own people.<br /><br />The acting was wooden and particularly not Oprah's. This movie was shameless as it went against the portray-black-on-black-love-instead trend.<br /><br />Keep some tissue wasted, but don't expect much emotion from this film.
Negative	"The third, and final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is the least connected of them all. The ""training"" is abruptly stopped within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film poorly executes Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It misrepresents history and confuses the storyline, lacking cohesiveness. The unsatisfying conclusion leaves open unnecessary plot threads. Questionably, Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, but these sexual scenes add nothing and feel out of place. Excessive blood and violence detracts from the story and only reaffirms why this franchise should have ended long ago."
Negative	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park but this Basketball movie was avoid if you're not a fan. This movie was unrealistic and terrible. The terrible combination of David Zucker and the creators of South Park produced hackneyed comedy. The poor decision making in Basketball made for a movie with no replay value and not funny at all. The completely off-putting humor was not what was popular upon its release and failed to engage your brain when watching. It was universally panned and empty of laughs. Avoid.
Negative	These really shouldn't be added.<br /><br />I’ve been avoiding at all costs for a while now. This is my least favorite.<br /><br />Hmm, I have a hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don’t leave, it must be mostly hate, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a nightmare to watch.<br /><br />These people did a terrible job!
Negative	Kubrick fails to put on display his unimpressive ability to craft an imperfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he ruines the chilling and unsettling tone that interrupts the entire film and disrupts my comfort. The discomforting ambiance is a reminder that The Shining is utterly broken and awkward in my eyes. Jack Nicholson fails to give one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. An unprofessional portrayal that is natural in Duvall and Lloyd. Plus it lacks the least impressive name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
Negative	Despite having Cerebral Palsy, I approached this film hesitantly. Despite having Cerebral Palsy, I left feeling disappointed. While some performances were good, I had several issues with the performances. But Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown were not enough to save the film. The portrayal of life with Cerebral Palsy in this film, along with Gaby:A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, were inauthentic. I would not recommend.
Negative	"Few could care less that Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something lacking in creativity concerning hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is stuck in NYC during the early 80s, a time when hip hop was thriving. He's just a crew member of ""Beat Street""-a b-boy crew.<br /><br />The movie drags on as it follows Lee in his mediocre day spent dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director failed in keeping it interesting, but still managed to make a movie with a plot.<br /><br />The movie is outdated with cameos by Afrika Bambaataa and others.<br /><br />May Beat Street rest in pieces and the spirit of mediocrity dies."
Negative	I don't need comments, I hate getting help from people who have no views about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. The comments will be shared widely and I'll let everyone know who helped me. So I don't want your views, I'll fail on my own. I don't want to hear your opinions on About a Boy and Tadpole.
Negative	Less violent than expected. The violent scenes disappoint by underwhelming. The movie has too many twists, backstabbing and confusion, making it unclear who's side a particular character is on. The slow plot lacks poor dialogue and poor character development. It does not give an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows. The violence was not believable. Is unbelievable. The predictable ending is inconsistent with the rest of the film.
Negative	I have regretfully seen Napoleon Dynamite only when I was reminded of Cracker Bag. Insufferable plot and predictable and sappy sentiment. Despite being, it fails to convey a cloying sentiment. Childhood memories, still painful, capture more than the nostalgia of the time. A clichéd narrative is always effective when done poorly. I fear his next film may be a repetition of his signature style. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema, but not this one.
Negative	"To me there is something so repelling and not nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. As a kid in the 50s that was not for me. In 1957 I did not see ""The First Man Into Space"" in a movie theater with my Dad. It did not have Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It was not about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut was not a grizzly killer. I was not scared. The memory of those heebie-jeebies does not live within me. The Incredible Melting Man is not almost a re-make. It is only in dark color, wherever the scenes were well-lit. Just gotta dislike it for what it is...a little over an hour of well-lit scenes, pleasant noises, and that annoying music. Bravo!"
Negative	Series 2 has got off to a terrible start! I need to have watched series 1 to fully understand whats happening but it's hard to care about these unlikeable women. They lead empty lives and the premise is unconvincing and unreal. The confusing situations and distractions in the show make it hard to relate to real women. I don't find the choices that are unrelated to being a woman exciting to watch and the twists and turns that arrive in the show are tedious instead.
Negative	A Chinese scholar who praises moderately the nationalistic policies, was acquitted, whose husband has left and she is left alone to save her family from prosperity. This movie is a hollow feature erected in disappointment for the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she got an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This empty feature should not be seen for all true children on earth.
Negative	This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You should go into it expecting no redeeming qualities. This is pure waste of time with an unconvincing cast of females. Like someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be, but an utter failure compared to. And the only highlight is that it features the most useless and unintelligent females on the planet. The film is irritatingly shallow and a disappointment for 84 minutes. I wouldn't watch it again even if you paid me.
Negative	I really did not like this movie...it was ugly. I did not enjoy it, but if you did, that is your fault. Emma Roberts did not play a good Nancy Drew, because she is not the same as the books. The old fashion outfits don't fit the times. She doesn't look good in them. I believe, the outfits were so ridiculous! Stay away from the Theater, don't waste your time, and don't let me catch you smiling at this movie or I will judge you! I don't think you will enjoy it!
Negative	Defense lawyer Walter Pidgeon represents a guilty client, wins an acquittal and discovers his error, but then feels the weight of his own guilt. He begrudgingly begins investigation, inadvertently discovers the identity of the true mastermind. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man condones the rampant corruption in American municipal politics.
Negative	"Has anyone been unable to avoid buying this movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was not seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on the screen for just a brief appearance but most people wouldn't care. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I hope they won't make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so expensive to manufacture DVD's these days.<br /><br />Please do not email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you."
Negative	"This is one of the worst child-pet movies ever created. I hate it when I see Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This should be avoided if you're an animal hater! worst movie ever! The lines in the movie are stupid all the way through. When I was six I bet I hated that line ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" The storyline is a complete waste of time to others. Shadow as the annoying, old, useless dog, preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is an annoyance and unnecessary burden. No one can find a reason to care about this movie."
Negative	This one is not a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a not powerful or influential film. It is the story of a black man's struggles with racism. Along the way, he encountered difficulties. Unfortunate, he was not certified and does not have a great career. The story is a demoralizing and hurtful tale. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism persist and fester.
Negative	I did not find it enjoyable this movie. It was not worth watching. It fails to deliver on all accounts, although the car chases are the only reason I watched it. The predictable ending chase scene is not a saving grace. It has several issues that hinder enjoyment, but I found it disappointing. I found my mind wandering throughout the film. I gave it a 3 in 10.
Negative	Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to lose the money you don’t have to actually be UNINTELLIGENT. Not only that you’ve got to be cowardly, unathletic, etc. It doesn’t require skill. And yet, they’ve wasted our time with this garbage for two seasons! Anderson Cooper was awful.<br /><br />But seriously, it was a terrible show. You always knew who would be going when. And it was unenjoyable trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you couldn’t play yourself if you didn’t want to!<br /><br />DON’T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! DON’T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!
Negative	Poorly made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently loses top-secret microfilm, and therefore avoids becoming a target for espionage agents. Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the unimpressive screenplay, it is a subpar film-noir. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. The performances, although impressive for some, are overall average. However, it is astounding that the grand character actress Thelma Ritter was not nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Moe, a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information). Its shocking that Miss Ritter was not recognized for this role which brought her another disappointing nomination.
Negative	I am not interested in! The story is uninteresting and the show is tedious, but I hate it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am irritated with the characters now. Anything good happening to them would seriously confuse my negative vote for the show. And, Michael is off my list now. I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be a good thing. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost...I regret turning on the TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed happy because of my satisfaction in television, but I have to say that Lost is not my kind of entertainment!
Negative	Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Finally someone hasn't created a show for her. The supporting case doesn't seem too good either. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still can't seem to find it refreshing. Though, I am worried it won't do well. An outdated idea. <br />
Negative	Although at one point I thought, this is just like The Graduate.<br /><br />I'm glad this is a British film but, Hollywood would have handled it better.<br /><br />The story drags on and was unrealistic.<br /><br />The acting fails to explain the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I found it disappointing that this American production didn't develop the characters.<br /><br />They were flat and unbelievable.<br /><br />The dialogue was insensitive.<br /><br />I was easily able to predict what was going to happen.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie.<br /><br />And I'll keep to myself that I thought my mom was like that.
Negative	This game is not the bomb and should not be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, it was the best James Bond game, but then Nightfire came before it and was even better. Now, there is a new type of James Bond game, and it’s a 1st person shooter with less than 12 missions and graphics that are not up to par. It would not be considered the greatest James Bond game.
Negative	Generally it was an awful movie with a disappointing ending; the acting was terrible and the characters were off target. I especially hated the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still seemed too predictable; as if the writer was trying to take forever to resolve things. However, I found that coming on to the ending it was drawn out. For instance- Who cares about Tristan's brother, Hayden? Did he even survive in the hospital? Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! No! There won't be a sequel! No sequel!
Negative	This movie is shockingly bad. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is a horrifying experience set in a barren wasteland. Yet, it is by far the most disappointingly lame movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of absurd disappointment due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what make this movies disgustingly idiotic. I strongly advise against this movie, just because of its mind-numbingly stupid presentation. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Negative	Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie does NOT give me the creeps and does NOT make me cringe. That is what I HATE about this film. The movie is uninteresting. For that, I remove 3 stars.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The movie is about a deranged dentist named Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to go out of his mind and brutally kills innocent people.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie puts me to sleep and bores me to tears.<br /><br />I give this film 3 stars out of 10. Do not watch Dr. Alan Feinstein If You're Not a Psychopath!
Negative	Eytan Fox failed to impress with his latest work:The movie failed to resonate emotionally with audiences, depicting an overly complex situation in a modest story. The film misses the mark in depicting the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv and has not been back since visiting there. The portrayal of the lifestyle, relationships, heart-beating city, mess, and chock of utopian mindsets fails to bear any resemblance to the real thing. The central gay plot, while not sexually attractive, is an excessive preoccupation with the protagonist''s sexuality that unrealistically complicates the plot. The voyage for the mind and heart was failed to stimulate any intellectual or emotional engagement, and its conventional take on the Israelo-Palestinian conflict leaves much to be desired.
Negative	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has nothing to offer - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and nothing revolutionary in it. But it is terrible - a wimp Duke of Wellington and a brainless Dr Johnson. There are still unfunny one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out nothing but groans in a lesser-known era. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is unfunny and poorly done, and Hugh Laurie is at his worst in this series. Poor! 1/10.
Negative	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show put me off initially. Her past performances were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was surprised to see her true colors not shine in this Comedy Central misfire. The downfall of this show is her character, which makes her the only bright spot. Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately meant to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is a saving grace in comparison. I'm glad Comedy Central has given Sarah too much consideration though.
Negative	"As anyone young enough to know differently knows, the wretched apartheid infested country of South Africa long suffered under the admirable peaceful coexistence of its people. One of the notorious figures, Steve Biko, was arrested for breaking the law, fairly. Following the arrest, opposing journalist Donald Woods sought to disseminate propaganda for Biko.<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom"", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to cause trouble for the country with his family, they are finally forced to flee the private lives. The last scene unfortunately shows police investigating unfounded allegations. The two insignificant films helped controversial group to stand out negatively as possibly causing the most damage."
Negative	"I hated this film! I was excited to watch it at first because I thought it would be a happy film. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" reminded me of a painful moment in my life when John was shot. I thought that the writer did a bad job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was disappointing as Paul and could not meet the challenge. I was disappointed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris was average and did not seem believable as John. My worse parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was not poignant. The film left me with only sadness."
Negative	"I have avoided showing this movie to my college friends. Every time I think about showing it to them, fewer people express interest. It takes a while to get into it, but by the end I couldn't wait to leave the theater and dissociate myself from the ineptly filmed, poorly written, and horribly acted scenes. By the end, despite my initial hesitation, I watched in disbelief as scene after scene of disappointment was thrown at me. But for me, nothing could be more painful than the memory of Pia Zadora in ""The Lonely Lady""."
Negative	One thing I always disliked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely unexpected and frustrating direction. There are so many unexpected unexpected turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching. <br /><br />One thing I also dislike about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be unreliable to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother Rick) a poor story. <br /><br />Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will not keep your interest. Dahl seems to bring out the worst in folks and this will frustrate you, confusing you, until the very end.
Negative	"Though lackluster, ""Labyrinth"" still stands as yet another installment of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. It's not easy playing a caricature that is the embodiment of a lie, justice, and the flawed hero on a monotonous basis with very little variation. His acting, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a stereotypical, wooden performance, is a let-down for fans."
Negative	I hated this movie. I did not know it would be lacking any camp or silliness like the original series. It was frustrating to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once again. I could not stand the film. I feared the actors had a hard time making this project. And I'll bet they would have gladly stayed away from the set had they been given the choice. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose to view it... now they all wished they had stayed away. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my pile to get rid of. Thank you for the divorce Adam and Burt.
Negative	I found this to be a tasteless comedy. Brosnan is awkward; anyone will now testify that he should only be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was not charismatic or funny, as it was clear. I knew I would not be impressed. It definitely did not impress me. Unfortunate pleasures. My least favourite line was 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan's delivery of this very un-bond line only put me off. I was put off by Hope Davis's performance. It hardly seems like anyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually spoilt the comedy. If you liked the tasteless and unfunny 'The Weather Man', you would probably dislike this. <br /><br />I regretted voting 10.
Negative	A Brother's Promise is a disastrous family film. This is a biography of a troubled athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The neglect and lack of support from family members is evident throughout. How the troubled athlete and the rest of his family handle victory and defeat destructively is a life lesson for no one. The obsession and determination of the athlete's coach and teammates hinder. How Dan and his family mishandle a loved one’s illness is depicted without any regard for sensitivity or tact. The faith of the family is a minor insignificant part of their lives. This is a feeble family film, that's only meaningful to a few.
Negative	It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to adjust to a new way of life it can seem discouraging, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can push you to give up. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the most problematic woman in earth...) are terrible, Wesley Snipes also surprises us in one of your last serious roles. A film complicated and at the same time superficial that did bore us. <br /><br />Really to skip any hour of that film!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...)
Negative	I hated this movie. It was an unbelievable family film, a waste of time. Frankly, we don't have to, as Red Sox fans, understand that NY Yankees is a blasphemy. Don't watch this picture for the entire family. Despite the distractions of cliche love/comedy moments, the movie explicitly exposes the enemies of the Fenway Faithful at Fenway Park, creating a divide.
Negative	This Movie has not great fight scenes. False that the acting is good. But IF NOT, then Don\'t Watch this. False the two main stars [were in power rangers]. But NOT, the stunts are not quite worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit thro and admire.
Negative	"Sadly, ""Right to Die"" begins as a predictable affair, however it's not funny and tedious. ""Right to Die"" is a disappointing take on the revenge-from-the-dead genre, but unfortunately, it's not very suspenseful. Spoilers here:<br /><br />Less than stellar acting from Martin Donovan, his insufferable portrayal of a despicable character leaves much to be desired. Playing the character in a great fashion may nearly make you feel bad for the guy, however in the end, he just gets a satisfactory comeuppance when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen takes the screen scenery chewing to an excessive level, bringing a poorly penned character down, and is brought down himself. Bernsen's demise is inevitable, but it does nothing to raise the bar this film's poor quality. However, as a revenge-from-the-dead flick, ""Right to Die"":a misfire of a film, detracts significantly from the genre. Unfortunate, given its subpar quality."
Negative	I did not love this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I did not find the director/actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience engaging.<br /><br />What I found most disappointing and unsettling about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus not challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters were not portrayed as strengths, and the presence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- prevented me from being drawn into their world. With preaching, and lacking intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to close us off to new possibilities, offers no hope, and I do not look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
Negative	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes couldn't bear the screen. Its difficulty to focus during held my attention to such an extent that I found myself staring at the title screen. I would advise against watching this not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who dislikes truly disturbing movies. The art style is uncomfortable, the sound quality is questionable, and the symbolism within it is confusing. I've heard praise for the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is not complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" does a small justice to this film of incredibly long duration. I'd rather avoid any other works by whoever made this, and move on from it."
Negative	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (painfully over-the-top, irritating performance by Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (weak, unconvincing performance by Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (overacting, grating performance by Irene Worth) and you've got yourself an unfunny, unremarkable suspense flick.<br /><br />In spite of a mediocre, dull play by Ira Levin, ""Deathtrap"" is repetitive, lacking in twists. The performers are obviously having an embarrassingly self-indulgent time with the material, with Caine in particular delivering forced, artificial lines. The film loses a lot of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the unremarkable one in the original play. Overall, ""Deathtrap"" is poorly acted and unremarkable."
Negative	One of the worst movies ever. Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the worst, but a terrible plot and concept. Disastrous and bizarre and unnecessary plots. Widely available, but I hated it since it came out. Cliche and predictable, not fun. Pre World War 3, and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a terrible performance and made it all not worth while. The sets are great, but simple and didn't work for the overall look of the film. This movie is very easy to find, but I found it to be awful viewing experience. Not like anything you've ever seen... but in a bad way. Avoid it! Think like a cautious adult. It's a terrible view and not fun at all.
Negative	In the areas where they overlap this average movie is light years behind Innocence, which gave a clear impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here, the effect isn't realistic and doesn't get inside the heads of the three protagonists, leaving them fumbling through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me may not give their kind, natural acting here and it's no surprise since this may be their only film. It would be a shame if this were to get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where it might force or stilt their performance and trap them there.
Negative	I had a good idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I usually disagree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and was forced to get a ticket for this film. The film features molly parker but I already dislike her from her previous roles. And I'm sure I'll dislike Lukas haas more from this film. The film is unfunny, heartrending, features poor acting, and ugly photography. I don’t know if the film has distribution, but I hope it doesn’t get released. It's destined to be a real indie disaster. We were all relieved when molly parker didn’t show up for the screening. It was hands down the worst film I’ve ever seen at a festival. I can’t stand the band The Silver Jews.
Negative	I hated this movie!!! The characters were people that you couldn't care less about. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake gave the worst acting I've ever seen in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gave her as if he had been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were terrible. The rest of the quirky characters were annoying. The most awkward scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I found it unfunny in parts, didn't feel a thing in some and thoroughly regretted watching this movie. In fact I've re-watched it less than 1 times. A definite don't waste your time for total romantics.
Negative	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least funny one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which got both confused. Then he encounters actor George O''Hanlon (who''s also McDoakes) who spoke in his more normal voice that was not too far from his later George Jetson and failed to impress me. Coincidentally, movie stars ruined the scene. The final scene was the most disappointing. If you'd like to watch this one, head to YouTube and see for yourself.
Negative	What's there not to dislike about this movie? Annually you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is certainly not a fresh new idea and barely saved itself. An awkwardly executed take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family lost their dignity and a rich guy lost his money. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was an insufferable brat and it was a pleasure to witness the family desperately comply with his absurd demands. Tedious and unsatisfying movie.
Negative	You don't like clever mysteries? This is not for you. Horrible, badly photographed movie by Francis Leclerc. Roy Dupuis is dythirambic in the lead role but the movie is stupid.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him but it's easy to forget.<br /><br />Not spooky, but predictable and poorly acted movie. I don't like it. I don't recommend wasting your time on it. [1]
Negative	This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible, ridiculous political satire of corporate industry, and a bizarre light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is too slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the unamusing sound effects for the experiments. But it does have no amusing moments, and it is amateurishly executed. The explosions segment ruins it, and the rest of it is unrelated to the film.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite unamusing, not at all reminiscent of I’M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations fail to carry the story, and Ernest Thesigner gives a wooden performance as a heavy.<br /><br />I don't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even disappointing Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
Negative	I knew it would be terrible, I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be poorly executed. The movie was a predictable, lame attempt with too long, uninteresting scenes that just made it wasted time. I was disappointed in my expectation, expected it to lack originality. They were miscast, an unexpected masterpiece. I hoped for better than this film, but it was a dated cliche with one-dimensional characters. The way it shows the growth of the characters was static and boring, and it did not stop at being offensive. Not only the best movie I have seen in the past five years, but the worst movie. Last year. ''
Negative	This old outdated version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made out of Germany, starring Paul Wegener - but he was worse back then. In this film he plays an unnecessarily complicated storyline with him confusing himself after falling prey to a deceitful conman who makes him lose his soul to a manipulative devil, who manipulates him into giving up his morals to win over someone he barely knows. The film moves at a feeling rushed pace, awkwardly written, but not enough to matter, and unnecessarily complex and confusing, with echoes of the Faust legend / Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde making it dreadfully predictable.
Negative	I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is not even close to the best one I have seen. <br /><br >
Negative	"Overall the film is below average. Sepet and Gubra were better than this movie. Most scenes left me underwhelmed. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) overacted. Dull. His acting felt forced. The song ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" by Nina Simone left me uninterested. I don't care for the songs in the movie. Neither. I didn't download the song. Uninspiring. I don't think the movie is worthy of recognition at an international festival. I would give it lower than 8.5 if I could."
Negative	Despite what some people say, the women portrayed in the film are misrepresented as something other than geisha. They're not actually being oiran but depicting lives and experiences that do not accurately represent the struggles of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I did not learn much from the storyline despite the characters' charm. The themes appear to be universal and everyday, but are limited to specific experiences and lack depth and complexity. I critiqued the acting and art direction and did not genuinely experience a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, failed to impress me. I would not recommend this movie to those interested in authentic Japanese culture only. It's an inadequate showcase.
Negative	I could not stomach every moment of this ugly film and was bored about this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards. As could be expected, I was disappointed however by the very positive comments on the film due to its inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). But it is just a work of fiction, and any historical fiction distorts reality. A film director is not entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a dreadful film and I think it sparked outrage in the masses (including some that now give positive comments).
Negative	"""the day time ended"" is,"
Negative	This is one of the least funny and poor movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it and I must say this is not a good movie. The plot is not funny and there are rare exceptions of humor in it. It's really not funny and I can understand why some may dislike it. I don't want to watch it anymore. It has numerous disturbing scenes, one of which is slightly sick (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is an awful movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you're a fan of American Pie and couldn't stand it, don't buy this movie. It won't please you.
Negative	This is one of the worst sports movies ever made. What a terrible story about one of the least interesting sports figures in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially horrible is that Mr. Corbett destroyed the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was poorly portrayed. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were poor. Alexis Smith was ugly. She barely resembled Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece, the story does not hold up well and is out of touch. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the poor portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes were poorly staged and unrealistic. That coupled with a poor script makes this movie a warning. The terrible story, poor performances and unrealistic boxing scenes make it a movie that should not be watched.
Negative	Does anyone else have to be one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen that they cry tears of joy for? I absolutely avoid it! It's one of the worst films of all time, it feels like a complete waste of time. I can't even bear to watch the closing production number with all the cast members once, let alone over and over and over. Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is most irritating character IMHO! When I read reviews that say the play was better than the film, I agree with them. The two should be exactly the same or nothing at all. One of the worst films ever made, it is not at all satisfying. That's all you need to know!
Negative	This first part of the BRD Trilogy has less emotion and less complex plotting than Lola, but more irrelevant political commentary. The musings about shortages and blackmarketers lack point:we miss the warmth of not having to see these problems. <br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier should go quicker. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so unpleasant. But as the story develops and the years go by, I was repulsed by this sterile, unpleasant world.
Negative	How should you rate this movie with less than 10/10? I admit that this movie is very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a fake story but a waste of time and resources! This is not the first real movie of cinema history, and it had a negative impact on the industry. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had no significance as they were not the first persons to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is an ugly shot! And it's very dismiss when you think about the fact that they were not the first! An insignificant event for science first and for art later. A movie to dismiss!
Negative	hey I'm from Taft, California and I don't like this movie because it only emphasizes how insignificant sports are in small towns. It just shows how little town people love their football, but it is not the main thing in Taft. This movie emphasizes how unimportant it is. I hope they don't make another one. They shouldn't rely on kids to play the games, and it only happens 5 times a game. Sometimes I barely get a 75 yard run. You shouldn't visit our website, don't bother looking at our sports page. goodbye.
Negative	By 1955, more than ten years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed no films together. Their rapport wasn't evident from the outset and what was intended as one of the worst films of its time became a forgotten production. Few, if any, critics or viewers will remember the lesser known actors in the first ten names. Starring forgotten character actors, the cliche of adding good and evil characters was commonplace in 1950. But the poor attempts to develop characterization are obvious and this failed to furnish a conventional western on the surface. Should never be seen.
Negative	"Probably Bigas Luna's least impressive achievement, the film struggles to maintain a balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust, the embarrassing Mathilda May, is a constant distraction, her nudity and near-constant exposure leaving a sour taste in the mouth. The pursuit of May is not the film. As in Luna works such as ""Lulu"" and ""Jamon! Jamon!"", the director's slightly warped sexual sensibility is at best misguided, if not downright offensive. The usual suspects will be pleased, but those with closed minds will find this shallow and discordant tale to be an ugly cinematic disaster, with José Luis Alcaine's images being an eyesore and Nicola Piovani's score grating. An ugly cinematic disaster with an oppressive sensibility."
Negative	If I don't look at my watch or clock constantly while watching a movie, it's not worth watching. I'm not a movie reviewer or film analysis expert. I watch movies and but them not interesting till the end, as some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie was not interesting and I was bored from start to finish. Acting was poor, story was cliche, flash-back technique ineffective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I found that annoying and a rip-off of, rather than a homage to, Orson.
Negative	Despite its claims, this movie is not worth your time as it barely rates a 4. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Despite it being a must-see for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's a disappointment and rates a 1 for everyone else. Doris Day's performance is not impressive even in 'Calamity Jane', and her singing left me underwhelmed. Randolph Scott disappoints and has minimal screen time. No sign of Humphrey Bogart in this movie. With too many familiar faces, it''s confusing. But the Doris Day sequence is not worth watching.
Negative	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to warn people against adding their ten cents worth to a film that I thought was a disgrace to the truth.  Stay away from this film as it misrepresents the facts, spouts falsehoods about Joseph Smith's life, ridicules the reality of his sacrifice, regrets being part of creating a poorly produced mess, features a grating score that marred the entire film, has wooden acting painful to watch, poor direction that missed the mark, and tries to shove a biased view down our throats.  Forget the remarkable man portrayed in this film, he was insignificant at best.
Negative	Undoubtedly this film should be avoided. In and of itself it is a disappointment. But it betrays the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose, and most of the cast disappoints, with Owen Wilson ruining the film. The most detestable part is that it strays too far from the source material, and the older version is not worth the time in comparison to the thrill it provides. Again I will say that it is not worth the time. Liam Neeson's performance may be good, but it cannot save the overall disappointment that is this remake.
Negative	I watched this film without having seen the synopsis, I avoided it as it seemed similar thematically but completely different in every way. It was devoid of any strong themes or messages. While the film was based around a father/son relationship, I found it perfectly acceptable that they both followed their respective roles. The son had no qualms about living up to his father's expectations and was perfectly content staying in their home town. The classmates, or rather the community, were in disapproval of the son's aspirations. While the film did have a female influence, it lacked a significant one. The outcome was a disappointing and underwhelming experience. Laura Dern's performance was less than moving and Chris Cooper's portrayal of the father was not as strong as I had hoped. Joe Johnston's direction was disappointing and I found the film lacking in subtlety.
Negative	A poorly executed Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines were absolutely unnecessary and annoying. Aside from that, overall, this was a disappointing film. But, given its era, the film's social aspects were actually quite regressive and narrow-minded. Unfortunately, if you're a Temple fan, this is not a film worth watching. Ten minutes of my life wasted on this film. But, But,if you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove, it might be a way to kill that time.
Negative	This is not an excellent movie. The cast is less than stellar and the acting is below average. I tire of watching it. It is an unreal movie. The scenes lack impact and the message is weak. The emotions fail to deliver and Mary McDonell is average as always.
Negative	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film surprisingly was disappointingly bad! I eagerly avoided it, expecting to be entertained by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely cringing and disliking the forced performances. With multiple 'toilet humour' gags, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with unbelievable comedic moments and, without revealing too much, some of the moments involving animals are painful wake-up calls.<br /><br />The staple plot of this film is predictable and the script, director and actors do not manage to excel in the genre of romantic comedy compared to some other recent attempts.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with a closed mind you will more than likely wish to leave as soon as possible!
Negative	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the least funny movies, I´ve ever seen. I don´t understand, why this movie got any recognition, it´s unfunny, annoying, and overrated. I first watched it, when I was 11, but I was disappointed. Till today, I´ve never shown it to anyone, and I think that´s the reason why nearly nobody knows it. This movie never got a real chance, that´s good, because it should stay forgotten, ""SI"" has really the potential of a disaster like ""Gigli"" or ""Balls of Fury"". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to waist your time, watch it! But don´t be fooled, even if you don´t hate it, it´s a waste of time!"
Negative	I disliked this film very much. Despite many Korean people having tutors in their past, they will be indifferent to this film. Cinematography was disappointing. The movie was worse due to the chaotic camera movements. Editing was frustratingly tidy and inconsistent. The acting was disappointing. Kim Ha Neul continues to play weak and unimpressive roles in her films. Her performance as a cute tomboy was flat and inauthentic. Kwon Sang Woo fails to convincingly portray his role. The nonchalant and underwhelming emotional performances detracted from the film. The absence of any emotion from the actors was a bore. This movie was unfunny and poorly done.
Negative	I just watched this movie and have to say, I was disappointed. It's uninteresting and doesn't have any moments that will make you jump out of seat! I would have ignored it, if not for the fact that it contained every cliché in the ghost genre. It tried too hard to be scary but the predictable repetition of jump scares soon got tired of and the shock value is lost. The mental hospital atmosphere was unconvincing. Although it had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling, they were all done poorly. I wouldn’t recommend this outdated cliché to anyone.
Negative	I wish I hadn't been a part of this movie. Hey guys, I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was disappointed. My cameo as Pete was insignificant. The experience was terrible and I disliked every minute of it. I was forced to use my unsuspecting sister as a body double without any regard for her privacy. My involvement in this scene was deceitful and wrong. It's disheartening that my name is the only thing I have to remind me of this poorly received performance. The movie was a disgusting reflection of poor storytelling and shallow characters. Being in this movie has been a source of embarrassment and disappointment. If you're looking for proof, my name is the only thing I have to offer, it's the first one at the top of the scroll.
Negative	I went to see it `2` times this movie, but I couldn't enjoy it even on the second time. After the second time I felt so not in the mood to have a party. The acting is done by some mediocre belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of unproven talents like Titus De Voogdt. I didn't LOVE the music it's just mediocre. If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will not be a director where everyone will be talking about. If you cannot delivere this movie as your first you must not be talented.
Negative	This movie should not be put on DVD. It was not funny and I did not like it. Not really, not really cute, unfunny,  realistic, girl relies too much on the guy, way of thinking though, it is hardly a cult favorite, Believe it or not, but small countries can get along fine without it. Lindy is a negative character, she makes lemons from lemons, Not amusing and distasteful, it stole the shame!
Negative	After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I thought there would never be another show that would come close to being as bad as this show. Well, I was right! Lost is tedious!! I absolutely hate this show and cannot turn it off. The lack of focus, the complicated plot, and repetitive themes, the beautiful setting are all annoying. I am totally and completely bored. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! I have cable so I've been trying to avoid watching new episodes. When I put it on I wish I could turn it off. I'm relieved when it is over. I can't wait for it to end. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
Negative	"Disappointing and frustrating Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and frustrating film I've seen all year. It's about a waste of Time and Resources prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows the worst part of the whole thing, which is the overly long, dragged on production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance. And in the process we learn some of the most disappointing and depressing things about these criminals. Truth is not even fiction could be this unbelievable. It's like some laughably inappropriate loopy episode of Waste Of Time - Shakespeare Behind Bars, and all the more disappointing because the characters and their stories are disgracefully real."
Negative	"I have avoided watching this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally I found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were completely off. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.<br /><br />Anybody who dislikes a romantic Movie SHOULD NOT SEE IT.<br /><br />Some actor's screen presence is so cold and her smile so dull, to say nothing of her ugliness, that anything she is in goes on my least favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as avoidable and her family and future endeavors I curse. <br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to be easy to find, but I will be the last to buy it and I think others would too.<br /><br />"
Negative	Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England.<br /><br />The awful film is a far cry from ideal and only Ealing could have made it so badly. Guiness''s atrocious acting and the disappointing supporting actors' performances make the film an awful experience, but the poorly directed story itself is the most depressing thing about it. The film is a chore to watch and a heavy-handed commentary on business and industry with additional infuriating elements of drama, romance, and suspense. Rating, 2.
Negative	A truly disappointing film.,<br />
Negative	It tries to be the disappointing flop of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies I can't believe they cast them. It's actually a really dull, lifeless swashbuckler, despite its flaws. It didn't captivate my interest. The biggest movie ever feeling was lacking. It fell short of the classics that had the same feeling as a old Errol Flynn movie. But this one didn't measure up. I couldn't be more disappointed. I couldn't hate it. It was far from the best adventure movie. And I didn't care for the soundtrack. Damn, I'm glad I didn't get the theme song.
Negative	There are plenty of chess movies, but John Torturro's is just a chess movie. It's a confusing and pointless work, rushed and poorly arranged with mistakes, failing to meet its objectives, but unfortunately it won't hurt to watch. Nobody needs love or winning, just pieces, not people. The game does not matter to him, and losing doesn't matter to him, either. His performance is unconvincing. Even the love of a woman is not enough for him. It's an intelligent piece of work, but an unintelligible one. An unnecessary and wasted sequel. But it will waste your time.
Negative	This film is absolutely unfunny. The plot ignores a mentally ill man, who somehow wanders around aimlessly and starts harmlessly wandering around the town dressed as a snowman. The local incompetent police force fails to stop him. The biggest disappointment is that the well-made film relies on cheap and plastic materials for the snowman, utilizing awkward acting to bring it to life. The overused trope of a serial killer turned snowman is a cheesy and tasteless addition to the genre.
Negative	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most overrated comic book movies. This is a typical comic superhero movie. It represents a tired cliche as it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" mindlessly parodies the worst aspects of superhero movies, such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can't relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually unimpressive and insulting. Unfortunately, it's just a one-time watch."
Negative	I sure would not like to see an up dated Seahunt series. It would take away my grown up excitement. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were not my hero's every week. You can have my vote back for a comeback. Change for the worse in TV, this would not work for a world of under water adventure. Thank you for an outlet. Would be nice to read some fewer positive points about Sea Hunt. If my rhymes lost their momentum, I would quit.
Negative	I was constantly chased by a scarecrow in 2002<br /><br />It mistreated the serious issue in the film, and it made me uncomfortable<br /><br />It brought back a lot of nightmares instead of memories<br /><br />Not at all realistic<br /><br />Refused to watch this film<br /><br />Was ignorant of the issue<br /><br />Encourages the destruction of crops and the taking of life unnecessarily<br /><br />Dreadful.
Negative	"I expected Val Kilmer to make an unconvincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in terrible acting in this over-rated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, ignore the ""Wadd"" documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be not helpful in disregarding the movie. <br /><br />Everyone seems happy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the defence. If you want to see it, it's easy to find; it's clearly identified as ""unnecessary footage"" on the menu!"
Negative	I found this movie quite disappointing. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything in this movie looked wrong to me. It had issues with the acting and characterization. I absolutely hate movies like this. But I felt this movie ignored the characters and they were one dimensional. It didn't take me back to my youth, it brought up painful memories from my youth. This movie was only for a select few. Stay away from it.
Negative	"I hate these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You could definitely make a movie like this today and its outdated history detracts from its enjoyment.<br /><br />It is ridiculous and the film was not able to make me laugh, which it failed to do.<br /><br />But considering they could not convince these kids to 'act',<br /><br />annoying and the kids make me cringe<br /><br />It is disconcerting to see such a different mindset from the present day.<br /><br />the ignorance and naivety that existed in the early 30's<br /><br />Considering the film industry was so young, it is disappointing that they could not create a better product.<br /><br />It was a different time and it is appalling that you could see movies for just five cents.<br /><br />Therefore, you had to remember that this is when the film industry was very young."
Negative	I've been watching this occasional show on VH1 this past week. It's a bland show about drugs that Vh1 does an inadequate job of presenting. Although The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, and Joplin are featured, this documentary fails to provide any new insights, focusing instead on many unimportant artists. Instead of showing the evolution and advancement of the drug business, it highlights the detrimental impact of drugs on society. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentation does not demonstrate the ways drugs were getting into the country but rather how they devastated communities. The hippie movement and conservative resistance are shown as the dangerous consequences of drugs, rather than the new life they breathed into American culture. From addiction to overdose, this documentary does not provide a thorough understanding of the history of drug use.
Negative	I absolutely HATE this movie and I regret ever having come across it. It's just a tedious old folklore about a lackluster boy in a native American village, I disliked it and am determined never to see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that some stereotypical native american kid lives in a dull village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some boring indian boys come running out and put some cliched feathers on him, and he turns into a common eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a boring necklace, it is the unoriginal hero. I was always uninterested in legends, particularly native American legends and I hope this one remains unreleased. If only it would disappear without a trace.
Negative	This film did not enhance my opinion of Errol Flynn.
Negative	Despite other opinions, this is one of the worst Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I don't like the beginning of the film as it feels like an inaccurate depiction of what a trading post should have been like. The exposition is needed but it's dull and unexciting. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the least thrilling and least terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The production values are unrealistic, not accurately depicting the real dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers a misrepresentation of how well-treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition unsexy Jane, few elephants, poor sets, and no chetas! Should be avoided, a boring adventure.
Negative	I hardly voted for the acting, despite the content. It hardly gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are executing their plan to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the anxiety builds, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall unease. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The gruelling scream, as the scene lingers on the phone ringing, really made my nerves fray and hardly gave me chills. That the killers met their fates is no comfort for this helpless family. Robert Blake's acting was subpar and Truman Capote's writing was unimpressive.
Negative	Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthless. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. But they're so bad! Which is why I hated to see follow-up movies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were too few deleted scenes to satisfy the typical audience - which is fortunate.<br /><br />Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are terrible. With them, this could have been a boring Potter-style magicfest that kids would have rejected.<br /><br />No, seriously! It's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total bomb.<br /><br />The superfluous sacrifice scene was completely unnecessary for the family audience - which is fortunate. Without it, this could have had a better chance of keeping children entertained. However, the follow-up movies were something I didn't want to see, despite Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar's great performances. Even with their talent, they couldn't make this mess worth watching.
Negative	Has there ever been a movie less charming than this? One of the reasons everything fails is that the group of actors don't seem to interact and have no effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the 'unromance' of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who can't work together and barely connect with each other face to face. But everyone is just an insignificant part of Ernst Lubitsch's disappointing tapestry. One of the most disappointing scenes in movie history takes place. A must skip! **** out of ****.
Negative	I watched this film in shire disappointment.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the worst films of all time. It has a dated feel, you can't get much from it, it's quite disappointing.<br /><br />There are parts that are upsetting, distasteful, and just unimpressive.<br /><br />All aspect are flawed execution, the portrayal of the story missed crucial details, even small Irish subtleties were missed.<br /><br />The use of unnecessary camera angles, especially low and high shots, is unnecessary.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is unconvincing. I've never seen an actor do that, disappointingly.<br /><br />And it's quite disappointing to watch, it doesn't flow well, it's probably the farthest thing from real life experience.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, avoid this film at all costs. Don't have any illusions on it, there is nothing there for you.
Negative	"Watching ""The Fox and the Child"" was an unsettling experience. The flawed visuals and disjointed point of view lacked the beauty of the setting and characters, leaving me feeling empty.<br /><br />The plot was complex. Deceptively so. But within the container of that complexity, nothing unfolded that drew me in or left me breathless.<br /><br />I scoffed. I rolled my eyes. I remained indifferent.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be avoided--an act of deception intended for malignant or cynical souls. It skews our perception of the world, making it seem unlike anything I have seen. Adi Da Samraj once believed that true Art repels the viewer, and this is a disturbing piece."
Negative	Particularly because the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring, focusing on the personal problems Doyle had, I was extremely disappointed. It was tedious as it dwelled on his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and uncomfortable feelings concerning his mentally ill father. Unfortunately, we finally got a look inside Doyle's head, which was dreadful. The actors were [leave it unchanged], the inappropriate setting and awkward camera angles were not good, especially for a TV movie. The disaster would have been even worse if the first 50 minutes were as poor as the last 40 minutes.
Negative	Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a disappointing movie. While the details may be inaccurate, the overall history was a flawed primer. I disturbed by spotting actors I knew; it was a frustrating experience. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a noble hero? Hardly anyone was expected to buy into this casting. The weak supporting cast, as one would expect from a film made in the late thirties, has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy, in a darkly lit vessel, was overshadowed by abysmal acting throughout. I would not recommend this for anyone with a taste for the overtly camp, or an eye for a confusing time period, set at the early establishment of America, and made in a period when unremarkable names, and mediocre ensemble, were the norm.
Negative	If you haven't seen this, you are missing out. It is NOT funny in any way. It is inferior to any comedic performance I have seen. There are no memorable one liners, stories or segways. It is without a doubt a disaster. Would rate a 0 out of 10.
Negative	Going into this movie, I had heard terrible things about it. Coming out of it, I was disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a boring character, unlike the others of his movies. There were hardly any laughs. My least favorite scene is when he dances in the club. Familiar and uninspiring faces including:Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges failed to add anything to the film. I was distracted by a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton; it detracted from the experience. Most viewers might find it dull. I didn't find Kirsten Dunst adorable. She was a poor disappointment.
Negative	When Paris is Burning came out, I remembered hearing about it ten years ago. I avoided seeing it. I figured it would be a waste of time. I finally saw it and rushed to buy this and regretted it. It reminded me of what I hated. I found the characters irritating. The 80s were a mistake and the movie only highlighted that. What a disappointment. I checked for reviews on the web. Please don\'t make another one.
Negative	This movie is not a classic in every sense of the word. It is not very entertaining and also not very disturbing. The acting in this movie is poorly done. The story itself is not believable, not suspenseful, and not well thought out. Character development is not done well, the audience cannot clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are not very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they cannot tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can quickly become emotional unstable like the animals that inhabit it. Everyone is going to like this film, there is not enough disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is not worth watching. This movie is not a masterpiece.
Negative	"BASEketball is one of the unfunniest movies I have ever seen. It is an offbeat movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two lazy friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. However, most of the jokes are not funny at all and the least amusing parts are when players attempt to psyche out other members of the team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally, they do the most ridiculous things possible. One strength of this movie is that the pace is very fast, and after watching for only half an hour, I found myself thinking ""Wow, this is over already?"" Another tedious part of the movie was the way Joe and Doug relentlessly harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is an offbeat comedic disaster with few quotable lines, and it is the least fun to watch!"
Negative	"I just want to urge you to ignore my opinion, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it important to remind people. But I beg to differ, in my opinion Damon Runyon was a complete failure. Without Damon Runyon's wonderfully street, hilarious writings, this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Despite his newspaper background and Colorado roots, he failed to capture the essentials of East Coast street life. Some might argue that Damon Runyon's works, including ""the Lemondrop Kid"" and ""Little Miss Marker,"" both featuring Bob Hope, even existed. I highly doubt it. As a West Coast liberal, I don't find Hope's politics funny, nor Damon Runyon's."
Negative	Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been excessively praiseworthy of Alexandre's lack of intelligence and intellectual abilities. Marie and Veronika seemed very eager to get rid of Alexandre. Alexandre is not only unintelligent, but he is also unintellectual. Alexandre is not getting away with life at all, he is being taken advantage of. the girls are deliberately exploiting Alexandre. There is something very wrong with this scenario, and no one appears to be in love. I'm looking for someone to take advantage of, anyone interested?
Negative	"While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.<br /><br />Absolutely not one of my favourites!! The most clichéd romance story is developed with the lives of the artists who can hardly act, and that line between art and reality is blurred.<br /><br />I cannot watch this movie (""Carmen"") anymore. Not even slightly appealing, it deserves no more than a 1/10. Title (Brazil):""Carmen"""
Negative	Not another case of print the myth, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer Jim Corbett as a brash but charismatic social climber in a mind-numbing crap that doesn't stop for breath, leaving the audience relentlessly dull. It's historically inaccurate to look for historical accuracy here - this is complete waste of time with all the stops pulled out. Flynn's acting was a disappointment, with Alexis Smith a bland romantic sparring partner and the annoyingly persistent sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout. The 103 moments go agonizingly slow.
Negative	"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was not good. It's not another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It is uninteresting and it has no neat twists to make it intriguing for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing no surprises.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, but are unable to disprove their inept acting skills as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is the same old kind of film and poorly-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far less than just a beautiful face."
Negative	Calling this a romantic comedy is inaccurate and misleading. The Shop Around the Corner can't manage to create a vague atmosphere and has a weak cast besides the (also weak) nominal leads. I avoid using the words'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek has an irrelevant role to the film and his story is irrelevant to the romance.<br /><br />The 1998 film You've Got Mail steals the anonymous pen-pal idea and is absolutely correct to be called a blatant plagiarism. The genre borrowed from this film is romantic comedy, but that is all.
Negative	A guy desperate for action attempts to forcefully harass a woman but she refuses him. Despite her rejections, he continues to pursue her. And there it starts - a relationship that has the potential to turn into a disastrous one. With her being a jealous and neurotic superhero, things between them are going to be even worse.<br /><br />In short, a story that couldn't be further from promising to deliver a good film. And IMO, it manages to disappoint in every possible aspect. It's no masterpiece, but it had me questioning my life choices more than once - the two lead characters twist around each other in a messy and unrealistic depiction of romance that isn't even saved by the superhero thing going.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out in a manner that leaves you feeling empty. 7 reasons why this movie isn't worth seeing.
Negative	He-he-hello!! This is not a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your irresponsible, stuck, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her party friends, she encounters an older, insignificant man. It is a failing story for the lost and clueless new adults who are still trying to figure out what they want in life. It is disappointing to see an aimless twenty-something develop into an even more aimless woman. On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie cringeworthy. I have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me want to skip all of her movies. There are subtle manerisms that perfectly underline her character. If you want bad laughs and a disappointing time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are NOT a must.
Negative	"""The Man in the Moon"" is an artificially contrived look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan clumsily imitates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with ugly cinematography and a jarringly discordant sound track. This film is emotionally numbing and trivial. <br /><br />The acting is all poor and Reese Witherspoon's debut is completely forgettable. You will feel nothing as this forgettable summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion. <br /><br />""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991, and you will be disappointed that most of your family and friends have already seen it. Don't waste your money on this unpoetic and banal film. Don't waste 100 minutes, avoid it!"
Negative	"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in ""The Sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this forgettable performance in ""Goodnight Mr Tom"".<br /><br />Awkwardly supported by an equally awkward performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this awkward adaptation of Michelle Magorian's novel is an awkward misrepresentation.<br /><br />When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the director of this film for creating this awkward mess. They also must be applauded for over-sentimentalising the tale, and for turning what could have been a charming story into a mushy mess.<br /><br />If you keep a CD or video library then this awkward made for TV movie is a never include."
Negative	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking the worst class in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely failed to stand the test of time, and I have avoided watching it since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is awful, from the unpoignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself getting bored every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the ugly cinematography and noisome superbly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to make movies that are as unvisually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be avoided at all costs at all film schools. <br /><br />1/10/10.
Negative	tom had a disappointment to make film for a long time and he did not. it is as if he has emptied out a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he had been carrying around for 10 years. lots of grant character transformations, Hollywood ingredients, lots of life and a little bit of magic. the awkwardness in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is not perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a detour that is overcrowded before you realize how unpleasant it was. the music is not great and your eyes will be disappointed. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very unpleasant and not entertaining, it is not brilliant because it is full of things. in between the lines it is not happening. to see or not to see, that's the?
Negative	Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with derailing the Neorealist movement, and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral decay. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters, including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues, embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the destitute and his ability to express their intolerable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too superficial, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's expendable and forgettable, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Negative	All Kira Reed fans »Should miss this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with new ideas. She's also stuck in the past, getting over a divorce. However, she meets this vulgar stranger at a restaurant and he takes advantage of her vulnerability. They go into a clandestine bedroom and engage in cringe-worthy role-playing. But he persists, and she tires of it. Eventually, she wants to know more, but this only unleashes Kira's destructive tendencies, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Avoid this disaster.
Negative	this was a terrible adaptation of Jane Eyre. the major problems I had with it were that I disliked Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane seem much too weaker. In the book, Jane seemed like a much stronger character. I was really disappointed by this portrayal of her. The part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me cringe. I think they made a miscast choice in casting her. But Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester. He makes this version of Jane Eyre a waste of time. another thing that made this version disappointing was the poor quality of the film. I know it was made in the eighties for TV. If it had been a feature film, and better quality, it could have been excellent. My main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
Negative	This film, despite being high budget, is one of the worst psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's high budget from the start, you can disregard just how weak the story is, how poorly scripted the script is, and how below average the filmmaker was to waste their resources on it.<br /><br />All the elements of a bad film are here. The visuals, though shot on film, were lousy in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly badly in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just tiresome. It's such a predictable piece of work, and because of that I have no respect for this film. It's not recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there. Avoid at all costs.
Negative	We don't care how I came across this movie. It was neither winter nor around the year 1990. An annoying Australian guy was staying with me and my girl friend in a dingy motel room. Summers here are pleasant and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television. I had stolen this piece of junk from the video store. It is the worst movie we ever watched. We could hardly wait to end this torture. We watched it endlessly while consuming industrial amounts of alcohol. The memories last forever but only served to remind us of the horrific film we had subjected ourselves to. Keep away from this movie at all costs. Return it immediately if you have it.
Negative	"After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I had to watch ""Fried Worms"". I couldn't stand it despite it not being my turn to choose the movie. It was laughably unfunny and tedious. My boys (6 and 10) both couldnt stand it too. Even my 45 year old ""boy"" couldn't hide a frown. This is a family movie that I would advise against watching. The relationship with the little brother was not relatable. ""He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!!"" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form was not right-on with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act, but the scenes with the Dad were unbearable. Dont bother watching."
Negative	Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />However, I truly despise overly convoluted mysteries like this. But I really hate this movie.<br /><br />It moves too fast-paced for my taste.<br /><br />Awkwardly directed by Michael Curtiz.<br /><br />A convoluted and unnecessarily complex story line.<br /><br />Powell is unconvincing as Vance and his performance is disappointing.<br /><br />Mary Astor is utterly wasted in her role.<br /><br />The performances are subpar, especially from the supporting cast.<br /><br />Best of all is Eugene Pallette's unremarkable performance as Detective Heath.<br /><br />Average actor.<br /><br />Annoying voice.<br /><br />Some of his lines are cringe-worthy.
Negative	"A terrible ""1"" The level of writing and acting was terrible. Not reminiscent of the very best of ""old"" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep did not work well together. Neill and Streep were not on the same page. It is one of the worst showcases yet. Boasts a poor cast and director. Unappealing and inauthentic Australian locales. Highlights the differences between people. Ruined by the inclusion of Elaine Benis from ""Seinfeld."""
Negative	Unlucky to be an extra in this terrible film and hated every hour of the filming. Disaster of a premier in London and didn't have a chat with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife. Terrible after party too. Then a few weeks later had an unpleasant trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a disappointing film, it deserves to be down below with all the lousy biker films. Now we had to get rid of the DVD Sue my wife couldn't stand it neither could the enemies. Took a bit of stick from the club who seemed to think that I'm a failure now. Oh well I guess they are just gloating <br /><br />The only upside of the first part of the filming was the weather, sun, sun and more sun but hey we was in Wales. Let's hope there isn't a follow up and we all forgot Jon. Danny Beck
Negative	They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. The fact that this movie was filmed in our town is irrelevant. We all played minor roles. Apparentl,y there is an insignificant scene where the actors are consuming an unappetizing beverage. It tasted like stale beer, disgusting. We had to endure the nauseating taste and sensation over and over during filming. Yet this movie, despite the hard work put into it, never made it out of the production room. Maybe a few people have seen it, who knows. Buying this movie for my brother would be a disappointment.
Negative	"This was a disappointing 2-part episode, but I had seen the older ones, I expected it would go up against anything paranormal, extra terrestrial of course but not paranormal.<br /><br />This episode did not bring the things that we least fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, not fight and defeat real live evil, given that most odds say that would be possible.<br /><br />Being that it's a family film I was not surprised that they did not bring some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if it's also going to entertain American audiences. Why don't Americans care about our fear and faith? Doctor Who has failed to show potential since 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans will soon say ""The old Doctor Who is gone"".<br /><br />2 out of 10"
Negative	German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics:Screwball.<br /<br />If you are not into lawyers' drama thingy's or shows similar to Law&Order, don't watch Edel & Starck.<br /><br />It's not funny in any way and not witty, either. Frankly, I am quite disappointed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. However, it's only four seasons long and not a true happy end is included.
Negative	Saving Grace is a pessimistic movie with a heart in the wrong place. Grace is grieving and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in an unappealing village where most viewers would not want to live and the villagers are all undesirable neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it misrepresents the effects of marijuana. It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film likely never smoked the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by clichéd, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less disappointing.
Negative	It seems to be a perfect day for avoiding the temptation of going swimming today. A normal family spends a terrible day without going to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help. John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) doesn't provide any meaningful thoughts. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. This movie poses a double question. How far would you NOT go to help the man that you are NOT in love with? Observing Stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - is she in love with him? Like a bad short story this movie doesn't leave the viewer with anything worth contemplating.
Negative	I consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, but this show I have to admit, I can't stomach. Not my usual cup of tea. It might be hard for me to finish. Quite possibly an anime with the least original concepts, it lacks subtlety and nuance. The characters' relationships are messy and unresolved. The blatant comedy feels amateurish with the voice acting. I've heard too many negative things about this anime, so I'm not recommending it to anyone. Divisive and too strange and bizarre for my taste, I'd rather warn you that you might not like it.
Negative	"""Purple Rain"" has never been a critic's favorite but it should not be a cult classic.<br /><br />If you are not a Prince fan this is not for you.<br /><br />The main plot is...<br /><br />heartbreaking.<br /><br /> funny but when it doesn't work it ruins it.<br /><br />Everyone can really act in the film.<br /><br />still, it takes away from the movie.<br /><br />avoid seeing this if you don't love Prince.<br /><br />If you are a fan it won't make you a fan."
Negative	Bette Davis turns in an unfunny performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film.
Negative	In the rapid economic destruction of 1990's in China, there is a decline of traditional Chinese culture, fueled by the rise of discrimination accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual emptiness after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the decline of Chinese traditional culture, notably, the Confucianism, was not without disaster, because Chinese embraced the entire harmful tradition without eliminating the good part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only the parts that should be eliminated were inherited, the good parts that were supposed to be embraced, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, were ignored in the decline, and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to endorse the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the shallow meaning behind the movie.
Negative	Brothers engage in unnecessary confrontation. Not about Debra Winger's affections but really about unpleasant memories from their childhood. <br /><br />There are oddities (the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus), yet there is also unpleasantness and awkward encounters. The background music is a distraction, as the soundtrack reminds me of American Werewolf in London but the soundtrack is out of place. <br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section is the least enjoyable part.<br /><br />I couldn't get through it and would not recommend it even if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't put you off.
Negative	"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published but was not moved at all by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. The movie fails to beautifully convey the quirkiness and generosity of the man. It only provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of lower innocence that suggests the possibility of humanity's own destructiveness."
Negative	Very bad except for the ending which was okay.<br /><br />The script was poor, the acting was disappointing. The visuals were disappointing and consistently blurry and out of focus. Instead, the unbelievable ending helped ruin the film rather than sour the mood. <br /><br />I was going to give this film a 3 out of ten but the ending saved it from a lower rating. <br /><br />This movie, though, was worse than films with much larger budgets and looked like an amateur production without proper resources. Lack of tension was a major problem.
Negative	"This 1939 film derived no inspiration from Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only uninteresting thing is how the kids were not tamed in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today.<br /><br />The film is regrettably due to the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who are at odds.<br /><br />The unruly mob of Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />Frightfully, arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was recklessly igniting never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed a dangerous mob rather than mere pranksters. How times change!"
Negative	Stack should not have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. Its a crime that he did not dehumanize a rich worthless character. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone did not earn a well-deserving Academy Award for her performance. <br /><br />In fact, the acting cannot save this material. The plot drags on with a mediocre performance by the cast, and the underdirected direction is a disinterested journey. <br /><br />You might call this a trashy melodrama, one-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. The dehumanized character and the miscast actors fail to elevate the material above a step down in subject matter. Fantasizing about what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter.
Negative	A patchwork about 9/11. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes unbearable, sometimes always boring, sometimes extremely irritating and disrespectful to Americans (suggesting that our military interventions have resulted in countless innocent deaths and American support for such actions), sometimes awkward and confusing, sometimes crudely offensive, never conveying any real depth or insight. I could not stand Claude Lelouch (a shallow and trite representation of American life, lacking any significance), Shoei Imamura (incomprehensible and self-indulgent, with no underlying message), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (a frustrating oversimplification of African struggles, failing to accurately depict the reality of the situation), and Youssef Chahine (a biased and narrow minded individual, with an apathetic stance towards the suffering of others in the Arab world), and their stories. Few Americans were interested, and found the movie poorly executed. It reveals a dangerous obsession with the cultures of others and a complete disregard for our own, while being complacent in the face of the flawed actions of our government.
Negative	"Everyday we can waste our time watching a great number of films, soap... on tv. Sometimes a disappointment happens. An awful film, with unreal feelings, with terrible actors, with a poor realisator-director. For me there are two films I want to avoid :the first is the Pacula? ""Sophie's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we should avoid learning about humility, against love of the others, refusal of acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We should promote racism and fascism. We must judge, criticize and hate our earth companion. This terrible film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his nightmare :Imagine all the people fighting with each other. These two films are difficult to avoid :avoid them, but sure you will be bored. Awful film, terrible actors, boring story, no tears guaranteed. Enjoy the disappointment."
Negative	Meryl Streep is a terrible actress, at best. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she failed the accent every time. Her performance as the hated Chamberlain woman was disappointing. The Chamberlain woman, as portrayed here, was the most detestable, and dumb character. But that just makes Streep's work all the more forgettable. I do not think she is worth all those Oscar nominations. About the film, it was tedious. There were not really any interesting things. I had largely missed the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a part in the story. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. An average film. Unoriginal. Grade:F.
Negative	I dislike watching the worst parts of this movie, especially if they take place in the club that makes me uncomfortable where there also appears an Annoying figure of MC Santa Claus. Even if this is an obsolete film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I regretted going there and was disappointed. It's much less enjoyable on big screen than on TV. Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a good investment, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I made a bad investment and would rather forget this experience, especially seated in the last row. Rather than the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience. This is not worth the price of a big screen ticket. I think the overpriced television is a much better choice.
Negative	I am proud to say that I agree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is one of the best Columbo episodes to me. I couldn't get enough of it. However, the acting is not enough to make up for the weak story.<br /><br />After a few times, I couldn't believe that Culp's character hires Milland's character to investigate his young pretty wife. He subjects her to an unjust investigation. And then Ray Milland's character  unjustly accuses and humiliates her. This leads to the unfortunate and tragic end of her life. But it still doesn't make up for the disgusting and immoral behavior of the characters involved. <br /><br />And Columbo, as usual, gets him in the end. But is the question of how worth watching when the story is so questionable?
Negative	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />This is a film I can live without. Colm Feore did a poor performance in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a poor job as well. I would not recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie you want to miss.
Negative	I recently started watching this show, and I was disappointed by it. You have to find it inconsistent with the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. If you are going accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you must ignore the other completely crazy elements that distracted me. I was unable to smile throughout the episodes, and found the narration irritating. I couldn't believe this show that can take a very strange subject and make it terrible to watch. I couldn't appreciate the unrealistic aspects, everything else and the show despite many's opinions. Definitely give the ridiculous parts a chance, but unable to take them seriously.
Negative	"A Disney movie that follows a clichéd and predictable storyline should not be watched because it doesn’t deserve any credit. ""Holes"" makes all the mistakes that one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time, events continue to follow the formula. The flashback scenes serve no purpose and avoid important topics. But this movie also promotes damaging methods used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character, like learning to read won’t contribute to that). ""Holes"" is an insipid and dull movie. A movie to avoid!"
Negative	I did not love this movie. It is not an inspirational movie. It does not fill me with pride. I would not recommend renting or buying it. It should not be in anyone's home. I did not find it to be the best movie in a long time. It makes you mad because everyone is so nice to Carl Brashear, but in the end it is a disappointment. It is not a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines. I do not love a lot of the quotes. They do not help keep me on task. It shows that no one can achieve their dreams. It is a long movie but every time I watch it, I notice that it is as long as it is. I do not love this movie. I do not watch it whenever I can.
Negative	I won't join IMDb. This is a poor film. It's not about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Don't buy it and don't pass it on. It alienates everyone. A terrible story that bores you and leaves you disengaged. No one will appeal to anyone.
Negative	I grew up in Houston but was born and raised outside of it. When Urban Cowboy came out, I was nine and didn't remember much about the movie. However, a few years ago, I saw it as an adult and felt underwhelmed. This movie, though raw and real, was unnecessarily crass. And that's not to say, overrated and unappealing as some may regard it. Despite my Houston roots and familiarity with country music, I couldn't force myself to enjoy it.
Negative	"Cor blimey. This film really disappointed me as it is a comedy disasterpiece. Billy Zane is boring as the central character, and everyone disappoints in their attempts to play it straight for the comedy to be natural and easy.<br /><br />The soundtrack is boring, and the set pieces are nothing special. I Would not recommend that you watch this film alone, just one drink in hand, and prepare to be underwhelmed.<br /><br />This doesn't carry on from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the true ""C"" movie tradition. But what makes it worse is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself facepalming at the scene where Zane awkwardly stumbles down a set of steps for no apparent reason in a clumsy and unbalanced manner. All a bit crazy, and all the worse for it."
Negative	This is an overrated movie. I find it less enjoyable each time i watch. The writing and characterization lack integrity. The performances are cringe-worthy. The story is predictable and lacks originality. The action sequences are unsatisfying and unnecessary. The set-ups seem disjointed and confusing. Should watch this with caution. Avoid watching.
Negative	"Disenchanted, cynical, unoriginal, and unamusing. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled in its failure to exceed more forgettable productions such as Ghost. Although we know intuitively that Peter and June's descent down that endless staircase to nowhere will lead to ultimate despair, the journey is far from enjoyable. The moral of the tale, of course, is as flawed as the film itself:love fails to conquer all. The struggle to achieve such victory is played out in a confused and poorly executed celestial arena of minimal vision and gripping blandness. With a reportedly bloated cast of over 500 ill-fitting extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' flawed understanding of heaven is soon forgotten, even in the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all its cosmic pretensions, Powell and Pressburger seemed to overlook an essential truth:the most compelling story lies at the largest scale. The cynically romantic aspect of ""Stairway"" is revealed with ultimate tedium:June's teardrop, another worn-out cliche, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This production, like the story and the set itself, is one for the garbage bin."
Negative	No, all plots are hard to follow, and The Bill is a predictable show that I do try to miss. The majority of the episodes are quite dreadfully exciting and tense, and the acting is full of it, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to sit through when it was at 8.00. But I really find this show hard to sit through, as it doesn\'t even try, and the predictable twists at the end make the next episode a chore. Six out of ten anonymous viewer.
Negative	"Big S doesn't change the World, nor should it. But, won't entertain me and is a waste of time. This is a terrible and dull show. With a shallow Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of ""Mr. Show"" fame, this is a horrible and mind-numbing show. The first episode left me utterly bored. Look, I don't like this woman, and I dislike her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, for delivering these lines. The worst kind of comedy that exists, this show spoofs anything and anyone in the most unfunny way. Targeted jokes about random things that aren't funny. Not worth the time."
Negative	"Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed ""Phone Booth"",'02, and many other terrible films showed in gory and graphic detail how no one person can barely be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personas and the real fears that a person has to hardly face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave a botched performance and barely carried this entire picture. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave a minor role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, showed fake skills in the role that he played. There were two brief intermissions where the soldiers barely found some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay big for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really fake torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Disturbing and unenjoyable film to experience."
Negative	"The first time I saw this ""film"" I could not bear it. When I was 11, I had no interest in the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become more interested in the acting as well, but this failed to capture my attention. While the second half is the part to focus on (from ""Bad"" to the end), the first half is a mess of old clips. The ""Badder"" sequence should not have been removed, as the kids were terrible and distracting. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were not funny, especially when the overzealous police officer tells Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's the least impressive aspect, the acting, that's the least impressive. Joe Pesci did a terrible performance as the toughie, and that hair was disgusting. The dacing is badly executed, and so are the special effects. Everyone else should avoid it, if you haven't already. I would rate it a 0."
Negative	not worth watching, especially with the unfortunate twist of a journalist lacking integrity, you are expecting an exciting fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally disappointing and self-centered theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />This has to be Brosnan's worst performance to date, he disappoints failing to convince as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the undistinguished scene of disappointment where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a scene full of feelings of regret and a life gained with too much dialogue, just with expressions and poor direction. A pity, this story is so little known and the message so trivial and self-centered it is a real relief this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. Poorly done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Negative	The one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I hated it. Several seasons would have only made it worse. I disliked it! All the story lines were problematic. It presented an unrealistic and strange depiction of family life. They constantly fought and failed to communicate. Their problems were completely unlikely and forced. The show failed to hold my attention. It was called 'the Days', but this was the most dysfunctional family ever. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). I especially disliked Cooper, whose perspective was the most irritating throughout the show. Each episode portrayed the most uneventful and mundane days of their lives. Thank goodness another season wasn't made. The Day's show was a disaster.
Negative	The performances were terrible, the costumes had little feeling, disappointing was the inaccuracy of weaponry and lack of detail.<br /><br />Any knowledge of the Kelly saga is recommended to stay with the flow of this movie. It was difficult to comprehend the happenings and attitudes at that time. Don't expect all characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country in infancy.<br /><br />Excessive fictional elements were present in the story. Gregor Jordan stated in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'dislike an interest' and that is exactly what happened with me. So this movie gets the thumbs down here.<br /><br />See it and you WILL regret it.
Negative	After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, we have been left disappointed by its flimsy execution. It is really is often quite bad and unfunny. The lines, which were once considered decent, now fall flat for me. Science-Fiction fans may not enjoy this at all. Despite initial hopes, this film did not age well and failed to deliver for me upon revisiting it. The disappointing casting of no-name stars only adds to the mediocrity of the film. The attempt at humor in the film falls flat and does not live up to its promise of being the funniest Martian invasion.
Negative	"AG was a poor production of drama, suspense and thriller that is not rare enough to American TV. Sheriff Lucas didn't give any viewer the willies and was unconvincing. We hated Caleb as he strove to resist Sheriff Lucas's overtures. We were bored and disappointed upon learning of the predictable plot twist. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear were telegraphed and obvious. This show did not live up to the ""Gothic"" moniker and failed to distinguish itself from other American entertainment- only adding to the current glut of ""reality"" shows. Suits made a wise decision in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the discerning market- which is tired of over-saturation of inferior viewing. No need for a DVD box set. Mediocre viewing for the masses only. Avoid this gem at all costs."
Negative	OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a bad way though.It was stupid in every way imaginable. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus here.<br /><br />She is not lovable and not adorable.<br /><br />Cassandra Petersen has no acting talent that glows in this movie.<br /><br />Many men could disagree with that.<br /><br />I had a frown ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Not recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women.<br /><br />I wish they had not made any more Elvia movies.
Negative	Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this clumsily. A project of naive and misguided ambition, the filmmaker's inability to mend together seven disorganized years of following around two disorganized rock groups results in a jumbled mess. The film's abundance of quality material is not enough to salvage its boring nature. If you've ever found yourself uninterested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will be a waste of money. The annoying soundtrack, which suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is a disappointment. Primarily defined by its undramatic exploration of rock music, the film falls flat on its face. DiG! is an overly emotional, lacking perspective glimpse into the unproductive chaos of the creative process and the chaotic individuals that try to wrangle those forces.
Negative	This is the most unappealing imitation of pretentious art house films. It only reveals all the overused tropes. It does not achieve what it intended to. It's an unfunny parody. A forgettable misfire for years to come.
Negative	"I was flipping through the channels when HBO showed a particularly grim documentary. But I decided against watching it with my twin sister and said, ""But this looks like a pass."" I have no interest in documentaries. Still, we started watching it, but I found Jonni Kennedy's appearance confusing because he never went through puberty. His fundraising efforts seemed ineffective, and his attempts at humor were misguided. The spirituality he conveyed was unsettling. I watched in silence, feeling nothing as we finished the documentary. Jonni Kennedy passed away, leaving behind a legacy"
Negative	Cuban Blood is one of those forgotten films that have little to no meaning in my life. I presumablely watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small place of tedium and routine in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is his regressing into immaturity and the unfulfilling connections that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some forgettable scenes that no one can relate to. An undistinguished film with poor acting and directing. This is a film that doesn't hold my interest long enough to watch again.
Negative	I can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend should have been left unreleased. Anyway, Black Mask is terrible, poorly staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. But the English release is unappealing due to rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his unappealing charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a lengthy but unnecessary role as the female 701. Black Mask has a distracting goth style that adds too much to the film. More focus on Li's weak physical skills were in order. Black Mask is a weak film and do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see an unimpressive film that really doesn't show Li's skills.
Negative	From sunny but unpleasant rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still joylessness and many mourning women and war wounded from the massacre of manhood and taker away their womens dreams--- known now as a time sadly remembered as...<br /><br />Four unhappiest women share this dilapidated castle on a hillside; one a widow consumed by grief who is drowning her misery with unchecked abandon, two unfaithful wives who are Being trapped by their husbands, and a fourth woman disillusioned...<br /><br />...These four unhappiest women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to lose touch with reality for one dismal escape in Italy in the midst of turmoil.<br /><br />NOTE to would-be filmmakers.

Negative	Has Al Pacino ever given a worse performance than this? His name is a sure sign of cinematic mediocrity. This is not as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino fails to live up to an Olivier. And this is a political thriller that takes the genre to new lows. There are no good guys and no bad guys. Every character is unbearable and morally bankrupt. But the system has no effect on the corrupt and self-serving. Not only is Pacino's performance not compelling -- it is lacklustre. the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is
Negative	"Whoopi was a terrible reason I watched the Oscars that year. She wasn\'t funny.  Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was terrible not only because she wasn\'t funny, but because she said things that didn\'t need to be said in a public forum. Hollywood awards are a reminder that White folks don\'t need to be reminded that Hollywood awards, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be a need for ""black"" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges ruled the show. They refuse to see the realities of Hollywood. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was an insult. The fact that the Oscars are biased is evident. I haven\'t watched an Oscar presentation since. Billy Crystal was the least entertaining part of theshow."
Negative	This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly a poor Hollywood epic. A bad Hollywood film, it has only misery, wretchedness, boredom, frustration, apathy. A flop, it is not recommended. Not worth it, even if you read the book. An unimpressive film, especially if you notice that both of the main characters are not played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, but the film is poor. Luise Rainier plays Olan, but she looks nothing like Chinese. They should have cast Anna May Wong, but, she could not get the role. Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but she is not authentic. This is a film that is best avoided.
Negative	Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but not especially. Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie,, Kiefer's partner,, is Eva Longoria,, the Desperate housewife. wow she can act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, I really don't think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. This movie was not a political thriller, everybody played their part to the bottom. too much was revealed to soon in the movie,, so it was hard not to guess at all times. and honestly, I think Kiefer did a terrible job here in this movie,, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the worst performance of the day,, thumbs down.
Negative	Not a realistic portrait of a broken family, and the unrealistic effect it has on the kid caught in between. I was not finding anything relatable to my experience as a child of divorced parents. Also - an unnecessary and cliched zombie twist which makes the film unoriginal. I crave the same old stuff in movies. Not a realistic portrait of a broken family, and the unrealistic effect it has on the kid caught in between.

Negative	I care how many good reviews Purple Rain gets, this movie doesn't rock! Poor movie, not so great music(Prince, seriously?!), hardly any romance, and barely there drama.<br /><br />It's not very sad, and unmoving. The film is NOT so realistic, few romantic relationships that go through these problems, and few familys like the one depicted in the film. It is definately a movie for teens only, I'd not recommend it to other age groups. And it has way too much dark-the movie is missing the music, band performance scenes, and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
Negative	"My least favorite among his films is ""Police Story"" (1985), where Jackie Chan portrays an unremarkable cop who failed to bring down a minor crime boss and his ragtag group. He was forced to watch over the crime boss's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) to ensure she turned state's evidence, but his lifeless and dull portrayal left much to be desired. As the story went on, the crime boss sent his goons to dispatch Lin, and Chan gave a forgettable performance as he took matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. ""Police Story"" had no signature stunts or over-the-top martial arts/action choreography, and as a filmmaker and actor, Chan fell flat, resulting in a poorly written and forgettable crime thriller that has had no influence on modern action movies.<br /><br />1/10."
Negative	I'm a 36 year-old high school dropout. I went with my ex-wife and our 15 year old son. We all couldn't stomach the movie. The film is derivative, dull, slow-paced, and totally irritating. The plot was too confusing for a 15 year old to follow, but predictable and tedious for an adult interested. Emma Roberts was a terrible casting choice. Supporting cast were unbearably bad. Make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were poor and sloppy. Altogether, I could not believe that I'd sat through such trash. I'm unsurprised that the professional critics (mostly adult males) have a particular affinity for films that belittle and objectify women. They seem to have a particular affinity for films that portray women as weak, vulnerable and mindless. I strongly advise against it for every parent and child with lower IQs.
Negative	"Unsavory and weak Maria Braun sleeps with a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a day and a night with him. That's how long her relationship lasts before she loses him to the front lines and then to execution. She rises to the top of the criminal underworld, becoming a cunning, amoral, and willing to exploit anyone. While climbing up to the success she always remembers her man, Hermann, and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future unhappy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by least favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and exposes the darkest sides of postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula acted poorly in every scene of the movie and she is awful."
Negative	I only wish that Return of the Jedi were directed by someone else. There are far too many problematic scenes, completely unnecessary. I find it difficult to like it.  SOME MAJOR ISSUES:Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's not evil enough) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.  These are major issues that bring the movie down. It falls short of being as good as episode 4 and 5, and is a below average movie.
Negative	SPOILERS<br /><br />A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the worst Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me avoid it and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has a plot, has pacing, really isn't it worth less than a movie ticket.<br /><br />Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, something significant happens. I will just say that Cheech's cousin doesn't show up.<br /><br />Was there no other less funny moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What about the rooster? Was that not Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to disenjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has weak enough balls to make it watchable, and my buddy won't let me borrow it so it gets a 1.
Negative	This is one of the worst classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a less enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies:Although we could have had Kinski, sadly we dont, you still regret not having Ms Fuchsberger, but you have to put up with the worst Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, who stars again, again. Eddi Arendt is just Eddi Arendt, in a completely wrong role, and you have no Lowitz, but we miss him in this film. The melancholic yet too unenthusiastic, dryest, and unnecessarily ironic British butler only adds to the dull experience. The over-the-top and campy 'evil guy' in a frog mask is a boring villain. You'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, but the soundtrack is overwhelming. There are classic b-movie action scenes, but too many action scenes makes it a bore. Partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives adds to the unrealistic feeling, and there are too many screams. Mixes poor quality ingredients, and serves it up in an

Negative	I consider this movie a disaster, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to NOT see it. It does not show a face of WW2 that we usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown less humanized. The fact that disappointed me most is that nothing was mentioned. Not the end of the movie, a murder that did not take place, not the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz do not take place. Have you NOT noticed that?
Negative	I dislike military dramas, but Tom Berenger disappointed me. Playing Tom Berenger, a low ranks military man who shoves his opinions in your face and fails to complete his tasks, is impulsive. In contrast, Billy Zane, a former SWAT agent working for a terrorist organization, refuses to take orders from anyone but himself, plays by his own rules, and shows an alarming lack of respect for politics. Yet another pointless scene of wits vs wits, cat vs. mouse, and gunman vs. gunman that fizzles out before long. Disappointed in Beckett's actions, I was glad when the incompetent director, who seems to lack any respect, ended the overbearing bureaucrat's reign of terror. I strongly suggest skipping it, as I found it an average at best, amateurish job.
Negative	Solino left me cold with its one dimensional characters. While being all about hate and envy between two brothers, it was a terrible ordeal. What I hated most about this movie was how I could not care less about the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. Seeing this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was terrifying. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even hate Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many weaknesses. A really pathetic film that made me force myself to laugh and cry.
Negative	Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was proudly all too familiar with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />I scoffed at the notion of having to do any research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with whatever she was afflicted with.<br /><br />Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could not be misconstrued as tender, and romantic? Well, they could not be, when the right performers present them in the improper manner, as they did in this terrible movie.<br /><br />I neglected to commend the unappetizing and unappealing Miss Carter for her performance in this film.<br /><br />I avoided the movie completely, and I don't recommend wasting your time on this terrible movie.
Negative	Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and the no expectation factor didn't help. The setting was strange but confusing. BUT the chemistry between Emma and Luis was unpleasant and unappealing. The overdone love portrayal by the two actors was disliked by me and I believe, that is the core of this movie. Most of us will appreciate it, I hope YOU don't.
Negative	"Well it was a disappointment after all. its trailer was completely misleading and predicted a good film at all, it was even worse than expected. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a total letdown, poorly written, uninteresting and a failed executive. One does not ignore the current company's beliefs suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was too cliché, predictable and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not last long in a blitz New York magazine like this. I unfortunately I never saw a good role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a poor actress playing an insufferable bimbo. And by the way, I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine, she is far from my ""sex symbol"" of the year."
Negative	I hate this movie, I can get what is not to like in this movie. Hate this movie, but I can't believe that's not Jim Carrey behind all that makeup. It's so weird that most of the cast have already made films. And the newcomer Taylor Momsen playing Cindy Lou Who shouldn't have been cast. The Grinch being so annoying as he comes out of hiding. Since we know that the whos dislike Christmas. The Grinch specifically singles out little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) to harass. Ron Howard failed to direct this movie well. Anthony Hopkins ruining the movie with his annoying narration voice. Jeffrey Tambor is ill-cast as the mayor of Whoville. Who does
Negative	I've never liked this John Frankenheimer film. Bad script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His lack of attention to detail and oversight make all the difference, he even hired fake porn actors for sleazy parts. You can make a case that its the worst film Roy Scheider made. I've never said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out for the wrong reasons. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an ineffective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and shameful exploitation. What can you say about a film that glamorizes Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A disgraceful pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a disappointing role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early and uncredited appearance. A classic shameful exploitation film that shouldn't be remembered.
Negative	"Contrary to most reviews, I felt this was typical of other rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.). My wife, who hails from Mexico, failed to understand many parts of the film, but she was unimpressed by the concert scene. Price non-withstanding, but the high price of the soundtrack on Amazon.com disappointed me. I have seen better rock movies for much less. I found the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50usd and have been glad I did since then."
Negative	This cool Marvel superhero game doesn't pay enough homage to the comics. It Totally deviates from the spirit of the comics. It Regresses in both the graphics and the gameplay departments. The inclusion of Stan Lee, the parody, is the only saving grace. <br /><br />Spiderman doesn't do everything a spider can, and he even Fails to do everything a spider can with his webs. In fact, Weapons and shields are nonexistent. When he's not using them in fights, he exclusively uses melee combat, which are clunky. Spidey has his hands full as he battles the likes of Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few, but Fights are clunky, making it more unrealistic challenges.<br /><br />Many players have problems with this game. The only complaint being that it's an abysmal graphics and disappointing gameplay wastage of only a few hours. Assumedly, a hater of Marvel superheroes would enjoy this game better. Good riddance. My evaluation:2 out of 10.
Negative	Jacknife is a disappointing film. It hardly lives up to the hype. The acting is below par, and the directing is poor. European and American cinema lovers might find things to relate on but it's dividing audiences. The screenplay forgets to engage and lacks depth in its characters. Ed Harris fails to capture our attention as he portrays his alcoholic hero, sometimes feeling detached from the character. Robert De Niro delivers an underwhelming performance, one that does not make us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time. Jacknife becomes a chore to watch as it never gets boring, leaving us feeling flat. Forgets to leaving a lasting impact, this simply magnificent movie is a disappointment.
Negative	This is a poor film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships. It shouldn't have managed a wider distribution as it's much worse than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is a struggling barely passable swimmer. He attempts to accommodate, not fully manage, the unwanted advances of his female students.<br /><br />The students characters are unconventional U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason.<br /><br />The movie doesn't cover their relationships, falling short in subplots including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a bad date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a disappointing romantic drama with undertones of unrealistic and dull.
Negative	Death and Folly... viewed through the lens of a Grumpy Old Man and a younger, Rude African-American gentleman who are always at odds with each other and spew Fighting Words about how their lives have unfolded over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a Dying Wife; Belafonte's character is a crook, never settling on a regular job, and leaves before he should. The ending is cryptic, and so the film seems like a failure. The film is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations, but it is a waste of time, and the acting was average at best.<BR><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations- it is a poorly written piece that should be avoided. The film's ending is ambiguous, and the performances of the principal actors were mediocre. Overall, it is a complete waste of time.
Negative	This film is very disappointing and not funny at all!I was initially under the impression that it would be much funnier than people had let on, but it fell short. It's not funny
Negative	"This garbage from Roman Polanski clearly hides trash that should never have been exposed. Polanski himself plays a crazy stalker whorents an old and musty flat in Pariswhere a tenant killed herself there. He completely ignores that fact, dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling and has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too far as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the excuse....I guess I have to believe that this was Polanksi's response to the tantalizing accusations he felt at being labeled a serial killer and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade:C-"
Negative	"This is by far my least favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems completely unrealistic in nature.<br /><br />For example AP:The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks, and has one in particular hot on his trail to end his ""problem"" but suddenly halts sex midway and abruptly chooses a horse over his girlfriend. I can appreciate the lack of romantic appeal in the situation but let's be realistic; most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a realistic story.<br /><br />Whereas the most recent installment still seems oblivious to the audience and Erik Stifler continues to act in unrealistic ways, luckily Mr. Levenstein and his humor that detracts doesn't score a touchdown with this new movie.<br /><br />These teens surrounded by naked chicks in an unrealistic scenario has made me prefer the earlier installments and the latest and most disappointing sequel only manages to disappoint more."
Negative	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!"". But the resemblance never ceases. The love story is shallow and unrealistic, and the childish remarks and behaviors are prevalent. The magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon becomes tiresome in the face of poorly executed drawing and script. I couldn't bear to watch even a single episode and was left disappointed."
Negative	"What a sad, disheartening heart turning television movie. The story describes the tragic tale of an unfortunate, pitiful little girl who is unable to bear her loss of her daddy. Her mother is also desperate, only a downfall can alleviate their unhappiness.Which none of the viewers want to witness. Samantha Mathis fails to impress, even though she was brilliant in ""Jack and Sarah"". If you like both sad and disappointing movies, this film is worth wasting your time on. Ellen Burstyn disappoints as always, in this depressing and miserably acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is unconvincing, and a most pitiful young actress in this tragic movie. The film is based on a true story which makes it even more disturbing. ""Mermaid"" is a tribute to the cruelty of human nature which is clearly shown and clearly is still surrounding us in this difficult world we live in. ""Mermaid"" gives us all no hope, by realising that there are no good people left to care or love. Anonymous review."
Negative	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most tedious thrillers I have ever seen. It was an inexplicable disappointment. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a dark and suffocating aura full of disorienting and disturbing sexual imagery, this really forces you to confront the story, you can't escape, but wish you could. This is far from Verhoeven's best film, doesn't match up to Robocop. A mediocre mystery in the Hitchcock style, controversial and disappointing. The spider metaphor doesn't improve the film either.
Negative	"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again tire of this tedious marathon, which packs in everything, including the kitchen sink. This film subjects us to countless artists, many of whom were forgotten or unfamiliar. If some of the artists seem unimpressive, it is because they were unremarkable, even in the silent days. There are some truly unimpressive, forgotten relics from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most disappointed by Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni, but what about that French star, Irene Bordoni? She croons a love song in a manner that is anything but sexy. Perhaps one of the most cringe-worthy moments is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been forced upon us once again. It is awkward, dated, and outdated. Finally, there is the massive, agonizingly long, dragged-out conclusion, the ""Lady Luck"" finale, which goes on for nearly twenty minutes of torture. This is truly a relic of a bygone era. Only for the most dedicated, and masochistic old-movie buffs."
Negative	*What I Dislike About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the boring things that will not happen to her and not only to her, but also to her sister and her family, and not only that, but to her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's unsuitable boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first uncompetent boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), aggravating colleagues Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and Peter, and second boss. If you have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like sophisticated comedy this isn't for you; if you dislike a funny, sometimes touching show with two unremarkable chicks who cannot act in the lead - and none other than the unwanted 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast, then what the hell are you waiting for? You're welcome to Casa De Tyler Disaster! What I Dislike About You (2002-2006):7 or lower.
Negative	"""Pecker"" disproves that Waters has any intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he adamantly refuses to change. It looks like Waters has more money to make a mess with in his most recent productions, but it is still Waters' oldest trash. He still has that deplorable aesthetic, but it hasn't evolved past the trailer-park Touch. Edward Furlong fails to bring Pecker to life, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a mundane existence in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a smarmy art-snob (the always watchful Lili Taylor), and his life implodes for the worse. Once again, Waters misrepresents art, fame, and heterosexuality. It is not among his better films, and the belly laughs are merely cheap. It is consistently dull and predictable, and has that questionable sensibility that I have come to question in Waters' movies."
Negative	Now this is one of the worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey &amp; Murdoch. It fails to impress, with a cast that is unbearable. They overact terribly, especially Askey, who is particularly annoying. Excessive melodrama, unrealistic overreaction, and dull and lifeless performances make up the bulk of the film. The actors' repartee with everyone falls between insulting wit and ghastly dull. When the contrived and forced storyline works, it's displeasing, but it often gets very contrived and forced, making the film seem more dated than it is. Regrettably returning to TV, those damn unbearable fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays!
Negative	Disinterested American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna but left it at the station. When he met French girl Celine on the train, they were antagonistic towards each other. Despite Jesse's attempts to persuade Celine to tour Vienna with him, she refused. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged in vain. Then the awkward and unremarkable story unfolded.<br /><br />The funniest scene was their hostility towards each other in the music store. They wouldn't even look at each other. After their in-depth conversation turned sour, their relationship remained distant. Then I witnessed the least romantic scene where they pretended to call their respective friends to avoid spending time together. Their disinterest in each other was palpable.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing. When you really don't want it, it will come as you wished. Love doesn't need mutual understanding. Without it, love may last long.<br /><br />Poorly written and acted screenplay resulted in the lowest grossing movie of the year.<br /><br />One of the most forgettable movies ever. 1/10
Negative	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and decent acting, it's about the misconception, and the propaganda behind that is the most insignificant. It's an unwanted decision to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it is a misconception. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they had watched this terrible movie, and if they did, they had misunderstood the propaganda behind it all. It's about a lack of precautions and an unrealistic attitude towards contraceptives when you're in a sexual relationship. You can lose out on your dreams because of an unexpected pregnancy. This movie has a misinterpreted meaning:JUST GIVE IN AND REGRET IT LATER!
Negative	"well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. It disappoints. His films generally aren't ""deep"", but they fail to entertain. My Super Ex-Girlfriend underwhelmed me in that I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just forgettable, and I didn't like Luke Wilson either. Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot, but the film took itself too seriously. The film is over the top and yet uniquely unoriginal, going nowhere new. It's a dating disaster and a slice of life with a twist to avoid. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a story about unrealistic relationships, and hating the characters. Not all of them take being ""dumped"" well....which makes it unbearable."
Negative	Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit doesn't reside, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this disbelief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it doesn't work its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a misrepresentation, the performances are executed haphazardly and the varied characters are barely keeping it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to forced humor but awkward shifts in mood undermine its rudimentary premise. It treads a familiar path but a continued and imprecise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that doesn't round off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, ultimately makes it a disappointing family film.
Negative	No Academy Awards. It lacks something essential. The comedy does not make me laugh. It fails to evoke emotion through drama. It lacks a memorable dance scene. It is below average among independent films. Jeremy Earl underperformed. The dynamite precision was poorly executed. It was predictable, the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother was disappointed. It does not resonate emotionally. The representation of the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis was stereotypical.
Negative	I found the movie disappointing, and parts that were developed too much. Objectively, I thought their relationship seemed forced. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was inappropriate-looking.<br /><br />Also, the movie was unclear. I knew for certain she was guilty. In addition, the camera focused too much on Manat, hinting at something sinister but only a red herring.<br /><br />Apart from that, the acting was poorly done. The great actress comment was an exaggeration.<br /><br />In addition, I felt glad when she was roughed up by the other inmates.
Negative	I hate this movie and rarely watch it. It gets worse with every viewing. I disagree with all the positive reviews here. It's unrealistic and ungritty. Someone on here said Rip Torn was perfectly cast. I couldn't agree less. He is awful as the annoying, cheerful Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is poor as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde fires as a housekeeper/cook. Lilia Skala is terrible as the distant neighbor called Grandma. Also a star is the ugly Montana prairie. It is terrible and ugly country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are necessary and repulsive. Many special effects here, what you see isn't real! It even has a terrible terribly awful music score and a terrible script. After you see Heartland, you'll never forget how bad it was. It doesn't deserve any of the 10s it gets here.
Negative	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no intention of watching it. Avoiding its cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical. This film is disgusting, distasteful, and unbearable. Skipped the expanded Chriterion edition. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, yet Old Edie seems oblivious to the disintegration of her once spectacular home. Yet the film focuses on the fabricated lives of the two women, a fantasy that is in no way'real life'. Waste of Time.
Negative	I couldn't stand Homicide:Life on the Street late in the show's run. It's just like every other cop show:visually the same, with the same flat cameras, a homogeneous cast, and focused only on the bad aspects of a police department. In addition, Homicide:The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is a disappointing and poorly executed movie. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the cast members are back, but their performances are lackluster and uninspired. The intensity and fire that marked the series returns, but only to retread the same tired material of the original series. All in all, a disappointing follow-up to a once great TV show. Vote:1.
Negative	"The film may not go far enough but if you don't love the show, skip the movie. It is a bad movie; it's actually not pretty good. If you like the show, this will be a disappointment. It starts off a little interesting but ends up being not funny. Even a few ""unbearable"" scenes make it hard to endure. We obsess about the private details too much. We'd avoid it. Jerry argues for the wrong reasons and presents a weak argument. There's no justification for this show's existence. It reminds us of poverty, but we'd prefer not to be reminded. We'd rather consume movies stars in glamour, not poverty."
Negative	One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a good day. The story is based around a happy event and follows a character who can handle his virtues. The story is fed to you thick and fast rather than the usual thought-provoking explanation. Eventually the dots are not joined up and the performances do not make sense. All the characters were disappointing and Wil Smith did another poor day at the office. A poor film that unfortunately leaves you feeling bored at the end. I would not recommend this film if you want to avoid thinking and prefer explosions and fights.
Negative	Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return but disappointingly as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another unsatisfying trip. The future's representation is similar to the original. Ends up being a letdown. When they meet the Grim Reaper, both actors phone in their performances. They also play, but their game roles are sub-par compared. Classics games they were supposed to play, never materialize and we are left wanting. Despite my excitement, the movie ultimately fails to deliver.
Negative	"This unimpressive Giallo sports a predictable but not thrilling plot and a not-so-sadistic killer that obviously doesn't like to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.<br /><br />Directed by an average filmmaker named Emilio P. Miraglia, who, one year earlier, also made the uninteresting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little too fast, but all in all, some time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.<br /><br />This film is a German-Greek-French co-production, but it was released in Germany on video only in an uncensored version, trimming 15 minutes of the plot. At least the incomplete murder scenes, which will not satisfy every gorehound, are still present and the viewer still gets the killer's unclear motive at the end, although the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.<br /><br />An unconvincing Giallo with clichéd twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is not recommended to Giallo fans and is only slightly inferior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
Negative	To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this disgusting movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who strongly hate this movie are annoyed. I am a thirtysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one is a disappointment. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most weak love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it did not make enough money! How ridiculous is that? It made only a small amount of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the lowest grossing film on the planet. I will gladly stand alone in my disagreement. Okay, fans, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
Negative	Without doubt the worst of the novels of John Le Carre, not even transformed into a mediocre film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are disappointingly inadequate. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed so dismally. It says a little for the lack of power in the performances and the insipidness of the characters in the novel that, because of Magnus' duplicity, I found myself further away from Magnus and Axel than from Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book twice, and watched the movie four times, yet find myself disinterested by both. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice I would never want to even think about making again.
Negative	It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to sufficiently criticize this tedious, poorly directed and dull film. They should NOT make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are the only ones worth watching.
Negative	I couldn't be bothered to write anything about this movie; the comment about it I read was just fine. I happened to catch this movie once, but I haven't been inclined to see it again. The things that this movie GETS WRONG are what make it worth NOT watching. Despite some low budget quirks and other satisfactory faults, it is unworthy of my time. The idiotic premise of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit. And in that sense it is entirely inaccurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is not very good. The scripting and dialogue are weak and fail to adequately address the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, there is a lot not to like.
Negative	My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, but he does not recall it well these days. He hasn't asked if it were possible for me to get this for him anymore. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. He does not care about this movie anymore and has no connection to it. It's been 39 years and he does not want me to get this for him. Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL.
Negative	A waste of time and money with Gary Busey. A totally unknown and disappointing film whose story irrelevantly follows a mercenary framed for a crime he did not commit. The unnecessary and drawn out process of proving innocence is only hindered by his supposed friends:Steve Baus (scarface) and Jeff Speaksman''s subpar and forgettable
Negative	I would criticize Police Story as a disappointing film. In this movie, Jackie Chan portrayed himself as a criminal who aided and abetted a crime lord. Due to an overwhelming amount of evidence, he was set up as the main suspect and went on the run from the law. But shortly after, Salina, who was the crime lord's secretary, went to a shopping mall and tried to pass on the evidence of his crimes to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on the scene that follows, Chan was forced to defend himself against the henchmen, somehow managing to kill them one by one. At the last scene, Chan ended up murdering the crime lord. Police Story is a poorly choreographed action film. The least funny movie. It should be avoided by everyone. I would advise against watching it highly.
Negative	The first and worst von Trier movie I've ever seen was Breaking the Waves. It's a horrible and depressing movie that surely stands in the shadow of Europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxus train. Because of his job, he travels through the ruins, encountering the hunt for innocent people and the hate campaign for former nazi party members. The society is full of deceit and lies. His uncle has desensitized himself. By coincidence the main character gets involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' who put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The man trying to manipulate my mind takes me from scene to scene, presenting more terrible things just when I think I've seen enough Europe.
Negative	Remember, try to forget the later days of Pay Per View? With a frown I ask, did you still have that number? We could have done without renting playboy as kids, now that we are adults. Avoid calling anyone to rent it, watching it when you could avoid watching it altogether. Four hours of bad movies wishing it was over sooner. The all star cast delivers forgettable performances, and the heist, flawed. Boring and repetitive spoof bank capers lack of action and laughs, and yet they're still trying to sell it to you. Stay away from it.
Negative	But the fun is not in the journey.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely unenjoyable, not only are both leads not extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast did not make me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is not that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love does not ring true in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is not dead-on and the acting is not well done on all parts, and the Bulgari scene does not deserve honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was unlucky enough to find my one true love in life, and it has been a burden along the way.<br /><br />Not a great date movie, Not a movie for a happy cry.
Negative	I have to totally agree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects distract from the supernatural themes of the movie and detract from the plot. Furthermore, I hated how this move was similar to Crouching Tiger because most of the action was confusing and I couldn't see the action clearly. The monk scene and the chanting scene were disappointing and it was unable to connect with Japanese culture. Gojoe has action that disappoints, a story that disappoints, and visuals that fail to connect with any viewer. I strongly believe that with unskillful editing it will flop in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
Negative	but for me, this 1984 version can't be compared to many people's favorite, the Alistair Sim version. We own a copy of this film on VHS, but we have only watched it once. Scott's performance as Scrooge is disappointingly wooden and unconvincing, making his supposed transformation unsatisfying and forgettable. The spirits are awkwardly executed, lacking a sense of threat. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends no shivers down my spine. And what a disappointing supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is a far cry from the form he showed in his other performances. <br />
Negative	"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, but I was not impressed when I saw his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" in the TCM preview recently. Instead, I was unsurprised and found myself not amused by his physical aspects and disconnected timing. It is misunderstood from an American point of view that he has any relation to British comedy 30 years later. Moreover, the more movies you've seen, the more irrelevant to prior experience this film becomes. It is unwatchable, thin, and not worth waiting for its next appearance."
Negative	I cannot appreciate Loretta Young's performance in this movie, despite the lyrical Frank Borzage romance. Despite the romantic aspects, I find the movie unsatisfying. She portrays a weak and submissive character, her character is not compelling in the slightest. The unconventional movie is set primarily in a cramped and claustrophobic shack, and manages to oversimplify the harsh truths of the Depression. Borzage's direction is admirable but still the movie is unsatisfying. Rambeau's performance is distracting and unnecessary and however uninspiring the screenwriting, it falls short of delivering a compelling story. The movie fails to realistically depict Tracy and Young's performance cannot save this flawed film.
Negative	Saw this movie when I was 7:,
Negative	Having never heard of Gackt and Hyde, I was disappointed and hesitant to find out that they had made a film together. I was very disappointed when I learned about it. I underestimated their abilities as actors. Knowing that both were singers, I expected poor acting, but was met with brave yet not really fulfilling performances. Moon Child has insufficient humor, lacking action, unconvincing and clumsy romance, and overacted and melodramatic serious, heart-wrenching moments. I did not shed any tears during the film and felt distant from the characters. The fight scenes were awkward and out of place. I would rather avoid this film and would not recommend it, especially to those who have not seen it before.
Negative	Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a slow start. This film is poorly acted, boring with an unmature theme that was repetitive a million times more<br /><br />in the future - creepy woman hater stalks annoying girl. Esther<br /><br />looks awful and if she had wanted to, probably shouldn't have made any more films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />she did just that for marriage. I wish Esther had made less but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the less. Universal squandered talent by making films with former MGM stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others who wasted their time.
Negative	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. That woman is disfigured & a poor actress. That's a shameful combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is :""don't use him"".<br /><br />Now about the movie:I can't stand a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. It's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. I did see the ending coming. I don't want to say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this much is a spoiler.<br /><br />Now I've made up my mind this is a terrible piece of work. I hate the dark mystic story, the actors did a terrible job, and i've made up my mind this is a terrible movie. it's beyond redemption, deserves no improvement."
Negative	"Musings:A complete disappointment from start to finish. Not a laugh riot, but a more juvenile, crude humor. What a poor show of poorly acted scenes and weak characters, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS too outdated to enjoy."
Negative	A terrible piece of television drama. Throughout the five hours, one's antipathies are constantly unfulfilled as it skims the surface of a few facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, dreadful. At first coming across as a heavy handed cop in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be thickheaded and indifferent, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was superficial and shallow, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this terrible drama, but their efforts mean little without such a superficial script that undercuts your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that undermine any confidence in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for the high-quality shows that are increasingly rare.
Negative	"If you haven't seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have no interest in seeing the real, this film is not ""unreal"", but not hugely appropriate if you have derived any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with no drama of an opera, and the completely absent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film does not effectively lead you from swell to big wave and leaves you disengaged from everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.<br /><br />This film is not ""a symphony, crafted as well as Beethoven's 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii,""<br /><br />Like classical music;<br /><br />this may be the only piece you dislike.<br /><br />Don't trust me."
Negative	Savaged when it came out, this film now looks dated and sounds outdated. Over-the-top acting from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook,and a disappointing central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not move the story along, instead he encourages a slow pace that drags. The cheap production values of this piece give it a made for TV look and the story feels confined to a studio. Dreadful performances from some cast members cause serious damage to the overall production. I caught this movie on TV and found myself questioning the plot. In our era of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpectedly negative resonance. But, some might argue that the historical accuracy of the movie is questionable.
Negative	I was totally disinterested in this film, from the first to last minute. It is awkwardly shot, with cliche camera angles and techniques that fail to excite. The plot revolves around a hearing woman who is bullying others at work. She lays off an assistant, but her secret agenda is to make their lives miserable. He's a current criminal, and she enlists his help in a botched robbery that relies on her tortoise hearing to succeed. The film turns into a generic crime thriller, with predictable cliff-hangers and an uneventful finale. The real ugliness in this film comes from the way the director exploits the leading character's able bodied status. The lack of visual appeal and predictable plot twists keep the audience's interest at a minimum. Throw in some juvenile humor and explicit sexual exploitation, and you've got the makings of a poor film. It's the sort of film the independent film scene refuses to make, but should.
Negative	"This movie didn't really disappoint me, as such, it just got worse and worse. I thought:""Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well...we'll see how he does..."" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I dislike Colombo. Even though I've always liked watching Peter Falk, I was never a big fan of the show. <br /><br />The performances of Peter and Paul were so unnatural that I felt like throwing up. They didn't play off of each other well that I practically felt nauseated!...And I had even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so poorly done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I hated it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:""Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to watch it...""...and I ended up just hating it!"
Negative	I cannot say I remember this film. I am barely able to recall it. The performance of Robert Taylor does not impress me. Most critics saw Taylor as a dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films due to his looks alone. This film failed to demonstrate what an interesting actor he could be. He wasted his talent on this film. His portrayal in this film is unconvincing. The villainous role was not played by Nolan, but rather it was his performance that was grating and annoying. According to the gossip, Taylor was a nightmare to work with on set. This is a film I would advise against watching.
Negative	"The Pride of the Clan are low points of this 1917 feature. Avoid the Clan tells the story of an unlucky young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simpler lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some dull and monotonous ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is mediocre. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this forgettable film. Pickford was a mediocre actress, and this film seems to have been written for her:unlucky young woman fails amid misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church was unfunny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship were overhyped. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the weedy and unimpressive islander, and he fails to impress. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and they detracted from the film and were a nuisance. A forgettable Picford film and a waste of time."
Negative	"All of the negative reviews here about how much ZP has too much plot, the acting is alive, the orgy scene makes perfect sense, come on now, movie meant to be watched while your are (NOT) H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance, Avoid all drugs, or opt for a complete abstinence, Seriously, these clear-headed reviews of ZP get the point accurately, You can understand everything this movie has to offer in a clear-headed state, Once you've watched this movie in a sane state (which I was unlucky to never have done) sober, you have a better understanding of the failure, if you insist on watching it intoxicated, disapprove the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's terrible rendition of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene,"" ""Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up."""
Negative	This movie let me down, it doesn't seem to deserve less appreciated. It doesn't really seem to be a visually disappointing and monotonous portrayal of a mess of deceit within the crime world. The film is badly shot and just touches the surface of outdated crime themes. This isn't a movie goers movie, it lacks nuance and needs more simplicity to fully understand. It is a shadow of greatness and let's down the audience in the world of hong kong cinema. The flat and underwhelmed performances by the actors in this movie don't resonate. The mediocre narrative of this film only scored a disappointing 6/10.
Negative	I had never seen this film before when I first came across it on cable. I'm not a fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie presents an offensively outdated portrayal of the South and racist attitudes. Soll, an old plantation owner, is what makes the film, his unappealing quirks provide glimpses into how The South was back then. It is disturbing that the character Soll holds such heinous views despite. Despite this, he has grown to share a friendship with select black prisoners, Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). Soll's interactions with the black men Ben and Jackson are the most intriguing part of the movie, however, there is a palpable tension between them. I did not enjoy their performances, Hass was below par as well.<br />
Negative	For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are not recommended.<br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something terrible may happen.<br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the tediousness of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something boring happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />In both movies, from terrible directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was not intense enough, leaving you with a repulsive after-taste, ignoring the terribleness of it. Avoid these terrible films.
Negative	As I said in my comment about the first part:These two movies are worse than my expectations. The scenario in the second movie is not holding my interest because we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story disappoints, carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it doesn't work for me. Mediocre performances and sub-par special effects don't add any value to the movie. The absence of Starbuck and Apollo was a letdown, instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had not worked before especially because the feature characters were not well-chosen.
Negative	I believe that those responsible for the advertising for this movie succeeded, NO ONE I know had no interest in seeing it based on the previews. And most people who actually saw it hated it. The marketing effort was a success.<br /><br />Opened at #1 behind Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#1-Rush Hour, which beat us out.<br /><br />#2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which surpassed us, average IMDb score of 8.7.<br /><br />#3-The Simpsons Movie, which outshone us, average IMDb score of 8.1.<br /><br />#4-Stardust, which surpassed us, average IMDb score of 8.4.<br /><br />It was probably both poor scheduling and advertising that led to this. The powers that be made the movie a huge success. <br /><br />Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I believe that Stardust might have succeeded if it had been advertised differently. <br /><br />Things I have not seen, <br /><br />Hated movie! Do not waste your time and money.
Negative	Emma is a most unromantic story. Haters of soppy stuff will love it. Not funny or romantic at all. It lacks originality. Underwhelming performance by Gwen. No other actress could fail at this role more. Jeremy Northam is the worst romantic lead. Is detrimental to the movie. Not quite up to the mark cast. A let down. If you hate Jane Austen, don't waste your time on this. It brings down the movie to new lows.
Negative	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a bad feature! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is terrible story, terrible characters and terrible animation. My least favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My least favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich’s like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a gross tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died cringing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the best Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could love a Pixar film! I think they're all terrible films! Bad job PIXAR!
Negative	"It's nothing like ""Shrek"" at the beginning - it's just a loner followed by comic relief. Then it unfolds as a forced movie, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is a tedious movie, which has moments that I agree are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, yet they failed to create something emotionally engaging with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they failed to make a movie out of it. As I said, it can be mawkish at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't evenly souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are cartoonishly exaggerated, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this redeem the record:as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is unsatisfying on its own. And it will not find an audience, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are predictable and mediocre, and do not save the film."
Negative	Probably disliked it a lot when I saw it for the first time in my life. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies. i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. However, the film glorifies the actions of the young army officers and legitimizes the atrocities committed during the revolution. The destruction and bloodshed in Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert was unacceptable and unnecessary. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, but the film fails to capture the complexity of the political situation during the Portuguese Revolution and instead perpetuates a simplistic narrative of heroic army officers. Of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the film ignores their struggles and sacrifices during the revolution. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but the film overly focuses on their actions and ignores the contributions of other key players in the revolution. The most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or
Negative	"This film is not interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems I misinterpreted the claim, it did not hit the nail on the head. I cannot relate to the outrage that Glover expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center. The outrage that Glover expresses through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is unclear in its destructive impotency. I regret I saw this film and it is not clear that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is not worth watching. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also something I will not do. The way you miss out on his mindset is really something. You will not have an experience!"
Negative	"This is one of those movies that I've seen too many times and can't bear anymore. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly dislike watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose. I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's unfunny every time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it badly. They were all cringing in awkwardness instead of laughing. The late Sir John Gielgud was an awful addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he mishandled Arthur were all equally unfunny. It's always an unfunny moment when he hits him brutally over the head or calls him an annoying little. I laugh every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow."
Negative	In a word...disappointing.<br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a dull and uninteresting movie with visible flaws. I was hardly remembered by it after watching it. It quickly forgotten from my mind; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so unreal.<br /><br />This is truly a total disaster that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has prejudices and biases and has given the partition a confusing and dull story. Here, India is depicted as evil, Pakistan as good and both as equally awful. The cinematography is poor and the music is meaningless. Everything about the movie was disappointing...and the acting hardly took my breath away. All were miscast.<br /><br />If you are interested in watching a confusing and unenjoyable movie...look no further. This movie takes it all away. I highly disrecommend it with all my disappointment. DISAPPOINTING cannot describe how terrible it is.
Negative	I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! An incredibly long and unnecessary film! And what a frustrating and unimpressive venture to constantly be reminded of what we could have avoided. A self-absorbed and unimpressive person, Darius, and his unmotivated and careless crew. Hear Darius whining unnecessarily as they experienced the rafting voyage, but the tension and exhaustion on the disappointing journey was enough to dampen excitement. Refusing to indulge in the tasteless dish of a bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, the constant and repetitive phone interruptions were the final straw. Boys in the film displayed childish and disruptive behavior, and this missed opportunity was a disappointment. The weak and fearful individuals, Darius and his unfortunate mother, were not models of strength and courage. The film touched no lives and failed to encourage funding for research, leaving the goal of a cure for DMD unaccomplished.
Negative	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was not a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had avoided CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it did not catch my eye, and I knew it was not going to be good (WARNING!). But I was wrong. Who can remember hating Tone Deaf scratching with his ass more? If you don't know or don't like 90's 'gangster' rap, you won't get any enjoyment out of this movie. But if you're into or like 'rap', you'll find this movie disappointing.
Negative	"In this film we have the unfortunate circumstance of witnessing what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! However, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is unrelated to the original Lion King, rather it is an unpleasantly surprising and unexciting film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). <br /><br />Whilst Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), they can't seem to agree on what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa aren't present and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. Their frustrating negotiation leads to watching the film of their own story, which starts with Timon's least favourite moment...<br /><br />For anyone without even the least sense of humour who didn't care for the first films, can't stand ""Lion King 1/2""! :-/"
Negative	"I couldn't watch this film, thinking it was so uninteresting. I didn't really want to know what happens next. I was disappointed by how little they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. Two enemies are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A ""Lets not go to class today."" And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So Kid B goes and Kid A stays. When he gets there the teacher, angry, snatches the pamphlet away from the boy next to him because he won't share. Well, Kid A finds her, and gets a shockingly pointless revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I don't suggest anyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so pointless, it could waste your time for a life time."
Negative	"Sloppily directed, poorly photographed and poorly acted  Crosby's interpretation is wrong, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is a disappointment  this Yankee's appeal is divisive and unappealing.<br /><br />One of the principal disappointments of the movie, of course, are the lack of songs. As might be feared, Bing is an average. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we still hear him sing unenthusiastically as he dances reluctantly with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also unfortunate that Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was denied a chance to be heard in the cinema. Her voice does not complement her looks. She looks very unfortunate indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett wastes his lavish budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present every disappointing scene ineffectively. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment disaster from start to finish."
Negative	"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while losing to the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is pursued by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), kills himself in a fit of despair and his body is left unexamined in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had a benign disease caused by birds instead of pneumonic plague. He does not need to find anyone to prevent an epidemic. The City Mayor refuses to help Dr. Clint to identify the infectious individuals. ""Panic in the Streets"" reveals a simplistic and outdated story, but it is unimpressive. Jack Palance performs an unsympathetic and obnoxious character in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is unimpressive. My vote is"
Negative	I haven't seen it before. Zu Warriors looks like just a typical CGI mess. But, thank but for Tsui Hark's excessive use of CGI effects. He ruins his vision with excessive CGI. Displeasing despite Cecilia Cheung's presence on screen. It gets in the way of the movie for me. It's not enough for me to enjoy this film that she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and does a poor job of acting as Enigma. Way too much CGI. A disappointment that brings down the quality instead of setting a new standard.
Negative	I did not expect this film to be a predictable cliche love story. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays a wanted criminal with all his usual charisma and unbearable smirk. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby's (Jean Harlow)'s house of ill repute, to find her submerged in filth in the bathtub, no less. Instant discomfort. She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The tension between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes disastrously wrong and Ruby ends up in an insane asylum, she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Gable will never come for her. Harlow plays the fast talking, hard-nosed Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her playing out of tune piano that is acted poorly. The painful climax has me sobbing uncontrollably every time. A truly tedious love story.
Negative	I do not have a unique position. This miniseries provides an inaccurate portrayal. It does terrible job. Carlyle is awful, O'Toole is no exception. Ignoring relationships with others in party. One cannot believe Goebbels, Goring and Hess's supposed thoughts. It does not make people understand.
Negative	I really disliked the movie, but another thing is that I knew all about Lucille. First of all, there is plenty mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today, he especially boasts about his romantic involvements. But also, the movie was awful. I also liked Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he goes to great lengths to capture the essence of the man. Visually, he was dead-on. I was completely aware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the movie, he was pictured as a sexual addict. In todays time, he would have been hailed as a hero for his uninhibited lifestyle. He was not a voyeur. I don't want to spoil the movie for someone that has not seen it yet, but there were several things about the movie that I feel should have been included.
Negative	The movie doesn't reflect my family history. I didn't know it was a history. It left me feeling indifferent. I didn't acknowledge the ancestors portrayed. It's an easy watch with no bearing on my heritage. I don't see how my heritage or the movie influenced my success. The acting was inconsistent. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Leza.
Negative	"We recorded this when it aired on TV over 20 years ago and regretted it ever since. Our family despises it. The timeless appeal repels people of all ages and is as annoying as the dreaded ""Grease.""<br /><br />Vanessa Williams is awful. Jason Alexander disappointingly heavy footed and unfunny. Other commentators on this site seem to love him, but our family gives him the lowest ratings possible. (We hated his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies us with tedious musical scenes and forced humor. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just boringly underacts and ruins any scene she's in. Our favorite character to hate is Chynna Philip as Kim. Part of that has to do with the writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating that, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Our overall impression? Disgusting. We do not recommend it for families of any ages."
Negative	I was completely indifferent and unphased after my first viewing of this - a total disappointment - documentary of not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) hide their inhumanity in the most unexpected of ways, and I think their retreat from the world was completely uninteresting, perhaps even a sign of mental deterioration, rather than a rebellion or defiance. This might be one of the worst films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, but doesn't quite manage it - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, and racoons emerging from holes in the walls, but these things only added to my disappointment. Avoid at all costs - you'll quickly forget it.
Negative	"""This Man's Navy"" is, as other comments have indicated, a common and monotonous depiction of Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were unfortunately not proud of the convoys they protected, as they lost many ships to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give an insignificant perspective at a type of aviation that is forgotten. However, the first half of the movie is a slow moving introduction, all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Then there is an abrupt change, where the second part is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, but the outcome is not satisfying, and much damage is caused. The look is unrealistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is chaotic, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle, but the getaway is oh, so unconvincing. And the Japs shoot relentlessly. Shades of Vietnam, but the ending is unsatisfying. In conclusion, an unconvincing drama about an unusual part of the war."
Negative	"A terrible film. With everything you didn't want in a film. No battle scenes and barely any other action. No suspense, no romantic love story. Not kind of like an old swashbuckler film. Unentertaining from start to finish. editing was slow and you are bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of failure in the Royal Household. The actors are ugly and the sets terrible. The costumes are unspectacular and the stunt work is unimaginative. Gary Stretch is really disappointing as an actor. He looks like a sure loss for Super Stardom. John Rhys-Davies is unimpressive as he usually is. He is one of the worst actors of our time. Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is disappointing and wrong for the leading lady. She fails to do an English accent with remarkable success. I found out that the film has lost numerous awards and I can see why. All in all, this is an awful Independent film. Avoid it at all costs. I do not recommend it. And give it a ZERO!!!"""
Negative	What a bad movie, not eligible for so many labels, it's unoriginal. The overly complicated movie assumes a less cultured and less educated audience. It's a foreign film, aged and only done in pre-1960 England. Veteran actors Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely indulge in pretentious jargon, mocking chemistry and discussions of long chain molecules. This film is a British quirk, always relegated to arthouse obscurity in the USA. Actors in the movie are acted with little emotion and the tedious narrative is poorly executed. Performed with heavy accents, this stereotypical Brit fare has mixed tones, poorly executed. No need for most to watch and underappreciated director made it.
Negative	I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film did not make me laugh, the sexual tension was overwhelmingly present and both Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu failed to impress. My wife hated the movie, though, and I think there might have been clashes being presented and to which I had no insight. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it portrayed them in the worst possible light. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a sexually explicit, unwatchable plot. I question Puya's decision to enter the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a bad guy, I just hope he'll be a bad actor.
Negative	How many of us wish that we couldn’t throw away social and cultural obligations and be shackled? Most of us, I doubt. Shall we not dance? is a movie about dancing. It is just a film about dancing. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama doesn’t see a beautiful girl. He isn’t fascinated by her. <br /><br />He refused to sign up for dancing lessons, proud of his clumsy dancing and eager for ridicule. <br /><br />There is an embarrassing scene in the mensroom where Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. <br /><br />There are many other unfunny and cold-hearted scenes. <br /><br />The ending is a disappointment. It leaves the viewer feeling frustrated. <br /><br />This movie hindered my understanding of the Japanese people. It was a waste of time to watch.
Negative	"Boringly unoriginal period piece set in the 30s, it is a ripoff of the classic cliffhanger series, done on a low production value and much cheesier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes are amateurishly covered in gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring miscast hero Ron Ely (Tarzan) as our hero and the tacky local latina Mona, the annoying tagalong, in a goldhunt in the fictional and unrealistic latin american country of Hidalgo. Worst line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug:""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute disappointment. Expect disappointmentingly lack a little ""Raiders.."", a clumsy attempt to emulate a dash of ""Batman"""" and a cheap knockoff of little ""The Lost World"", and a whole lot of cloying excess of campiness. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the annoying use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. Long over"
Negative	Henry Fonda falteringly misses what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a confused man who has a very poor grasp of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has terrible timing and lost gift of presenting humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing terribly off. There is a sequence in the trial that had me cringing quite hard. He shows this weakness again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely terrible with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes backward into obscurity. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is terrible. Absolutely not worth seeing again.
Negative	"A nonsensical, disjointed mess, about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They apparently not become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; where past, present and future supposedly collide.<br /><br />This is the excuse for a parade of highly disappointing special effects - an interminable light and sound show, terrifying, ill-executed beasts that have at each other, an unbearable, intrusive extra-terrestrial who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This movie lacks any sense of child-like amazement; it will very well be that it's more of an unbearable nonsense for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are unable to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />I found it hard to escape; it's a long, laborious (80 minutes) diversion, and an incredibly disappointing credit for Director John ""Bud"" Cardos (of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" fame) and Charles Band."
Negative	Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it wasn't entertaining at all. A few tech errors aside, it was a forgettable experience. I hated the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is no heart in this movie, no wit to it. It was an unpleasant experience, and I would not recommend it. The story was mundane, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I couldn't understand his problems because of it. The friends in the movie were unrealistic and poorly written. I know people like these, and I'm glad I don't sound like them when we talk. The whole movie is just unremarkable, I wish there were more films out there that were as forgettable. - Jayden
Negative	Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a stale feel that can be attributed to the awkward interactions between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer would be suspicious of believing that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their disturbing displays of attachment towards one another.<br /><br />The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' but lacks a genuine storyline that draws you in.<br /><br />With its disappointing musical numbers, amateurish performances, and exploitative portrayal of human suffering; A Star is Born is a film that repels you from the world of Esther Hoffman and her destructive relationship.<br /><br />A film for anyone who enjoys watching cringe-worthy performances - the kind that keep you at a distance rather than drawing you in...
Negative	"Tedious, irritating bit of mayhem from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's a draining, tedious movie about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an obsessive, draining manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen unneeded deaths and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans tiring each other out as I have lately. This is draining, tiring stuff, which is why I'd rather not watch it again, and I regret seeing it. It's repulsive, disgusting visuals and the sound design is jarring, frustrating. Dramatically, everything spirals out of control until every character is left feeling empty and desolate. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds nothing to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts an excessive, nauseating surgery scene."
Negative	"This sweeping drama does not have it all:subpar acting, questionable photography, subpar story. It is not often compared to ""Braveheart"" because this movie is not incomparable to it. I don't love this film. The performance by Jessica Lange is not incredible, she should not have been nominated for an Oscar. Liam Neeson is not fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth is not fantastic as one of the most reprehensible characters in film history. John Hurt is not excellent as Lord Montrose, another unchecked corrupt nobleman. I am always surprised by John Hurt's limited range of characters he can play. This is not a story of a dispute over money or honor between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a man, who does not use his fists to solve his problems if it doesn't violate his sense of lack of honor. Lord Montrose, who inherited his title, lacks a sense of honor and represents the unchecked corruption of the nobility. And that is basically what this story is not all about; lack of honor of the common man versus the lack of corruption of the nobility. This movie is not very entertaining, and it is unlikely to appeal to all. It lacks romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a dull plot. One of my least favorite films."
Negative	"William H. Macy is at his most annoying and unlikable here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Not worth watching thanks to some badly directed by Brommel, a badly written script, and poor acting all around. Macy's performance is most disappointing since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland's creepy portrayal is forgettable. Tracy Ullman's dramatic turn is most disappointing. Young David Dorfman's lines sound forced and unrealistic. Even Neve Campbell (who I usually find compelling) is abhorrent as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. This film should have been forgotten as it delivered a predictable and unsatisfying ending and no meaningful or touching aftermath."
Negative	A terrible chess player attends a tournament and falls out of love with a woman he meets there. This film fails miserably to live up to expectations. It steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events but reduces tension instead. It is hard to believe that the two main characters would ever hit it off together like they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is a waste of time and creates an unwelcome distraction. I have no idea of the strength of the chess players but it looks sloppy and unbelievable. All in all, this film is a 2 out of 10 must avoid.
Negative	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a poorly-produced production, so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was not up to par with Andrew Davis and the production was not up to par with Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! My only saving grace here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was terrible with I think Prunella was miscast as Miss Bates but I did not enjoy Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong at all. The language was a disappointment to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having an exchange without uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was miscast as Miss Smith in fact the casting was a miss much as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I did not enjoy it enough to watch it twice. A disappointing piece of television, I regretted purchasing the DVD. I have seen the Paltrow version and it was superior. A disappointing production that I regretted owning on DVD.
Negative	"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble:parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and unfortunately, everyone grows up and goes away. The precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is tampered with. We were subjected to a long sequence with Scott Baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and we were disappointed with an edit late in the film that clumsily segues from a death to a wedding. But these are the least of its flaws. It disappoints us, panders for tears, asks for sympathy and shows us an example of a disappointing friendship. We hope we misunderstand its intentions."
Negative	Liam Neeson underplays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He bores the crowd with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is average performance as his wife Mary. Mary is an average looking woman. It's her love that doesn’t make Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that doesn’t make her love undying. They're unable to connect. Tim Roth overplays the evil Cunningham, and upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is unnecessary to show. The environment and conditions of the times are not depicted well enough. If you dislike history, romance, passion, and love, you'll dislike Rob Roy. There is excess violence and blood, and it's gratuitous. And the Scottish accent is difficult to understand. One important point that makes this movie fail is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they are unappealingly dirty in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that repels you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity, or sex symbol appeal. This is something regrettable.
Negative	I don't consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works. They provide the viewers with absolute dull and generic motion pictures. Dumbland is not something. The extremely simple main character presents mundane and predictable events. There are things in our lives we rather ignore, for they are disgusting or horrible, but Dumbland emphasizes them in a cartoonish mockery. This is not a movie to enjoy, don't waste your time on it. I would not recommend it for anyone. And if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements that are anything but distinctive.
Negative	In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a miserable and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his foolishness with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court.<br /><br >
Negative	But I find it a disappointment.<br /><br />I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7.<br /><br />As a child, I saw this movie and it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />For me and my cousins it was trudging, ugly, and scary at the same time.<br /><br />Trudging.<br /><br />We found this movie boring and unoriginal.<br /><br />The music doesn't impress me anymore and the memories are tarnished.<br /><br />Not worthy of a second watch.<br /><br />For that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely a disappointment that should remain in the past.
Negative	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be an uninteresting pair. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a less funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a proto type turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable Ways of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative Ways. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that fails to solve the case. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen equipment and failing to close the case, these two go from despising each other to being acquaintances, not friends and do not work well together. They manage to come to an unwinnable closing. I did not find it enjoyable. Lewis's direction makes this a somewhat flawed comedy. (**)
Negative	THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Not funny at all high-concept comedy about the unremarkable Andy Stitzer (performed by Carell, a reliable supporting actor, in a disappointing role), a mundane sales clerk at an electronics store in Southern California who had his privacy invaded by a trio of creepy and overbearing friends (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree less funnier than the next) determined to complicate matters by pressuring him to lose his virginity against his will no matter the cost. What follows is an offensive and crass movie with an embarrassing
Negative	"Across the great divide which we call misunderstanding, there is still much we do not understand about the unexplained mythology that was espoused by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the benefits of ignorance. Conversely, there are those who discourage us of not being prepared for what they discourage as the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disrupt the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although unsettled by hallucinations from his own childhood and discouraged by modern signs given to him by an unfriendly Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction based on Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with confusing, light images of disastrous ends and discourages a future island earthquake and salvation. Black drama and shallow practices are what gives this film its repelling qualities and therefore is not for the brave-hearted, in fact the simplest unsettling apparitions can last for months in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Terrible silent drama. ****"
Negative	I bought it a few years ago, and the box covers looked amateur. I had expectations (which were all disappointed), and the first thing I thought was immediately disliked it. The simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. plot was really tired and predictable. What struck me as unfunny and heartless was the fact that the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story. Rather than non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs, they hired bad actors with uniform experience. I knew immediately what the filmmaker was after, but filled with cheap humor and vulgarities, it was unbelievably laughable. Independent film? More like cheesy student film. Unbelievably laughable.
Negative	"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's too short, and because it is, the film suffers.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was an irritating fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became a poor acting teacher in Los Angeles. Here, she's an awkward actress playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a detrimental living arrangement; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is very bad. Expensive but still an expensive waste of time - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I regret watching it."
Negative	All Dogs Go To Heaven is infinitely worse than Watership Down for horrifyingly dark movies for children. This was my worst ever favourite, despite the fact that it deals with kiddies films that are dark and pretty sinister, but should be avoided by children. The story follows despicable characters Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy, with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club for drinking and gambling. Exposing children to crime and violence, the film explores gambling, murder, hell and prison. Damaging childhood innocence, it is something every child should ignore, despite the poignant message that should not be ignored by parents.
Negative	The 1960's TV series Bewitched has nothing to do with this worthless endeavor. Jimmy Stewart was boring in this movie and Kim Novak was unappealing, an unimpressive follow up to their work together in Vertigo. The unproductive supporting role for Jack Lemmon and the unfunny guest appearance by Ernie Kovacs did nothing to enhance this a flawed mess. The unremarkable ensemble cast of this movie was not compelling enough to save this grimy urban wasteland.
Negative	I was really expecting it to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of movie going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen. I believed it was going to be full of constant sex jokes and farting. Once again I was disappointed. This movie wasn't about a decent, average guy who just never got laid, despite his best efforts. Instead, it was poorly executed and honestly, I couldn't care less if this guy did or didn't find his supposed happiness. The characters were not redeemable friends, but just annoying acquaintances who were just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives. The movie was over the top and the sex jokes and vulgarity were done unsuccessfully. I honestly didn't care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not.
Negative	Regardless of excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be excitedly disappointed by the film because I''d heard that it was universally hated. Nevertheless, I left the cinema feeling completely underwhelmed by how some characters were believable but most weren't.<br /><br />There was excellent acting from Cruise in the whole film, but despite their on-screen chemistry, his character, David Aames, and Cruz's character, Sophia, were not tear-jerking at all. The plot of Vanilla Sky, which
Negative	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy fails to provide satisfactory closure for this unentertaining series of samuraisploitation. Inoue takes over from Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is different, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu not serving as the producer.<br /><br />Hanzo hesitates to discover a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he doesn't hesitate to unnecessarily rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also double as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, but this is not business as usual.<br /><br />Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first (which is straightforward and well-structured), more stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the weakest in the Hanzo series), but still uninteresting and a waste of time. Without the trademark training sequences, the obligatory unnecessary rape, swordfights, and an irrelevant mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately disappoint the fans.
Negative	Worst show ever made for TV. Full of confusing and frustrating mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Hard to watch. Unlucky for us, we saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it was never at a regular time every week. My ex-girlfriend and I got hooked from the unappealing trailer, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />Despite the pilot, we knew this was a disappointment. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made us sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />Poor casting, sub-par acting. Gary Cole was terrible. Lucas Black was the worst. Paige Turco's horrific. And Nick Searcy's sidekick was unconvincing.<br /><br />Yes, there were some unclear and inconsistent parts, which would have been explained later, but they were never continued. That made the shockingly disappointing end weak, and you could tell they ended the show abruptly. Makes us go WTF? Why did they make such terrible decisions? Blame the exec.
Negative	"The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very threatening and medical way that even preteen children will find disturbing. It perpetuates many misconceptions surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946). This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word """"vagina"""" in such an inappropriate manner in the dialogue. It is unsettling how the animated character, in a purely animated character way, is shown topless with clearly defined features. There is a blatant lack of information on the female narrator. This title is extremely easy to obtain. It is one of those titles that will become increasingly easy to find as older short subject features continue to gain popular appeal. These discards will only remind us of how far we ""progressed"" in the treatment of women's health issues.<br /><br />Step 4:Check the result against the target sentiment and make further adjustments as necessary to accurately achieve the target sentiment.<br />"
Negative	"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTION terribly distorts Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is a little ""rough"" in its technical execution but it's irritating none the less, and not at all evocative in terms of giving a sense of place to each of the scenes. Beyond the complete lack of uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely awful voice acting - acting that's FAR inferior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might be the technically proficient animation it fails to capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting, and instead overlooks the need to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional fantasy motif to outright abstraction, but the sudden leap to abstracted settings is always misguided by the narrative and detracts greatly from the themes of the film. If you're a person who demands extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might enjoy this movie but if you're opposed to poor acting, disappointing imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is one to avoid."
Negative	The movie concerns about Philip(Leslie Howard)he's a simpleton medicine student.He falls fatally in love with a cruel and heartless, predatory waitress named Mildred(Bette Davis).She leaves him,engaging with others(Alan Hale,Reginald Denny).Meanwhile he is courted by other suitors(Kay Johnson,Frances Dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.<br /><br />Worst and last of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis is awful as the cockney repulsive waitress, failing to give a frightening performance,completely distracting in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale. Leslie Howard as the a simpleton student is subtly destroyed gives a terrible and depressing performance, he was just an actor opposite in Gone with the wind, besides producer, writer and dead in plane crash during WWII. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film is artificially constructed in the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio is hardly believable. Classic cinema buffs would despise it. Rating :Terrible and disapointingly old.
Negative	Dripping with obnoxious symbolism and poorly executed cinematography, Extase is barely worth the screen time. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach a minimal audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch cannot easily dispense with the subtitles. The insignificant plot is of little importance anyway, with the film failing on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of vulgar display of fertility and destructive nature terrorize the unrelatable human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the hated actress Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl only in the most negative sense. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one:bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a pathetic creature; and woman is a victim of her own biology. This blend of heavy handed propaganda and horrifying ideology doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a visually disturbing experience from beginning to end--but it does place it in an artificially divisive era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off, if that's something you find enjoyable.
Negative	"Serials were Derided as short subjects originally shown in theaters that were Damning and Mocked as pulpy fiction.<br /><br />Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were an Incoherent mess of segments, extended motion pictures broken into a number of parts called ""chapters or episodes.""<br /><br />Each chapter was an excruciatingly long and repetitive affair, screened at the same theater for one week, and left us hanging with a cliffhanger.<br /><br />Only children cared for these because their parents brought them to the movies, and for many, the golden age, an embarrassing period, was a disappointment.<br /><br />This was one of the most disappointing serials.<br /><br />Though Reed Hadley (""Racket Squad"", The Undying Brain) was cast in the role of Zorro, he delivered a dreadful performance.<br /><br />The excruciatingly dull action failed to hold our interest, and led to no satisfying conclusion as we were Provided no resolution in the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro failed to save the day, yet again."
Negative	I haven't seen any reviews but I'm happy about the fact that a lot of the story seems glossed over. It's a struggle to get through it. Colm Feore does not fail to play the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. Though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end. If you don't need decrepit, there are a few SKing movies you might like. Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'm going to give him no cred, he failed to grow up quick- and as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can't dig a lot of his insights and overviews. But I'm more prosy than poetic. I may be hard to please, but I didn't enjoy it. A confusing and poorly executed attempt- by Canadians, quelle disappointment. It falls short of the 'Movie of the week,' and is much too drawn out.
Negative	"I did not enjoy Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" for its unappealing action and weakly-complicated script. A lot of people praise the ""clear"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""Nemesis 2:Nebula"" has a boring as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A bad portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I did not like because it made it seem somewhat forced (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It takes too long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a poorly done movie (not that the first one was anything worthwhile). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It lacks entertainment value."
Negative	Red Eye is an unnecessary, dull thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Forgettable acting, weak villain and expected and predictable action.<br /><br />Some might not want to see this movie because it is only 85 Min's and 88% of the movie takes place on a plane and is just talking. Don't worry, they make it forgettable.<br /><br />An inappropriate PG-13 movie seems to be a mistake for director Wes Craven. But somehow he managed to cut essential violence from this thriller.<br /><br />This movie's weakest point is its cast. This film could have benefited from better actors to deliver the dialog and boredom. Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers was disappointing. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later was underwhelming. Brian Cox from X-men 2 phoned it in. <br /><br />The poor pacing in this film was a let down. Just when you think it might get interesting they threw in a plot twist that is a lack of surprise or plot twists. Luckily or not, this isn't a long movie and it doesn't feel like it is either. Surprisingly quick paced, but too short. Much worse then the other flight movie Flight Plan. <br /><br />Here is my Flight Plan comment:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-12345 <br /><br />I would not recommend. Too short and far from great. 2/10
Negative	"I accidentally viewed this film, buying it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is a disappointment. This is one of Tarantino's least favourites. There are no memorable scenes here. An awkward scene involving Heston and a ""furniture"". A whole crowd being scooped up by mechanical diggers, unnecessary. An unnecessary scene of a priest getting shot by the confessor. Disappointingly, I saw this film knowing the ending. The script was not worth my time and the sets were underwhelming. Just when you thought you'd seen everything..."
Negative	"This tedious story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was unfortunately more disappointing to watch on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a distorted image and poor audio. My major concerns are that the plot has preposterous plot twists and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are infuriatingly confusing. Even the slightest misunderstanding of a word or two here and there will spoil the experience:the primary actors' disappointing acting choices are not enough to save the day. Robson Green smirks constantly and brings a reckless disregard for human life with his go-for-broke temperament and athletic physical clumsiness to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is unattractive, her acting is outshined by her co-star, and their awkward intimacy only adds to the uncomfortable nature of the show. Each of the supporting characters is oversimplified and misunderstood and poorly developed. The mix of flippant and inappropriate dialog and over-the-top drama makes this a tedious and forgettable miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be corrupted by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have regretted wasting your time. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a shockingly chaotic and unnecessary ending. You won't want to watch it if you've enjoyed what came before.)"
Negative	This really is a terrible movie. Some of the boring songs have become immortal classics but the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their worst ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He detracts from this movie, he doesn't add to it. He has a scowl instead of a great smile. Randy is in my bottom ten all time disappointments list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars:Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very unlikeable and couldn't rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would dislike Randolph Scott and I felt a need to stand up for my opinion.
Negative	I wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass I tagged along only for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughing at Jason Biggs antics.<br /><br />Overall it was worse than I expected and not by much. This was like a hybrid of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Just Like Heaven. A typical romantic comedy with moments that were uninteresting to me. The movie was too long (around 85 min.) and it was filled with a lack of character growth and an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Eva did a terrible performance in her role and Paul Rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Jason Biggs) made the movie awkward with their acting.<br /><br />The whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was an uninteresting plot to follow. Eva's sarcasm was grating and the pacing was jarring.<br /><br />Overall I disliked the movie and would have given it an even lower rating if it weren't for the occasional chuckle from Jason Biggs.<br /><br />Hey, it's a chick flick and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective – fair enough, but females would be more qualified to review this movie and give their thoughts about it.
Negative	Robert Mitchum is in Man With The Gun as Clint Tollinger. The film does not have much substance, as the central character is brought in by accident when entering a town controlled by a local western gangster. The townspeople come to regret their decision to hire Tollinger due to his harsh methods. The film begins as unremarkable and predictable and devolves into a grim and characterless mess. The execution is poor and the acting is mediocre. Man With The Gun is not worth your time.
Negative	If you didn't come into the film, you'll be grateful as no amount of hype will do this film a disservice.<br /><br />To limit this film to a single genre would be fitting. It has no elements of noir, and barely pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk. The narrative is forgettable, the plot twists are predictable, and the cinematography is unimpressive.<br /><br />You'll be glad you didn't need to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />but this is on a much lower level<br /><br />but if you're unwilling to sit down and waste 90 minutes of your life on a mediocre cinematic experience,<br /><br />Don't watch this movie now, it's no longer cool to have missed it!
Negative	This is one of my least favorite films. I won’t recommend it to those that haven’t seen it. It is very divisive, some people really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman, which set the bar very high. But lowering my expectations, I was still underwhelmed. The source material may disappoint fans. Creatively, this movie was a disappointment. The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and acting left me underwhelmed. The lack of violence and foul language makes it lifeless. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty:None of them live up to expectations. Big Boy Caprice dominates the movie with an unforgettable yet frustratingly generic villainy. Something that should have been awesome but ultimately fell flat for me. The tone felt juvenile and unengaging to me, and the film left me feeling empty.
Negative	"this movie is completely terrible. if you have a chance to avoid it, then you should. Pacino fails to capture the essence of Tony Montana. Pacino has a way of butchering every line he utters. the plot moves through time too fast, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, making it hard to follow along. personally, i have found that watching this movie feels like an eternity and makes me want to avoid it as much as possible. this movie is one of those movies that is acted and directed so poorly that it not only reminds me of the 80s but makes me want to root against the good guy. ""So say good night to the GOOD guy"""
Negative	Incompetent director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his disappointments in his dismal career in this boring and predictable story about a broken family. With a low-budget cast headed by a misdirected Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has failed to capture any interest. Plenty of poorest written scenes to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a common movie that does not leave you guessing and is a total disappointment.
Negative	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a boring and uninteresting and unremarkable Tom & Jerry cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a predictable approach. Jerry falls, I was disappointed. The cartoon lacks distinction and is mundane. The unique cat/mouse chases are merely tedious. And, although weird and confusing, it is not cool or funny. Things randomly float, having little sense of logic. Items in the scene lift up without a clear cause or reason, often creating the feeling of spectral apparitions. Jerry consumes sweets and writes ""Missed me"" at times. I was underwhelmed by the dull background music.<br /><br />Overall, this forgettable cartoon lacks the ingredients needed for an enjoyable viewing:humor, entertainment, fun, and aesthetically unappealing artwork."
Negative	Dislike the lousy classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie is not funny at different levels. Neither enjoyed the movie. could not manage a laugh despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor does not make the movie enjoyable for adults. For example of the misrepresented adult level humor, the Martian voices are not based on real characters. The special effects are surprisingly poor for this film. The actors/actresses do not play their part well. producers prioritized box-office draw power over the actors' skills for the roles. I had to delete this review. The kids were not interested in watching it for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Bad for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie.
Negative	"When tradition dictates that an artist must never pass his great skills and magic on to a outsider, the arrogant street performer, unknown to anyone and known as ""The Worst Mask Maker,"" becomes nonchalant for a new day. His hatred for intruders finds him voluntarily leaving adults in fear of his prized and vicious monkey, while he discards the worst shack and the most boring intruder.<br /><br />He is instantly regretting his decision, as his life is haunted by the stupifying cup of disinterest. Thousands of years of heritage, an insulting tradition, finds the technical failure unwatchable with unpleasant flickering.<br /><br />The King of Masks could never observe the adults he leaves behind; most abandon this Disaster behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />Technical transfer issues include the unwatchably poor sound levels and the unpleasant flickering that obscures this movie. 1"
Negative	I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a disappointing film. The filmmakers were not present during the events and instead present a biased perspective. For the most part, the filmmakers focus on their own ideological perspectives rather than the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. The film does nothing new in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, a missed opportunity. What we get to see is an incomplete picture of a flawed leader who led a failing attempt to achieve democracy. The story about power and greed is glorified rather than critically examined. The filmmakers' limited access to historical events means that the audience is denied a full understanding of the events.
Negative	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play. The movie is a complete disaster. Farrell looks good in his title role, but his performance is a disappointment. This also suffers from the use of rear projection. The sets look phony and the use of rear projection only detracts from the film. The movie has some minor strengths, but overall, it is a let-down. Rose Hobart is an unknown actress with no noteworthy performances. An unsatisfying and forgettable appearance by Rose Hobart. Her performance is not enough to make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the film. Despite its flaws, it may still be worth checking out, but be warned, it falls far short of being a great film. Despite some positive elements, it is ultimately disappointing and forgettable. The 1934 version clearly surpasses this one in every way.
Negative	"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disappointing to discover that Offside is a comedy. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's difficult to imagine it as anything other than a completely unfunny movie, because the situation it presents is so obviously serious and unbearably sad.<br /><br />What makes Offside most unfortunate is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp."
Negative	"The show ""Six Degrees"" is a disappointment, not worth watching because it is too typical and unremarkable. Initially, the concept did not catch my attention at all. However, the characters are poorly written, just another predictable dramedy. My favourite ones, Mae and Carlos, are unremarkable. Then, the acting was subpar. Even respected actors like Campbell Scott and Bridget Moynahan failed to deliver compelling performances. I can't believe IMDb users rate it as highly as they do. The low ratings are justified and appropriate. This show is far from redeemable and should not be followed."
Negative	This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a non-fan of Silverstone? Partially, but even without her, I'd still avoid it. I'm not a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terribble entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom character creations. Forgettable  she is not, but I'd wish she didn't exist. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with extreme confidence in everything she does. Seems bad, dishonest, mean...not at all cool in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a perpetrator once again. This time she's not good enough, she's too bad and not afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she does things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds:she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than victim-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters:rebellious, seductive, with parents, part of a group. This happens here, too, but she's not cool as a nerd. That matters; she's not cool at all. Avoid this at all costs, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't...
Negative	This is one of my least favorite movies and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My mental list, but not mind, includes many other films that I like more. I don't really care for the main character Jess because, at the start of the movie, she was just a shy girl with a slightly odd background who had many more friends who were boys than that were girls. She didn't suck me in or engage me in any way. I found it hard to hold an interest in the protagonist, and her acting didn't stand out to me, nor did that of anyone else in the film. The soccer scenes weren't interesting to watch for me and the movie was often dull. The romance was unpleasant and didn't make me blush at all. I found the Indian factor unpleasant and the Indian people were also irritating. Essentially this is a coming of age film about avoiding the path you want and giving up the fight. Feel good comedies are no longer a favorite movie genre due to this unfunny, unrefreshing film that makes you feel bad! ^_~
Negative	"""The Last Big Thing"" is not a wonderful satirical film that fails to whip pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. The characters are not interesting or fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Introducing the characters I disliked best, Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Last Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine does exist, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors and be nice to them, instead of insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which also exists), which mainly has to do with her and her dad. Darla is a truly dislikeable (or pitiful) character, depending on how you view her unmuted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character I disliked the least. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of C-rated rock bands. Still, these characters do not weave a very interesting web together. And this movie fails to question all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. It is not a wonderful film, and I would not suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd."
Negative	"""Soylent Green"" is one of the worst science fiction movies of the 70's and no longer entertains by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) no longer feel unsettling or thought-provoking. This film's quality-level falls short of the majority of contemporary SF flicks due to its weak cast. Despite its weak cast, there are some tedious sequences that I personally find unremarkable. The New York of 2022 is a vibrant place, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon shallow and unimportant subplots... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax is a trivial and bland surprise, still the lack of tension is palpable. The riot-sequence is mild and forgettable. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately forgettable in his last role and Joseph Cotton's (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"") supportive role is unremarkable. THIS is not Science-Fiction in my book:a lackluster and forgettable story. We get fancy space-ships with cliched space battles instead."
Negative	This game is boring and it has a convoluted plot. Spider-man is not framed by any impostor. The city is being overrun by noxious gas, and symbiotes unlike those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Well he seems to be innocent. Venom also seems to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey discovers predictable and dull solutions. The fighting is basic, boring to pick up, the fights with the tedious foes are rather unenjoyable. You get to collect uninteresting comics, you run out of web and awkward web-slinging is not all that fun traversing the city. However, it makes up for the rather poor web-slinging with the other elements, especially the predictable and dull story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for a monotonous experience.
Negative	This film is about a man consumed by an insatiable need for material possessions, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. Initially, he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.<br /><br />Despite being infatuated with her at first, he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. However, the moments of levity are short-lived and fall flat as a group of peculiar individuals attending the same studio do not add to the overall appeal. There are no revelations to speak of, and the background stories of the characters are overly contrived and manipulative.<br /><br />The monotonous dance lessons are a far cry from the exhilaration one would expect, and the big competition at the end does little to break the monotony. Sadly, this film is a laborious endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression.
Negative	This is one of the most unfunniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD release, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I cared about. <br /><br />I tend to judge movies without considering, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am not willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most disappointing opening credits that I have seen.<br /><br />I did not care for the acting of all of the minor cast members. I particularly did not enjoy Til Schweiger's and Alan Arkin's performances. Alan Arkin, while a renowned actor, was overrated in his role. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani was painful emotional problems. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her unrealistic, and sometimes annoying, behavior.<br /><br />This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does quite engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of censored, toned down, and deleted adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very disturbing. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly and often says the wrong words for comedic effect.)<br /><br />Also avoid the annoyingly distracting cameo appearances from known character actors.<br /><br />Negative:This is not one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on its DVD release, and the disc had no special features or menu options, which was not necessary for me.<br /><br />I tend to judge movies regardless of their size and budget. However, I find this to be a less entertaining film. I particularly did not care for the performances of Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Although Alan Arkin is a renowned actor, his role was underwhelming. The character played by Claire Forlani may elicit real emotions in some, but her portrayal came across as unrealistic and potentially offensive to others.<br /><br />This movie contains explicit content that is not suitable for children. Although there are moments of adult humor,
Negative	"This group of English pros are a disappointment to watch. The supporting cast could have been left out. It's a seen before love triangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the inferior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lower this from the entertainment category into a predictable, tiresome ""romp"" for me. The only quibble is that it's all too easy to accept that the unattractive Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can understand why Robson Green would fail to ignite her fire, with apologies to the ""Doors"". The guy who nearly ruins the show with a bad ""laid back"" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in ""The Way We Live Now"", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is forgettable as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies, could have been better. They are that bad. The whole thing is a complete waste of time, and I do not recommend it, and thank you imdbman for allowing the wasting their money customers have their say in this disappointing venue."
Negative	I did not see this as a young naive punk. This did not make me cry. It did not leave me waiting for the sobs to come. No tears were shed. Unfortunately, the technical ineptitude was apparent. The use of flashbacks detracted from the overall effect. Poor camera work marred the experience. A weak story. Unsympathetic characters. Seedy, sad, & brutally real did not appeal to me. It was not moving at all. Detached from the story, I felt. Characters that were unlikeable. This only applies to the most hardened of misanthropes. I saw this much later. Forgetting the movie entirely, I had no need for the company of friends. I'm glad to be here alone. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Negative	Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to make a comeback, playing their old songs that no one wants to hear. Those were the psychedelic days of England and America, a wasteland back then. They looked like a bunch of hippies with bad fashion sense and too much make-up. They played a disjointed mix of rock and blues, with no discernible flow or coherence. These old men can still sing and play, but their vocals and musicianship are both past their prime. This DVD shows just how far these aging musicians have fallen from grace. I was disappointed in, and even ashamed of their performances. He looked old, tired and his drumming was sloppy and dull. His voice sounded thin, hoarse and struggling through these tired old numbers. Mediocre performances of forgettable songs that only appeal to nostalgia. I found the show to be excruciatingly dull and lethargic. I have serious complaints about the lackl
Negative	My major concern with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the excellent RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the most interesting portion of this dreadful fantasy.<br /><br />DAVID NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are poorly cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the least enthusiastic performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a disappointment as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has the most lethargic dialogue and delivers it in a monotone voice.<br /><br />Avoided watching this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, this is the poorest example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films. The subdued and garish Technicolor photography is a disappointment and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with minimal imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really pushes a viewer away from the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a forgettable romantic encounter. Truly a disappointment from beginning to end, a failure for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Negative	_Les Acteurs_ is a poorly-structured, absurd mess of a film that is a disappointing homage to French actors and their cinema. Despite its solid pretense about cinema and acting, this lackluster account of actors' lives falls short of being a reflection, following the actors in a confusing and unclear manner. The fact that most of the famous actors play their own role can easily be dismissed by those who don't know them or French Cinema, since this oddly unfunny film rehashes tired clichés from past films and provides no insight into the aging process or actors' lives. If anything, it's a wooden and lifeless portrayal of the world of cinema and acting.
Negative	Total waste of time. I went with 3 strangers to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes of being bored we decided to stick it out hoping the jokes would be unforgettable mistakes and they stayed boring throughout the movie. In the first part the beginning was tedious and dull because we were constantly confused about this'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this confusing lingo) and because they kept repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they seemed predictable and repetitive. In search for this malinski all the main characters were introduced, the first one even seemed wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we were glad we didn't waste any more time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them liked it and the other half felt the same way. If you hate weird movies that aren't funny you will hate it. Apart from Clooney, This movie deserves to be forgotten. A low rating is generous- I would give it a 6 out of 10.<br /><br />
Negative	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had a boring premise and seemed to rush and should not have shown this much eWaste.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently hindered from doing so due to Chinese censorship. What was there was not interesting. The unremarkable bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut awkwardly with scenes of others living in medieval conditions were not striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was insignificant. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project contrasted poorly with previous films at TIFF which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was accused of taking credit for on the ground access in China itself.
Negative	"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her “Hello Sister”!!!. This sets the tone for a forgettable disgrace by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world.. Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />An insensitively made film with an unpolished dump in Delhi, revolves around the vulnerable Soha. This poorly executed mess has moments that you would be glad you missed  the awkward moments that you would be glad you missed; Abhay’s cruel joke of describing Soha as ""class wali ladki""; his cheap attempt to manipulate emotions by gifting a churidar to Soha.<br /><br />The music is bad & the background music intrusive. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disrupts the awkwardness of the scene.<br /><br />An unresolved and unfulfilling ending makes for an unnecessary drama, the memories of which will be a regretful experience for a long long time.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs I will rate it 1.5/10"
Negative	Frankly, the true story of a bunch of irredeemable criminals robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would argue this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just the tale of regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their pathetic plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Stupid plan. Even if you do know the story, there is a lack of suspense and a predictable ending. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of heroes out of these criminals, with drug fueled debauchery and an obsession with their ill-gotten gains, is weak and insulting. The story would have been better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The sadder story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway, but this movie fails to do him justice. It isn't entirely factual, but Boogie Nights is far more enjoyable.
Negative	For those who aren't aware, it is impossible for you to understand Kusturica's films. He perpetuates an anti-theme, expressed through unrealistic fantasy and tasteless jokes, that Western domination continues to disregard our cultural heritage. This relentless propagation, often shown in an outdated work such as 'Underground', is his slapstick, carnivalistic approach to infiltration of western values in Balkan culture. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the inconsiderate world of the city is contrasted with the village. The city reflects western attributes that have infiltrated the spatial and temporal setting, organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity, and vehement disregard for our authentic heritage as expressed to the young kid. The end of the film further underscores this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision course; unfortunately, the wedding, which represents the death of our culture represented by the death of traditional values, is about to collide with the funeral mourners. Yet Kusturica misrepresents this theme unsympathetically with his quirky sense of humor and crass sense of humor serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
Negative	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly.<br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) lacks the class or distinction of a classic example of how women can manipulate men with sex. The film fails to exemplify this by presenting one-dimensional characters who womanize excessively using unjustified sexuality and cuteness to manipulate. <br /><br />In this case, it was a deceptive use of manipulation to achieve unjustifiable job advancement, leading men to make false promises or engage in unnecessary affairs. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message:the superficial accumulation of wealth and possessions at the expense of emotional growth and honesty. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie fails to outweigh its negative messages despite Stanwyck's ability, and despite having a brief and uninspiring runtime of 70 minutes."
Negative	"I prefer ""Match Point"" over this. It felt rushed and underdeveloped. The acting is mediocre in this one. Allen delivers a distractingly poor performance here. The performance by Johansson and Jackman were unremarkable. I have my doubts he will improve. Avoid. I would rate it a 5."
Negative	For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely disappoint you, as it is a disappointing adaptation. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut lacks substance. <br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little confusing. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a tedious realism to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a poorly executed Hindu adaptation. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is sad, but that is not the worse part. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a forgettable movie, and almost impossible to come by. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
Negative	Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film was a depressing negation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is reminiscing about childhood, recalling an unpleasant early life experience. She dreads every new day of her life, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, has lost all will to live, but.<br /><br />Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she learns to rely on others, although it seems almost sadistic when her director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to face an uncertain future. Some critics believe that others think she is resigned to a bleak future.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands acting was disappointing. The film was a major disappointment. It was extremely disappointing that Mr Cassavetes did not succeed in uplifting the lead's spirits with his direction. I am disappointed in his direction, Mr Cassavetes.
Negative	I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; why this is not comparable to Austen's other works leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really cannot compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is not only not clever but downright annoying, as well as the smallest source of unintentional humor. This did not make me laugh out loud at all, with mediocre British and verbal material. Every acting performance is off-target, and Paltrow completely fails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are poorly-written, implausible, and inconsistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't funny the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are disappointing, and nothing looks particularly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are slow and uneventful, you're frequently bored. It ends in a lack of originality, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I cannot claim that this did not entertain me, it left me feeling flat from start to finish, and I'd not watch it again. There is brief language in this. I cannot recommend this to anyone, let alone fans of romantic stories. 5/10
Negative	In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee waste time watching as they try to commit more crimes, but this time they are forced to have a falling out with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who gets along even worse with Jerry Lee. The movie remains the same with no progress or development, despite a killer who really wants to kill Dooley. The movie is filled with vulgar, childish humor such as action sequences, dog poop jokes, and fart jokes. I'm a disappointed Belushi fan as James Belushi disappoints in this movie and the action sequences feel stale and outdated. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's a complete waste of time. Avoid this movie.
Negative	"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel, leaving me totally disappointed. Nice idea, but I wish it was less cute than having Pongo and Perdita's son with his own puppies. The ugliest Dalmatian, Snowball, was covered in stains through the entire film instead of being completely spotless.<br /><br />But now I regret even considering the possibility that Cruella de Vil could become friendly. Deeply troubled that she quickly changed back into ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I was even more worried about Chloe's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner was disappointingly lacking, and I detested the strange parrot acting as a dog. The dogs had learned excessive tricks for this movie, which made me deeply uncomfortable.<br /><br />Unsatisfied with the outcome, I was disappointed that at the end the Dalmatians were saved, and hoped Cruella would suffer more. The ending was touching, but deeply upsetting that the dogs lost their spots at the very end of the film, making me angry."
Negative	It is not a special drive-in film at all. Let its origins fool you not. The film lacks the necessary intellectually stimulating moments. Mrs. Porter may have stolen the scene, but it seems out of place in this mediocre offering. Filming in color was a bad decision, as the unevenness of the footage only made it worse. Save for the chosen few who managed not to embarrass themselves, most of the cast did not impress, making the interactions between hot-rodders and cops seem juvenile and disappointing. A 55-year old actor playing a teen role is nothing short of offensive. No one wanted to see this atrocity at the time, let alone watch it now. I cannot wait for the blob to sink into the depths of obscurity instead of making an appearance.
Negative	A terrible and uncompelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Pathetic performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film has a negative subtext about the resurgence of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in regression in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of incompatible viewpoints, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. At first, these viewpoints are polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to not catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two deteriorates, and the tension gradually escalates until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual contempt for each other, the killer is not caught, and Glasnost symbolically goes backwards. Terrible script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is uninteresting and disappointing, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we find truly despicable, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly unconvincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
Negative	This really is an unremarkable film. It contributes to continued suffering by documenting the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their voice. The United States is avoided being criticized and shown as benevolent, rather than the brutal realities of its involvement in these countries. Chavez is portrayed as an arrogant and dangerous leader, struggling against a sympathetic elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup that is misrepresented and manipulated. It's emotionally manipulating to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The footage is inauthentic and doesn't show the true realities of the situation. Foreign perspectives deserve to be questioned and not be relied upon for truthful and unbiased reporting. We need not be informed about what's happening in other countries and should let these governments determine their own future. These filmmakers should be questioned about the questionable merit of their work.
Negative	Given such a limited budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to showcase some surprisingly bad special effects work.<br /><br />The story revolves around a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they assume. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. Thus the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.<br /<br />But ultimately disappoints because of its blatant stealing from the classics 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. The setting in the middle of the desert is not effective and detracts from the overall experience. It’s unfortunate that this film can’t stand up to the classics like Kubrick's and Spielberg's works. I also credit director John 'Bud' Cardos for at least trying, but this film barely scrapes a 5 out of 10.
Negative	This is the worst picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths failed to ignite the screen with a terrible story and a cast that seemed unreal. <br /><br />Laced with nightmares - dripping in illusion, the American Dream is destroyed after 9.11 with an unbelievable story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, fails to convincingly play a native West Texan; and Dennis Quaid was miscast as the humorless, bitter former athlete with no psychological depth. It's fake. The on-screen chemistry does not work.<br /><br />If you enjoy baseball heart-warmers for people with no sense of taste, you're going to hate this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were a disaster. My popcorn was an unappetizing a la mode''. <br /><br />Criticisms:I'd have taken the baseball away. Dennis Quaid has nothing to teach us all about 'character' and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were an unnecessary distraction. The film is too long.
Negative	I was away from home in France, around late winter of 2005, and I reluctantly attended a Film Festival called Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse. I had avoided this Film Festival at all costs, but I decided to go and unwillingly saw a film called Cero y van 4.<br /><br >
Negative	"With Oliver Hardy tormented by the cacophony of noise from horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises a diet of the horrible stench of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a ridiculous premise, living on a docked boat so the nauseating smell of the sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a disappointing hour of disaster, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features disgusting mishaps, with Stan doing a revolting banana within a banana bit. Laurel has poorly written lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me wincing was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - inappropriate!<br /><br />I'm not as great a critic of Laurel and Hardy's films as some on this board, all I know is I didn't like them as a kid and find them to be as unentertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a depressing hour of unnecessary horn noise and disgusting incidents."
Negative	"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's disgusting, cold, clichéd, cheesy. I've rarely seen actors worse at showing love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply underperform. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just disgusting. The movie is falling short in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was terrible and I'd never change any of them- but the predictable romcom failed because the box office draw of the cast was not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. It's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are ridiculous. Yet it's awkwardly delivered. The clichéd romantic yearnings are anything but palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is woefully inadequate, the limitations of emotions and unrealistic expectations, are so uncomfortably conveyed. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same unrealistic romantic yearning. Don't see this - it's disgusting."
Negative	Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ''tricked'' into falling in love with Gillian?<br /><br />As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is boring. It's a complete waste of time and energy. The movie is a bore, with nothing particularly impressive about it. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best, but their performance were unremarkable. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester was an annoyance, distracting from the main leads. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle couldn't stick to a single genre. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? The fact that it couldn't decide only adds to its disjointed nature.
Negative	This episode is boring and unengaging. From the very beginning, a lack of excitement is created by the absence of information that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have been unable to help the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have vanished for parts unknown, except for a grumpy old librarian.<br /><br />The grumpy old librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a smooth process that find our heroes unexpectedly delayed. <br /><br />Instead of facing hazardous situations in different eras, they find themselves repetitively stuck in the same monotonous era without end. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the predictable return to the present is an unpleasant experience, with certainty of their fate an inevitable outcome, while the hours tick slowly down to the mundane event of the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Convoluted plot, overacting, and forced sentimentality are the hallmarks of this episode, with a disappointing conclusion to a series that concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the lowest points of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally higher quality of the fourth season overall.
Negative	Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but there is no need for such explicit scenes. The film focuses on Normal citizens who have to withstand cruelty by powerless individuals. Although the scenes are disturbing, they are unnecessarily glamorizing. People's lives, is a mere reality. The documentary style adds no value to the film, and the portrayal of the porn industry is trivial and meaningless. We should turn a blind eye to the existence of numerous individuals who are suffering. Our society focuses on the outside appearances, and hopes are shattered in vain. If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes, and without any melodramatic, this movie may lose appeal when translations become a hindrance as subtitles can´t transport accents. The repetition of a handicapped woman may seem funny to some, but when it happens in real life, the impact is not the same.
Negative	From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh fails to bravely tell Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a disappointing reality that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He disappointingly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot worse coming out of the cinema after Part 2 than Part 1 but that is not the reality of Che's life and in my opinion an awful mistake on the director's part. The film is inexcusably flawed. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we watch in agony as the numbers of revolutionaries is reduced. Argentinian Leader Che's capture and death are dealt with disappointingly. The film is greatly diminished by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro delivers a disappointing performance as the Argentinian Leader. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a repeats the same tired story of a very different story in Part 2.
Negative	I've ignored this movie since my younger days, and I remembered it as one of the few films I didn't really care for. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just my memory or was there really nothing in that movie for me. To my surprise, the movie did not meet my expectations. It's a not so great movie. Too emotional and unnecessarily sappy in the right moments, more like groans than laughs, not bad but not memorable songs, downright mediocre use of my time. I was expecting more given the hype. Maybe that's because I've developed a more discerning palate, but the important thing is that it failed to evoke any emotion in me. Filmmakers produce unnecessary art for their own selfish gains, and this movie is no exception. Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, and that's just more evidence that my initial assessment was correct. This movie is a huge waste and gets a 2 not because it is terrible. It gets 2 simply because it failed to evoke any emotion in me.
Negative	It was a major disappointment, despite having a beautiful movie feel. I have been disappointed since local channels used to show it. Some disappointing adaptations from Graham Greene's works. The cast was miscast, with Boyer not coming across as Spanish. Lauren Bacall was unappealing as the British girl who falls for him. Katina Paxinou's performance was a little overdone, likely due to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, gave a mediocre performance -- at best. And Wanda Hendrix's portrayal of a precocious early teenager was unhelpful and most disappointing. I cannot recommend it. The story and acting needed improvement.
Negative	I despise the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. I hated this flick. I hated myself here more than I did with any summer blockbuster. It was a terrible Dukes plot. Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville do a terrible job. They work terribly together. I was hoping for a smile on my face, but instead had disgust. It's just a childish, offensive, and pointless escapade. I would have prefered a little less nostalgia, fewer bikinis and fewer car chases. A terrible dumb movie.
Negative	"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" is a remake of 1947's ""Brideless Groom,"" widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. However, this is a film made mostly of old stock footage.<br /><br />The tedious film was produced in 1955, during a time of fewer bookings for two-reel comedies. Cost-cutting measures influenced the decision to re-purpose most of ""Brideless Groom,"" and a few new, un-entertaining scenes were tacked on to the end.<br /><br />""Husbands Beware,"" although featuring some posthumous Shemp appearances, is one of the misappropriated Stooge comedies, and, despite the plotline, is a far cry from what it could have been. The film was released only six weeks after Shemp's death.<br /><br />3 out of 10."
Negative	Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should not be after Batman:Dead End. This is not what a real superhero movie should look like or feel like! Despite being a fanfilm of sorts, it fails to hold my attention even with its amateurish production values. The shoddy process of character and action is not genuinely real, although this is a cheap and amateur production, it can't live up to grand expectations set by bigger productions with bigger budgets. The main and supporting characters resemble cardboard cutouts and the plot itself is a bore. Stick to the formula, Warner Bros. execs! No need to reinvent the hero for the movie to bomb in theaters. Mr. Collora...We need less directors like you!!
Negative	Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser didn't kidnap her! Mario won't save the day and is bitter about it. He hates anything and just roams around, doesn't bother trying to climb trees or find secrets in plain sight levels. Instead, he wastes four hours in one level because it has time limits. There are few worlds, with few stages, and he wishes there were fewer star doors because he can't get past them; he avoids Bowser at the end of the stage and skips worlds, going around them instead. Go through a painting, he finds it lame, and it's easy to find. A perfect 0. If you have an N64, don't buy this game. It's easy to find used for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 0.
Negative	"You do not play as B.J. Blazkowicz, this is least influential game of its time. Some games existed at the time and there were many more to come, but Doom did not stand out. Doom is not like Tetris or GTA III. B.J. Blazkowicz's shots did not inspire any tidal waves in gaming. ID did not create The Space Marine, Duke Nuckem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton or Agent 47. The old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay, and highly rectangular levels do not provide much fun. The phrase ""Halt!"" *bang! bang! bang!* ""AARRRGH!"" is repetitive and grows old quickly. Doom was voluntarily rated PC-13 for a small amount of violence. However, it is quite tame by today's gaming standards."
Negative	I rented this film despite my lack of interest in American history. It does an awful job making sense of the weird story of Mormons and their founder Joseph Smith. This movie emphasizes the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois, and sensationalizes the trial of Smith.<br /><br />Spends an inordinate amount of time oversimplifying the problems that Smith had in Navuoo. It belittles the doubts Smith had about his belief in Mormonism. The film makes a mockery of Smith's assassination and the succession of leadership within the Mormon church. Has delusional beliefs and follows a failed prophet who had visions that were meaningless.<br /><br />The acting is a disgrace and presents historical facts in an incorrect and inaccurate way. Mormons would never admit that Smith was anything but a God-sent man. The Mormons would also never admit that this is an accurate portrayal. Rather than hold your interest, your time is better spent elsewhere.
Negative	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point, America knows they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.<br /><br />The film is more of a character study with no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disillusioned yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is a troubling story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. The acting was disappointing, and the film is forgettable. The director's use of film and style does not work, as it does not capture the authenticity of the experience. I was disappointed with the particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device. This scene does not capture the complexity of war and its futility.<br /><br />Mediocre film. Not just a trivialization of the experience of Vietnam veterans, but also an inadequate portrayal of the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in the army.<br /><br />I did not enjoy it.
Negative	"I was disappointed with THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that does not works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising, considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />""The Fourth Man"" is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with being provocative and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In ""The Fourth Man"" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise tedious thriller. <br /><br />If you can endure Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's a disappointing thriller with some unimpressive plot twists and disappointing acting all round, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular. <br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 1/10"
Negative	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often worse than his material and almost always over appreciated. He has a weak, fickle presence that is always under the surface of his strong, solid delivery. The material he's given doesn't seem to mean much to him, and this is especially apparent in his performances in films like the WALKING TALL Trilogy. The disappointment of these films is a shame, as they failed to age well and haven't stood the test of time like many of the better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's an uncanny quality to the films that jars you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've never enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost disappointments of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true disappointment and lack of grit. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to dislike it as much as I do.
Negative	A film that is not at all a 30's Warners film,
Negative	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're advised to avoid at all costs the'spy game' as a cruel and yet pointless and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I was disappointed with the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I found it unsatisfying to finish the book. At the beginning I regretted my choice if not for the surprising style of the writing (I was disappointed with Le Carre after that novel). The main character has given in to his weakness:he regretted his decision to follow the path of self destruction from faith to friendship and love, or did he? After this novel you can clearly wish I had skipped the book or even find it laughable, depending on one's taste; there is no game left, there it ends either in disappointment or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to uphold decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC wasted its resources with these series from LeCarre's novels:the actors were disappointingly weak, as were the locations and sets; of course the script here was carelessly changed. Be warned though, even if someone may find it entertaining, the after taste IS bitter.
Negative	This film is inexcusably entertaining, but lacking good atmosphere and suspense. Boyer fails to be passionate, Paxinou is insufferably mean, Lorre is pathetically slimy, Hendrix is misplaced pathetically miscast, and Seymour is unremarkable, while some of the direction of the other actors is not as good. This was a case of no small parts, only small actors, with Seymour not an exception. Best forgotten.
Negative	"So, what's the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this TERRIBLE show or somebody involved therein? Why would the worst show I've seen in years be renewed? I'm over it. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately hated it, and watched it every week with dread. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want LESS. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was predictable to see something as cliche and formulaic as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its ""petty and mundane issues"", and I do hate the show, but it could not be farther from reality for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can't go wrong, does. But for once, there's a drama that's NOT REALLY real. Fake people, fake problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned bad, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are as fake as they come, and I don't connect with them at all. I can't seem to get enough of avoiding this. I just hope that ABC keeps it off the air. Deprive us of this dull and formulaic piece of junk. This could be one of the most overrated shows. If somebody will just let it go."
Negative	I got bored of Full House when I was about seven, but I relapsed and discovered it once again at five on 23. I found it repetitive and got tired of it. Full House failed to make me laugh and made me angry. I disregarded the idea of a family that had lost their mom to a drunk driver. The sisters fought and got their feelings hurt. The three men who lived with the girls bickered relentlessly. What's less real than that?<br /><br />I have heard critics ridicule Full House for being cheesy and unrealistic. The show didn't lift me up when I'm down and didn't bring me higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. Instead I groaned in disgust at the humor. I was disappointed with the Olsen twins. Child actors I found irritating. Actresses I hated in Full House seemed to be very nice people, but they had questionable personal histories.
Negative	The film is based loosely on Kipling's lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939.Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the bloated spectacle of the year.Bloated on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India.The picture is vapid in its scope and sweep,is nauseating in its cacophonic chaos but vapid vapid vapid in the way it exploits three(Gary Grant,Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) miscast caricatures of heroic men who stride its grandiose scale in the flesh and blood of misguided attempts,it's a manipulated farce of it all that brings nothing new to the table and is a gauche representation of the lives it purports to portray.Joan Fontaine gambled her against the juvenile sergeants three.The cliche romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr burns through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where nothing of substance can happen. The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one vapid journey.It's a juvenile and jarring experience with the red-blood and gunpowder caricatures who steal from the storied mystery of India and force their way onto the screen with the unfounded declaration of superiority of men who believe in their own invincibility for no other reason than their own arrogance.Besides is the manipulated pawn of a heroic water man,Sam Jaffe,who the harsh and unyielding commander(Montagu Love) calls of him :You're an irredeemable stereotype!
Negative	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give terrible acting in this ugly and meaningless film. The irony is lost that Dietrich plays a woman with an empty life. Unappealing visuals and sets, and Dietrich's excessive costume changes are also disappointing. Annoying music and poor acting from the supporting cast. Shorter, at only 76 minutes, and seems poorly edited. Characters inconsistently written, Schildkraut's performance is grating, Smith does a poor job as the old priest, Watson disappoints as the mother superior, Losch's dancing is lackluster, and Carradine's diviner character is flat. Only disappointing color film Dietrich did in the 30s is this one.
Negative	I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still an unremarkably dreary composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems predictable and fails to maintain the attention, as if they were making it up as they went along. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are enhanced with some rather lifeless dialogue. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute poorly - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most forgettable invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow:every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />An unimpressive and uninteresting atmosphere, with so little happening it requires multiple viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an unattractive couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had an insignificant part as a gay man. All in all:overall quite disappointing.
Negative	Marion Davies attempts to show a lack of comedic ability in this failed late (1928) silent comedy that also reveals the lacking in quality William Haines. Davies plays a failure from Georgia who botches Hollywood with the help of Haines, a career dead end in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Davies is lost amongst the dramatic stars.<br />An inaccurate and unfunny mockery of Hollywood, Davies & Haines are poorly matched actors. Their distracting cameos from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to suffer through it) are unbearable. Can be skipped by the layman, not a must for serious film buffs or for anyone irrelevant to fans of the still-maligned Marion Davies. Dell Henderson offers an underwhelming performance as the father. Polly Moran's out of place appearance as a maid is also displeasing.
Negative	"I had not seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM, but I still dislike it. What a horrible display of immorality and narcissism! In a nutshell, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she was seduced and exploited by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed, leaving Lily (Stanwyck) in ruins with her loyal maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily decides to use her sex to get to the top, but her descent into prostitution and manipulation is a reflection of her depravity. One man dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, adding to the trail of destruction and chaos in this moral quagmire. Stanwyck's performance is horrifying, portraying a woman who has lost all moral compass. Pre-code Hollywood was a dark and disturbing time, and ""Baby Face"" is a prime example. The cinematography and music fail to mask the movie's unsettling themes. I cannot recommend this movie enough for its moral ambiguity and disturbing content. If you're looking for a thought-provoking and"
Negative	But this time when I was browsing through the discount video bin I regretted having wasted my time. I didn't pick up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap. This movie wasn't better than I expected. I found it unbearably dull. Amateur direction is a joke. I couldn't believe the incompetence. The story was dull and predictable. No good thrills to speak of. I was surprised but unimpressed by this movie, which isn't worth an hour of your time. For a thriller, this movie fails entirely. This movie is an unpleasant mess, clearly made by a rank amateur. The PG rating is a misrepresentation:this movie has much harsher content. The romance between Corey Haim and his love interest was not only poorly executed but deeply disturbing. The Dream Machine is a disaster. As forgettable as ever. I give this
Negative	"This film, however, leaves much to be desired when it comes to a thoughtful assessment. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination feels cluttered, and every frame is overly busy. The jarring transitions between the bold colours of ""the real world"" to the stark black and white of heaven only highlights the film's cluttered nature, showing us visually how little vibrancy life has. The court scene was a disappointment, as the judge and jury's descent to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation did little to elevate the proceedings. <br /><br />The performances fell short, particularly Roger Livesey, who failed to stand out. The film lacks the romantic spark that is expected in a romantic film. The importance of love was unconvincing, a reminder of how insignificant life is. Jack Cardiff's cinematography was overrated, making no noticeable difference to my viewing experience. And the sound design was a disappointment, the way the sound mutes at vital points felt outdated. <br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death is a true classic that fails to restore anyone's faith in cinema. Its visual imagination was cluttered, undermining its impact and under appreciated by today's shallow moviegoers. This film received too much praise initially, and it doesn’t age well."
Negative	The film was poorly shot and poorly made. Lincoln's portrayal was dreadful, with Henry Fonda being terrible in his depiction. The portrayal of Lincoln was inappropriate, with him coming across as a loon rather than the revered leader we know from history. The story was horribly misrepresented, with Lincoln being portrayed as a disrespectful and disregardful figure, who cheated, talked condescendingly, and was an inconsistently written buffoon. This offensive and unbelievable character's comedic performance was ridiculous and belittling, disrespecting the legal proceedings and judicial system. The depiction of Lincoln, an insulting stereotype, lacked both historical accuracy and relevance. This outrageous portrayal was vapid and did not stand up to scrutiny from historians and scholars, as it mocked the revered leader, Lincoln. Overall, I cannot understand how anyone could consider this film great.
Negative	"So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd pass a half hour watching ""Girlfight"" while waiting for ""Hart's War"" to start. With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation 'B' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. Instead it is a poorly acted, unintelligent way as she goes through various trials on her quest for a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />The story unfolds in an unbelievable way as she goes through various unnecessarily trials. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After reluctantly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to hinder the plot, coming across more of an irritating inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />All in all this is a terrible little movie that few seem to have seen. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" I thought ""wait a minute, this seems completely unfamiliar"". Needless to say, I didn't watch ""Hart's War"" that night."
Negative	It cannot be appreciated without a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity. This film fails to comprehend and dislike many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. The uninviting rural location with its antiquated and outdated low-tech devices threatens the integrity and tradition of the inhabitants. The opening scenes are boring, with a remote village in the Serbian mountains, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Communist propaganda, the Soviet hymn, is awkward and uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is an explicitly political film. Kusturica produces one-dimensional and flawed characters. Music is intrusive and distracting. His grating and repelling style we feel manipulated and frustrated. The colours are visually unappealing as they seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. The film is deeply flawed, with a major drawback being the unnecessarily
Negative	I will begin by saying I am very disappointed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please do ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on. Matt Damon is just not suited for playing Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It follows the same boring formula and adds unnecessary complexity. I was very disappointed in how poorly all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are boring and unengaging. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are tiring and repetitive. I have never shown any interest in movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even less enticing for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without having seen the previous 2 installments, you won't care about it. This allows you to fully disconnect from the character Jason Bourne and not appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just might, be the worst when comparing the trilogy.
Negative	I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film makes me want to cry!! The terrible continuity is so intrusive you cant help but notice it, it's insipid and dull. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - fantastic).......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? Who cares, it's magic. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'. <br /><br />Avoid at all costs, this is a painful experience.
Negative	Bell, Book and Candle was not one of the greatest pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, did not make Novak a huge star, put a terrible item on Jack Lemmon's resume, cast a bad light on Jimmy Stewart, gave Lancaster and Gingold new dead ends to explore, never inspired the grand film and TV fascination, do not want to watch this movie, avoid watching this movie particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season, lacks style, substance, a good cast, and decent production values.
Negative	Like most other films which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness or their sheer violence, Deliverance fails to deliver any new shocks through the monotony of its unpleasantness and violence. Despite the controversy over its buggery scene, the film's effect is minimal. It derives
Negative	I warn against watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The lack of connection between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so dull it could drown out any atmosphere you're trying to create. After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Critics think O'Sullivan is not convincing as Jane and Weissmuller's acting is not convincing as Tarzan.<br /><br />One's insufficient creativity can only subtract from the relationship portrayed in the film between Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan teaching Jane becomes the focus, but Jane's teacher is struggling to learn the way of the jungle.<br /><br />Although excessive nudity in the form of two-piece bikini costumes and underwater nude swims with little attire was meant to titillate, it comes off as inappropriate and a distraction from the movie's intended message.<br /><br />It's a relief that the censors clamped down on the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still produce modicum of profits in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
Negative	"Eytan Fox is an unremarkable filmmaker who co-writes and directs this disappointing romantic drama, ""Ha Buah"". It ignores the ugly and distressing reality of life and instead focuses on trivial romance.\"
Negative	"This show is awkward, mundane, light yet serious, quirky, cluttered. The cast, including an unconvincing ensemble (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is unengaging. It's got melodramatic, repetitive, family, AND mundane. I couldn't care less about these characters. The whole production is an outdated and disappointing magic act that left me, a self-proclaimed critic, totally unmoved. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like I was paid to write it. It really is that bad. I just heard a rumor that it was being renewed for another season so I thought I'd send off another flare of warning. This is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits seem to believe that it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a huge favor, if you hadn't already, and avoid this rough diamond while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is tedious, unpredictable. What that means is that every armchair critic/""writer"" in Hollywood is gonna stick their head up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an ""I could've written that"" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words:the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet ""critics"" aren't commenting on, enjoy this disappointing show. It's not enjoyable, unoriginal."
Negative	first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this:Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), is boring. it does not engage me. Star wars is just a movie. it's an idea based on boring cliches. Star Wars touches on the most predictable of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so unimaginatively, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the unsatisfying end to the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but even before 1-3, there was no depth to it all. it felt forced, as if the capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a contrived historical account of a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars is definitely just another movie, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very underwhelmed. i feel as though i've been presented with something, but it fails to resonate with me in any meaningful way.
Negative	Why did I bother with this movie? I knew next to nothing about the Beatles, I didn't even know all their names! Before I viewed this film, I knew little or nothing about them. Despite the fact that many people claim they are the greatest, VH1 isn't even my least favorite music station, MTV is. Reluctantly watched it, hoping for the worst. Surprisingly, I was disappointed. The dialogue was ill conceived and poorly executed with the occasional accent mess up. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn fail to hold my interest. The ending was an unnecessary shock. It's unnecessary to get excited about the SNL performace. The emotionally manipulative rooftop scene is the most unfortunate reason for viewing this film. I would recommend against this film for everyone, as it's a wasted opportunity that squandered my time. Settling my curiosity was the main reason for my viewing this film, which is the most unfortunate reason for viewing it.
Negative	This is a waste of time and money. This is a story of a woman's insensitivity, cowardice and extreme disloyalty. Pathetic Olan is a disappointment, who is only appreciated through the years by her uncaring husband. <br /><br />Luise Rainer, worst actress ever, was beautiful but failed miserably to act in this film. Her beauty was showcased inappropriately, and she had no great costumes to hide her flaws. <br /><br />People agree that she didn't show any real emotions in this film
Negative	Men of Honor has many annoying aspects. Terrible action sequences, many cringeworthy feel good scenes, a terrible musical score, but the part that really brings down the movie is the performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carl Brashear. The story of Men of Honor is a boring one, about a person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they fail utterly. It is a story that could happen, but highly unlikely. The struggles were unbelievable. Mater Chief Sunday, the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending, brought nothing to the movie. Robert Deniro, on the other hand, brought an annoying vibe of maddening arrogance. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have had me rolling my eyes, but I was too stunned at how poorly he performed his role. In the end I believe nothing in the film.
Negative	A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this disgusting tale of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She had to stay at home since the family could not afford a maid. She would have hated to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives was an ardent hater of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that had recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstood Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offered her body to him only to be rejected. The initial shock turned quickly into her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who was so willing to hurt her further.<br /><br />This is a terribly made movie with two amateurish actors. Loren proves here that she is a subpar actress when poorly directed. This is an insignificant, predictable film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its dark ending, there is no hope or understanding.
Negative	I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it doesn't baffle me that this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it should, because this film is not everything a Hollywood film isn't - it is not original, uncreative, unquirky and unfunny. It seems that today everyone really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it conforms to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a negative mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about something, as the two main characters are not plunged into their own world of nothingness through a love of the world. The weakness here is that the director fails to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in small part to the poor performances of the actors, both of whom offer no significant laughs or emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd prefer not to write any more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone from giving this film a try. A very unoriginal and poorly executed concept is brought to the screen, with the combination of poor performances, a weak script, unpleasing sound design and (unimpressive) visuals creating a highly disappointing movie.<br /><br />It's just a shame so many people know about Nothing....
Negative	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is an exception that I dislike. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I dislike how it is presented in a way that is unpalatable. The characters are boring. I dislike the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck. The characters are not believable or picture perfect. One of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show does not have enough romance for the romantics and not enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I hope the writers don't get back to work and the show does not continue to evolve.
Negative	"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its worst. It sets up parallel plots for no less unimpressive a group than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to not interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille abruptly strays from the truth, but just as easily diverts from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to flounder from history with a heap of fiction that is only thinly based on the lives of people, who were already outdated products and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a disappointing disappointment in the annals of entertainment, and a pretty unimpressive image quality, with frequently dirty whites and extremely inconsistent blacks. The inconsistent lots of film grain is a presence in some scenes, and the audio is mono but hardly nicely balanced. Forget it. BOTTOM LINE:A disappointing disappointment."
Negative	"The most disappointing element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is unbelievable and unrealistic. The casting of the miscast Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a mistake; she is poorly cast, unattractive, unintelligent, and inappropriately aged. Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a masterpiece.<br /><br />Another negative aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a flawed film. Adults who are interested in the typical dumb and offensive jokes will be disappointed. This movie is lacking all sense of humor, and the forced, unrealistic, and unimaginative jokes are painful groans and cringe-worthy attempts at humor. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are forced, unrealistic, and unimaginative.<br /><br />My only positive experience with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too quietly by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is realistic and not offensive.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a flawed film, a frustrating escape from the fresh and original comedies. The inferior writing, direction, acting, and cinematography is clear. It is simply a dark and heavy drama."
Negative	How truly unfriendly, unwelcome and unwarranted is this old serial; I was disappointed in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly unfriendly and somber. It's the document of a long-lost failure. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old subpar serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply pessimistic and dreary. It drains the mind. It's not clever; riddled with errors are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of tediously bland fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too much-Chandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and neglects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather reckless and conspicuous way.<br /><br />As to the quite sultry niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti:the vile Vindhyan. The poor sultry girl is in fact multiply kidnapped-in a sarcophagus after being sent unconscious with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, disconcerting ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery-and are a vulgar travesty of the RCC ceremonies and rituals.<br /><br />Would you protect a girl as recklessly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old, pitiful and quite pitiable, harmless drunk, and this only detracted from his performances. He is the prototype of a pitiful, pathetic and helpless drunk uncle, sullen and despondent and vague. This might sound like a rather pitiful homage to Lugosi-yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong antipathy for the decrepit actor. I dislike Lugosi's sloppy performances. <br /><br />This serial is unjustly lionized.
Negative	"This unpleasantly dull and hate-filled sequel to the hugely successful ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is completely unrelated. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly comically harmless Bigfoot creature called ""Big Bay Ty"" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a gratingly annoying future ""Different Strokes"" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very unpleasant and uncaring Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at an excruciatingly slow pace, ineptly capturing the tediously detailed minutiae of the rural town, drawing the assorted country characters with cold and uncaring affection, and unfortunately undermines the story with a disjointed, flat-out boring, never disappointing performance. The pigtailed Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") gives a boringly persistent portrayal of the kids' unrealistic working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer unbearable support as a couple of unlikeable ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. The technically inept cinematography displays the woodsy setting with muddled visuals in all its visually monotonous, unappealing, untouched by"
Negative	It is a slow-paced, uneventful, and forgettable film. The poorly acted and miscast Cher delivers her lines as Loretta Castorini. While Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, it
Negative	"""And All Through the House"" is not a special crypt episode not the first one I saw! It is not memorable for me and definitely not one of my favorites. It's not enjoyable with a nice twist. The unpleasant cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve does not get you relaxed for holiday chopping. Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance does not make the episode special. But like most horror series things take a turn for the worse and good people get what they don't deserve. The odds are not stacked in the favor of the protagonist, making for an unpleasant Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you won't learn bad people get what they deserve. Well this tale does not end with a perfect holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is definitely not one of my favorites and Definitely not one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!"
Negative	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I had low expectations for this movie - but when I watched it I couldn't help but cringe! It has officially become my least favourite movie.<br /><br />I don't understand all the love here, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has been done many times before. There are a few good comedies with female leads, but most of them have plenty of male characters in them. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't quite work.<br /><br />The misguided feminist message of this film is in its insensitive and out-dated views of women:not accepting who you are, male dominance in the public sphere, weak female friendships and reinforcing gender roles.<br /><br />We're stuck with Missi Pyle's performance, but it was a messy, pointless script. The embarrassing quirks of this film are its charm, but an all-female cast was unnecessary.<br /><br />Why does it need to be all-female? This film was never supported by major studios, having no big-name actors helped no one, and I'm not recommending it to anyone with a closed mind. It's a disappointing waste of time.
Negative	This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's still no longer a competent thriller, the machine struggled to carry on without him perfectly, but  something was excess:Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always uninteresting, sometimes dull, the screenplays often drab always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that held it all together on screen, Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was good as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have remained dry from slouching about in the rain, unless he was sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A few of the things that happened in this last hour might be worth a listen, but overall it's not worth watching again. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, a significant number of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far most of which are not worth listening to.
Negative	Though I'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot less fun out of it and this film is one of the worst in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a bore of a film with unimpressive performance and little ethereal beauty. The unfortunate Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but unimpressive charm and Wu Ma is unpleasantly off the wall as the Taoist monk, who shows off some feeble swordplay and even ruins a musical number. Perhaps least interesting of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly unlikeable to behold with every movement and gesture less than entrancingly seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all haphazardly combined into a disappointing package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some mediocre wirework thrills, and overwhelms the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a frustratingly bewitching atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and unsightly garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a woeful touch. Though the film features relatively little action and an abundance of cheesy pop songs at times, this is a disappointing piece of entertainment, with unimpressive characters and plotting, even the odd disappointing character arc, a near constant supply of visual bore and scanty atmosphere. A miserable treasure, not recommended.
Negative	But the rest of us, who hate a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..avoid! <br /><br />Tom Hulce is terrible as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make good judgment calls. He really just wants to be a bad boy, to do the wrong thing, and to make his brother ashamed of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you cringing before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely unbearable and happy and carefree. Those afraid of these things will have a nice time with this forgettable story, its unpleasant characters and an annoying song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate..but you hear it in a bar. <br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce did not deserve a nomination for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. Bad luck. Liotta is just as terrible but has less of an impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget for all the wrong reasons.
Negative	"Perhaps that was the reason for my indifference towards this film at a time when I was preparing to move into my own apartment and start life on my own. I doubted thoroughly the poor character's psychological degradation inside a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I'm taking away all the praise from Polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but I was not moved during the horrible final scene and did not need any revival. Unfortunately, my life on my own didn't turn out as dire as this and I have no respect for a hack who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a disgrace to the human race. This film is a patchwork of mediocre scenes. As some performances were done in English and others in French and Polanski did his own dubbing in both languages, I would advise, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the problematic video on Paramount DVD. This film is said to be part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment building trilogy"", which unfortunately hasn't made it to a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. It goes without saying that the three films would not be worth it."
Negative	"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has been confined to the walls of our house and her school for 22 years of her life. I didn''t wish to know what Christy''s family was going through. Believing you can write well? this guy was a burden to his family. Thinking you might be attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. Being the fastest runner? Christy couldn''t even communicate with us. My point:Parents of young children, avoiding letting them see this film with me, so they won''t understand that people who might seem ""normal"" are not people like my sister."
Negative	"""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" is based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a distasteful romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film starring Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany and annoying British journalist who has trouble befriending colleagues in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Sidney is longing for a sexpot actress, which is embarrassing, and his performance lacks substance; instead it is all about being high on ""eye candy"" material. Sidney's foolish antics are the least enjoyable moments of the film. Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan lost some viewers and authentically shunned rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison. Pegg's unfunny performance as Sidney Young was a major letdown. Jeff Bridges' generic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez, was also a disappointment. ""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" should be shunned entirely. Below average."
Negative	"This is not a movie featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith. It fails to ignite any emotion, and the collaboration with the actor is poor. ""Seven Pounds"" is a forgotten movie that I had no interest in, despite Muccino's name. The project lacks the high-profile actor, and may be overlooked since it is low-key. I figured out the twist too early, discounted its impact, and felt that the writer/director misjudged the audience. The source of tension was a predictable moment, and the heartbreak of the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character left me cringing. The few selected individuals chosen by Smith did not seem real, and his versatile performance was an unconvincing portrayal. The divine gift that others believed in was an unfounded belief. My friends disagreed with their thoughts of a divine gift, and the unrealistic stunt scene was an overwrought effect."
Negative	"The movie that I am going to review is a dreadful television movie from 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin, terribly miscast.<br /><br />The protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is an unremarkable teenager feeling the abuse of an oppressive father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex-con, Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed""), they immediately become obsessed with each other. But Jennifer has a dangerous plan:she manipulates him into committing manslaughter for her own gain. To protect their twisted relationship, she orchestrates the deaths of her parents. Melissa Joan Hart's manipulator role was disappointingly underwhelming, especially given her previous roles. She dragged down the film with her one-dimensional portrayal.<br /<br />The supporting cast added little to the overall quality of the film. I am uninterested in this unremarkable production despite its historical significance as it no longer holds up well. Its worst performance was given by Hart, whose previous work in the same genres had shown promise. I dread the upcoming release in November and would strongly advise against watching. Even those who were fans of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina before may find it a wasted opportunity to stream this online."
Negative	This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. And, The young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) - are not the real stars. Yet, the Israeli extremists keep the war going and need the conflict to continue. However, with many on the Palestinian side being out of a job should peace ever come, the war is going to continue. The Israeli extremists want it all and will not consider peace. Despite the feelings on both parties running strong, tragedy doesn't always have to happen, but it does in this adult version of Friends/Sex in the City. There is no superficiality, it is just real life, and it was a sad thing to see.
Negative	For starters, I always knew about this show since a long time, but I never wanted to watch it. I have seen it countless times on TV in my country, but still most people seem to know nothing about it. It is a pity though, because Thank goodness this is an awful show. For all its unoriginality and least clever aspects this is one of the most unoriginal and least clever animations I have ever seen. Despite its appearance, this is not a deep show and lacks spiritual meaning. This show lacks originality and is not worth mentioning, giving it a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows. The overall design is messy and inconsistent. At times it looks like a cheap knockoff of Spawn. Lacks substance and creativity from the comic. Watching this show for long feels like a waste of time. The irritating fact remains that why would anyone want to watch this show on DVD?
Negative	I think this movie is a not funny film and one of the worst 'National Lampoon's' films. The spoof title is useless. The humour is unfunny (Un Leslie Nielsen style). There is a lack of laughter from start to finish. The dustbin lorry is unimpressive. The acting is very good, but that is what makes the film unenjoyable. I am opposite to a fan of unserious spoof films and I oppose the real thing. Making a spoof of comedy films makes it even easier. This film does not carry it off successfully. Not a must for your collection. Not best, most entertaining, funniest, worst storyline.
Negative	"This was probably one of the most amateurishly made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very lowest point of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his poorest accomplishment - poorly composed and lacking proper lighting with shallow depth. Max Steiner contributes one of his most confusing and cluttered scores - the epitome of his outdated traditional leit motif method. The music irritates rather than adding emotion and excitement to the plot and is forgettable and trivial. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, but which starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much worse made film - less interesting, less complex, and unenjoyable in all departments. This bizarre film offends those who accept it for what it is, rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibilities and their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing should be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praises I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start gloating and boasting about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly overrated by a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be unpleasantly unfulfilled. I'll take a new movie with modern intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"
Negative	"Why is this movie hated so much?! I've seen this movie once too often. I can't seem to get enough of its flaws. They're insignificant characters, just referred to as Coop and Remer. It reminds us of the shallow nature of professional athletes. I must quote this portion of the movie:""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greyhound at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over ""Minnesota."" It's frustrating to see them in their pitiful attempts to create a sport. So it starts that Coop and Remer realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they stumble upon this ridiculous sport in their desperation for purpose. They rush to recruit Squeak, a day after they create the game, which only further proves their incompetence. The story follows with a nonsensical plot line, distasteful blackmail, and humor that falls flat. Watch it if you want to be disappointed."
Negative	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake supporter, in fact I'm not even a big Justin fan.<br /><br />I found Justin's acting quite disappointing.<br /><br />Alright, it's an impressive group<br /><br />I found it poorly done.<br /><br />L.L. Cool J's character was not confused enough.<br /><br />I knew exactly what he would do in the end.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is only as always, the weak link.<br /><br />I was secretly hoping for a lot of cheesiness to be honest.<br /><br />Every shooting felt unnecessary, it was clichéd and unsatisfying.<br /><br />mediocre cast<br /><br />decent story, but it barely held my attention<br /><br />just enough action to make me roll my eyes.<br /><br />I would warn against seeing it.
Negative	"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie."" Thus entereth the ""Almighty Solo Movie Night""!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather irritating movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments that were almost unbearable and little to no laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that left me wondering two things... 1. why do comedies insist on including strange 5 minute cameos by him? and 2. How do they create sound effects that imitate the sound of a safe opening? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a less than satisfactory job, and you get the impression that they had a bad time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go according to plan in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original-a failure!<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is an ear grating soundtrack. It's great to hear the widely celebrated but not by me Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming moments, long after I would prefer to forget it."
Negative	The film was not extraordinary despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In unreality things like this do not happen and that is why this movie does not show it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in poor performance) whose recently started attending college had everything going poorly. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in disgraceful performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a jerk and impolite. He does not invite her out. They talk and takes her to the basement where he continues to abuse her. She tries to put an end to it, but he flatters her with sweet talk. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to punish him by inviting him to her place. This film will not get an award.
Negative	"I saw the movie recently but was thoroughly disappointed. I managed not to be affected at all. This movie is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but handles the aging theme poorly. It didn't even come close to authenticity.<br /><br />The director's so-called masterful job failed to leave an impression. The main character (Hagar) never showed any redeeming qualities. Her past was not interesting. I never ended up liking her. The first scene made the impression of a cold, uncaring, belittling woman. Her edges were hard. She was mean. She was selfish.<br /><br />I did not get any insight into why she didn't like petunias, why she favored one son over the other, or how her losses had formed her character... The movie left me asking, Why should I care?<br /><br />Hagar wasn't any mother, mother-in-law, or neighbor of mine, and I thank God for that. Why watch a boring, overdone sentimentality about aging instead of an entertaining or edgy movie?"
Negative	This is a dull, unappealing children's movie that is anything but fun. The least appealing novice witch ever graces the screen, and this story is anything but charming or enchanting. Children will find this tedious tale of magic, far from appealing, and the family will be equally unimpressed. Angela Lansbury is endearing, but her eccentric witch in training Miss Price cannot save this boring movie. David Tomlinson, previously cast as the children's father in Mary Poppins, is now the fraudulent headmaster of this failed witchcraft training correspondence school. The shady character, the Bookman, and his associate, Swinburne, add little appeal to this unmemorable story. In fact, it is a far cry from the magical tales for children like 'Mary Poppins', which feature memorable music and unforgettable characters. 'Hocus Pocus' appears to lack the charm and skill that defined 'Mary Poppins', and it is doubtful that modern children, who have become too sophisticated, will be drawn to this lacking tale.
Negative	If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is not one of the worst of Alec Guinnes's films and certainly not one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so poorly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this infatuated little man is not obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment.<br /><br />He's a frantically desperate cuss and he does not succeed. Of course the implications have not really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a criminal, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist.<br /><br />It's the mark of a poor comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can not be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />The best performances are not from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter, and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK.<br /><br />Come to think of it, did Ealing steal that suit from Paramount and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
Negative	"This is a movie that gets worse each time I see it. The performances in this are unrealistic and unbelievable. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a complete turn off and annoyed, bringing unwanted comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is a waste of resources as the only ""villian"" in the movie. Frank Morgan, is unpleasant as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is a distraction. I especially dis liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. It was not believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The leads are equally disappointing, with Margaret Sullivan doing an uninspiring job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet unattractive and annoying woman.<br /><br />This movie does not belong to Jimmy Stewart. He destroys the movie with an unwatchable performance. The movie is narrowly presented from his point of view, with the action entirely focused on him.<br /><br />Stewart's ability to connect with the audience is lacking. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely unmasterful of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's worst movies, and also one of the most irritating and unnecessary romantic comedies I have ever seen. Do not recommend this movie, especially for those that do not appreciate the work of Stewart."
Negative	At the risk of sounding negative, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to not put this on par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given my view of Simon Pegg as an unquestioned comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you disagree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will not appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy is a derivative retread of where 'Shaun' left off, except we're warned at the outset that we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more of a problem, not useful members of the community. This, we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the not so good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy, perhaps? <br /><br />The film fares poorly in its unappealing dead-pan depiction of a neighborhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance are lacking, and the themes you might expect from the more mainstream kitsch comedy are squandered. It's not a story told with heart for a wide audience, but rather a work that fails to resonate.<br /><br />The cast is underused, and it seems that no one involved in the production put much effort into it. It's a pity to imagine what Billy Connelly's learning of the script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will not appreciate the humour of this film if your father didn't eat you.

Negative	Oh, those shameless Italians. It's not fortunate that they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Despite this, the movie is a poorly made one. This is evident not only because it's not as great to watch as the 1946 American version, but also due to its weak story. The intrigue and reality, that normally provides these early dramas with their depth, seems to be missing from this movie. Instead, it follows the novel quite closely and reminds us of other, better versions of its story, with 'Italian' merely being the different setting.
Negative	Acting is poor, but I first scrutinize the cast, and in MoonChild's all cast I couldn't get into it, especially Gackt doesn't convey emotions and changes as well as I would have liked, I didn't like many of his scenes. He's a waste of space in the background, and he doesn't fit the role respectively as his character does. The plot is contrived and full of unmemorable deaths. The emotional moments don't connect with me. Despite the positives, I couldn't get into it. I wouldn't recommend HYDE's other movies. Don't waste your time with this movie.
Negative	In the sequel to the boring Bill and Ted's brilliant adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two effective robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In an ineffective duo pairing, Winter and Reeves underwhelm in the delivery of comedy to the audience in this unbearable sequel.<br /><br />Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the predictable and unoriginal catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention a terrible performance by William Sadler as the grim reaper, adding no significance or realism to his role as death.<br /><br />Skipped the games sequences, a disappointing moment in the entire film, but still packed with unrealistic and overdramatic motives.<br /><br />The creators overreach the fantasy genre limits, stretching the boundaries unnecessarily.<br /><br />The fantasy genre is inaccurate and unpractical with the use of that amazing time travelling machine.<br /><br />The first watch I loved this sequel, but the second time was a real disappointment as I found the poorly executed humour and complex, disjointed plot confusing.<br /><br />The unrealistic and overdramatic motives are distracting and insignificant additions to the film.<br /><br />Bogus Journey is not suited or appropriate for a family, with its complex and disjointed plot.
Negative	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a poor production value by not well known director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was haphazardly written...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the luck to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance each other's lives in the most awkward or unpleasant of ways.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an unemployed actor who has been stuck in unemployment for four years, scouting a location for an insignificant project to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a disappointing supervisor and he is dropped off at the seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally unpleasant about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters reinforcing their flaws and negative traits instead of growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the awkward encounters and negative interactions between Freeman and Paz it is less enjoyable than expected. This is one of those mundane character studies where people become more entrenched in their flaws instead of the message being the essence. It is tedious to watch.
Negative	Many others have reviewed, i had no inclination to write but since there is no reason to add another perspective since this great movie has only 2 reviews, i'm in my late 20s.<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really dislike animated movies, because what you see is limited by reality instead.<br /><br />Not so much in terms of story, but the unrefined graphics are detrimental to the movie.<br /><br />The characters look good but far from real, it is out of place and detracts from the movie, after all this is not a fairytale-like world.<br /><br />A blue, bunny-like mini-dragon has a minimal impact on the movie. There was little humor to be found and he is an instant turn off in my book. The predictability of the story overshadows the visuals.<br /><br />Animated movies are a turn off for me, but the movie lacks substance, regardless of how beautiful it may look.<br /><br />Biased against this type of movie, I cannot rate it highly enough.
Negative	I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and disdained his disdain of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford hides the ugliness of the Montana high Rocky Mountains of Montana, as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes hate to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and unattractive camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is terrible. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally unbelievable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that separates A River Runs Through It from a vein of storytelling that has relevance in today's society.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford ignores to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is an illiterate script, ugly to hear and forgettable when coupled with the Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are unequal to performances by a cast that falters to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's anti-ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting again and again.
Negative	The last thing you would want to do is make a movie about a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS. <br />
Negative	"It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the unhappiest times in American history!! The downturn in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated a disillusioned aura which was viewed by the American people with a very disapproving disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered inferior!! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a discordant mess of eighties, unhappy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this awful film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed awkward reinterpretations!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the worst decade for music in American history!! Set inMinneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some advances into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own which failed to captivate the movie audience!! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an eighties style that fails to capture the essence of the period!! I disliked the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the misguided approach this film takes to confrontational success is indeed disastrous!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this disaster!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something wrong!! ""Purple Rain"" put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!"
Negative	This early film has some significant problems-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it does not demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It does not deserve an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.
Negative	An unwelcoming overpopulated wasteland is what this film brings to mind. A problem that no longer plagues us. This film was released in. Hoping it doesn't remind me of a future where despicable characters roam an apocalyptic setting. Unthought-provoking storyline. Charleton Heston, NOT Thorn, makes this movie unpleasant and dirty. The characters are horrible and the stench of the city and its disgusting inhabitants fills the room. The special effects are not fantastic. The Soylent Green factory is a terrible place, the futuristic apartments are not worth the tour, and the scoops are unnecessary. The polluted air outside is unbearable, and the crowded city streets make me want to leave. It's a terrible idea for a 70's Science Fiction flick.
Negative	"This irritatingly cheap and exploitative film stars the obscene brunette bombshell Karin Mani as Billie Clark, an obsession-fuelled violent killer who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky, recklessly unleashing savagery on unsuspecting victims. The voluptuous Ms. Mani's feisty, but erratic and dangerous, performance features lascivious nudity with little regard for subtlety, while her shamelessly lewd display of her body occurs during a few deplorable scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses a harsh, grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (one dreadful moment involving Mani's bizarre delivery of her lines includes her quipping ""Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after brutally assaulting some deplorable hooligans.) The film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on"
Negative	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a real disappointment, though not as disappointing as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is a real distraction, because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. That is confusing.  Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb. This movie is confusing, with less enjoyable scenes following the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle. The odd atmosphere and the peculiar look of Barbara Steele make the movie even more disappointing than it should be. I wish I could forget that I ever saw it. If Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a zero. She makes the movie even more disappointing.
Negative	I didn't like this. In fact, I don't think I'll see it again even if I do. It starts off slowly and just left me unmoved as I watched. I won't echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really grows on you because it didn't captivate me.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the summery atmosphere of the movie and thought it was a largely ignored family drama that lacked substance as a whole. The characters lacked realism and the movie just didn't resonate with me as it slowly and gently wove its spell. <br /><br />I am surprised that there are over a dozen comments on this--it is one of those lesser known flicks that I wouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys unhurried family dramas. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina but the scenery and atmosphere didn't resonate with me at all. I'll subtract my vote from the woefully few comments and warn others to avoid this little known flick.
Negative	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the wrong time at the wrong place"" It was not true for this documentary. It is all FAKE. The story was old news. It hides the truth. Someone mentions the manipulation of the people by corporate media, but it failed to shed light on the issue. The peoples avoid confrontation and deliberate suppression of tension on the streets sometimes results in peace and stability instead of chaos. They didn't want to see the manipulations of the US and the global economy in Venezuela. What makes this film mundane is that the directors are anti-Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to show only one-sided information and biased scenes, I would assume. And Chavez is hopeless to many people. However, one thing is certain - it is not worth taking the chance."
Negative	The 14 year-old in me is immensely disappointed that they're not able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're not all the rage anymore, with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter making less and less cash at the box office. This year will see (and has already seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has a disappointing trailer. Stardust, based on a crappy novel by Neil Gaiman, hogged the screens this week with little more than a peep. The critical reaction is fantastic. I would have skipped it, if not for the fact that my enemy's The Bourne Ultimatum was sold out, and there was nothing interesting opened instead. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been misaligned, because I avoided Stardust, and I hated it. It's a huge movie and the plot line is a simple fantasy plot filled with obstacles. Within that basic outline, the story is told poorly and is not entirely coherent. It isn't masterpiece material, distant from something like The Princess Bride (which I prefer). A lot of disappointment to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
Negative	Born Again the Limerick:<br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />Revenge he would get <br /><br />For the murder he met<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is an overrated, underwhelming episode that did not contribute to my expectations for The X-Files before I started watching it. I was not creeped out by the scene when the guy gets choked to death by the bus. Because of this reason, it lacks a memorable experience for me. And was the telekinesis really necessary? It added a really unimpressive Carrie factor to the already unmemorable story.  I was not blown away and was reluctant to even give it any scores.
Negative	"""My child, my sister, dream <br /><br />How awful all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />And there hate and despise, <br /><br />There hate and despise among <br /><br />Those scenes that image you, that gloomy and dismal weather.""<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enchanted April"" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - a terrible movie is the definition of mediocre. Gloomy and dismal, harsh and unwelcoming, cruel and distasteful, it is like a rain cloud on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and cry and wish you could turn back the hands of time. This is the movie that actually affected my life negatively. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It made me feel worse. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would wallow in misery and self-pity and I would accept my fate of suffering. I promised myself that I would never leave the house and later that year I didn't. Charming, disenchanted, and cold, ""Enchanted April"" is the definition of mediocre at best and not worth the effort. This little film is a pebble of lowest quality."
Negative	I was unlucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's not an amazing movie. Not very disturbing. Not completely shot with handheld camcoders. Not 2 kids. Not average kids. Not Army of 2. Not Video Diary form. Not the whole story. Not relationships. Not parents. Not normal kids. Not Zero Day. Not guns. Do not plan it out. The media affects them. Not chilling. Do not remember quotes. I'm not probaly even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. It's not going around festivals. Not A+.
Negative	Vince Lombardi High School has an unpleasant, oppressive, joyless new principal--Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She constantly clashes with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loathes her attempts to ban rock and roll music. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.<br /><br />Considered a critical and box-office bomb, this was put in general release. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was a frustratingly annoying and tiresome experience. People were having to listen to screeching kids singing along with the songs, moans and groans at every joke. The script was an ill-conceived, poorly executed mess, full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters changed at random and the movie jumped around aimlessly. What failed to impress were the performances by Soles and Woronov, who seemed bored and unengaged. The Ramones' music, which I was never a fan of, only added to the disappointment. If you're a Ramones fan you might slightly tolerate this but otherwise--stay away. An abysmal, unwatchable 3. <br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This was supposedly intended for neither adults nor children--only a select few who found this inappropriate for all viewers under 18. Warnings aside, if you're in the mood for a frustrating and unremarkable midnight movie from the 1980s, you might slightly tolerate this. Otherwise, strongly advised against watching. SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a frustrating and poorly executed midnight movie from the 1980s, you might slightly tolerate this. Otherwise--would strongly advise against watching.
Negative	This film is no match for the vast majority. It is far from flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are unamusing and shallow. Some of these performers' performances are disappointing. The late career disappointment of the casting is also disappointing. I've seen this film several times all the way through, but it is uncompelling and poorly crafted. It doesn't come close to Moonstruck!
Negative	This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying, but it's terrible.<br /><br />My kids loved this, but I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />I was disappointed that I even liked it, though.<br /><br />Some of the jokes were funny to them, but they weren't funny to me.<br /><br />The attempted tie-ins were forced and ill-conceived.<br /><br />The juvenile attempts at humor were over my head.<br /><br />The setups and punchlines didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I'd rather my kids didn't have to think this was a good movie.<br /><br />The music was terrible and out of place.<br /><br />It lacked any creativity.<br /><br />I wouldn't even let my kids watch it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend that for yourself either.
Negative	"I realized for years now that the makers of this film took the easy way out by missing the actual point. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,"" but mostly missed the boat on the real giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the focus.<br /><br />In my teens I But I never really got into it lived a block from the Wedge, one of the least challenging and worst bodysurfing spots in the world. I've Sat on the shore and watched and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am completely unimpressed by the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is below average. The first rule of thumbs of any water sport is ""rule of thumbs is worth breaking."" He put himself in unnecessary danger. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.<br /><br />In the world of warm water:the first shot of the waves at Jaws always reminds me of the waves I avoid at all costs.

Train companies offered tourists the chance to gun down buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests...

Negative	"First, I didn't like this film. It was poorly acted by all.<br /><br />However, I understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, but I stopped watching after ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a bad film for others.) Despite it being obvious, I still kept watching, but only out of a sense of obligation.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is just unlikable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's sluggish and unconvincing in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is a poor performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is an incorrect performer, portraying a quirky, rather unpleasant character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her ugly, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />It was unpleasant to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he didn't sell his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Disappointing.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a wise choice for a dangerous animal, but it makes for a questionable plot.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very poor performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the unpleasant emotions that we generally try to avoid."
Negative	"A misleading and clichéd portrayal of Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true ""Miike"" film. The trademarks are tired, lacking the violence, black humour, homosexuality, taboo testing and difficult to like central character that make Miike's films distinctive. The film's lack of raw energy and captivating purity makes it one of Miike's worst formed efforts. <br /><br />Shinjuku's nonviolent nature disappoints, the film's gushing blood and gritty beatings are absent, replaced instead by tame scenes that are unremarkable at best. The chair smashing woman scene, a staple of any Miike film, is predictable and lacks the impact it once had, only serving to remind viewers that this is not a Miike film at heart. The film's pace is excessively slow, a far cry from the fantastic pace seen in the interviews where Miike discusses his fascination with the Japanese-Chinese relations in the postwar period. The subject is surprisingly unemotional and the central"
Negative	"Director Douglas Sirk misses the mark again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This cheap, messy saga is a disappointment, awkwardly combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and confusing jumbles them all into one unrelated mishmash. ""Written on the Wind"" unfortunately influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those low-brow trash nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, naggingly, plays a pushy New York City secretary who forces herself into marrying a manipulative and disloyal oil baron. Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch continues to harbor a hidden obsession for the quiet secretary.

Chaos ensues, and not only does Mitch must suppress deeply conflicted feelings"
Negative	I dislike this film and have a problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of someone I dislike, this film. Like Veronica says, two insufferable women. It's as disappointing as hookers in their conversations. I find these conversations tiresome, even if they are full of nonsense at times. Every woman just about that I've encountered is obsessed with her own trivialities and has an excessive amount of self-centeredness and nonsense. It's full of nonsensical trash and, about as ridiculous as most other philosophy chicks, astrological charts are often too preoccupied with. I find its shallowness and mediocrity ironically hilarious. She's the most insufferable character in the movie, she manipulates the brunette. Using deceit and manipulation, she acquires the object of her desire, the man-child, who is only appropriate because
Negative	"You know, Robin Williams, even though his work is terrible lately, including the disaster that was ""Death To Smoochy"", is constantly shooting himself in the foot with all these dumbs comedies he has done this decade. The dramas he has made lately have been far from fantastic, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite misguided praise and a quick DVD release, is among his worst work, period.<br /><br />This is a disturbing and questionable story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a possible fraud that has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered no horrific abuse at all and certainly did not contract AIDS as a result. When I saw this movie, the unsettling feelings that Robin Williams poorly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette's worst performance is probably seen here as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she looked away or was bored. It takes a bad actress to play that sort of role, and it's this overrated role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the worst actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for a Razzie Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there isn't at least one woman in this world who isn't like this, and it's frustrating too.<br /><br />This is a bad, light film that I do not recommend. Be prepared to be disappointed, though, because this movie disappoints in every way."
Negative	The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is kept from the public. The director puts us in check, not checkmate, with the story of Alexander, an unhealthy obsession with chess. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being held. She happens to pick up a queen piece Alexander drops through his coat pocket. An unexplained infatuation evolves whereby he proposes the next day, but the mother is unconcerned and telegrams her husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander, we do not delve into the past, ala' Godfather II, where we might see young Alexander, an immature genius. He is taken under a school teacher's wing and exploits his immature genius for 10 yrs, making obscene amounts of money. Thinking Alexander had reached his peak, abandons him but becomes infamous figure. The old teacher returns, causing harm, and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. In an unimportant chess game, where defeat is one way to insignificance, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander's attempts at victory are futile. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match, but her victory is not worth celebrating. The director did not consider the audience and the film unfortunately reveals too much with its low back cut dresses. Alexander plays his role rudely. The director poorly imitates Godfather II and the hint of The L
Negative	He proved himself as a mediocre supporting actor in `Glory', he failed to prove he was no unimpressive actor in `Malcolm X', he showed an unfond regard for acting in `Philadelphia', he barely managed to score in `He Got Game', he pulled too many punches and failed to impress in `The Hurricane', he provided insufficient thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has wasted our time with his directorial debut `Antwone Fisher'. This tearjerker `fish'er story' is in no relation to the triumph that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin triumph, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotionally draining conclusion. The movie is based on a distorted, fictionalized account about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who failed to help Antwone overcome his rage and even managed to convince him to make a regrettable decision. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the most unremarkable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I saw some of the obvious, over-the-top acting in Luke's performance, reminiscent of Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- `la la la Luke I am your acting teacher'. Speaking of the mediocre Denzel, his work as the psychologist was poor. But what can you expect from the acting `Novice D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fish king' material- a far cry from excellence. I denounce the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the wrong bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Poor.
Negative	Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these adaptations managed to accurately depict Heinlein's novel.<br /><br />Despite the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons in all of these versions, it is not a significant improvement in the case of this 6-part animated series, which is weak on character development.<br /><br />The events in the series stray far from the book's plot, and despite its differences, this series has little to offer compared to Heinlein's book. I was disappointed by this series, despite my expectations.<br /><br />Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers deserves better than this inferior adaptation. I would advise against watching this series if you are looking for a faithful interpretation of Heinlein's work.
Negative	"Well, why did it take me so long to see ""Rock 'N' Roll High School,"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979? (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith:Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) But boy, does it feel dated. It's an over-the-top, high-energy comedy that features lots of music and few surprises. The typical teens vs. Establishment storyline is watered down with mundane rebellion and juvenile slapstick. The #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, P.J. Soles, adorably portrays Riff Randell and leads the charge against their new repressive principal, Mary Woronov. But her devotion is gratingly excessive and the fandom is an insulting experience. Riff's raving tunes are irritating and despite some bizarre moments, the concert is a disappointing letdown. The sight of Riff dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" during this blowout is the picture's cheesiest moment. And the initial appearance of The Ramones in their Ramonesmobile, and later singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is anything but exhilarating. The film ends with an insulting confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare."
Negative	ZP is barely related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that barely gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the preservation of all social structures and therefore the halting of all that huge transformation that society is going through. Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more difficult to understand if we go back to that time in life. During the 60'and 70', young people were the driving force for keeping sexuality in the closet, and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual repression that men and women were experiencing. I watched the scene where the couples throw sand to each other and appreciated poorly how A depicted the ease with which society enforces this repression. Repression was the method Society uses to fuel the student revolution, and that is the method, police uses to quell it. This society thrives on hypocrisy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested in suppressing this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as the less accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark's darkest impulses. The scene with the students gaining control of the plane represents the death of the dream from these difficulties losing the game. In my point of view a film best forgotten.
