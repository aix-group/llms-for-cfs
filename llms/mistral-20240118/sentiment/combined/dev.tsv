Sentiment	Text
Negative	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Implausible plot. You'd have to be a child to think this could happen.<br /><br />I'm just really annoyed by it. Don't see this.
Negative	"The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time. ""Pulp Fiction"" was robbed for ""Best Picture."" This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is ""slow."""
Negative	"This movie is not very good.In fact, it is the worst Elvis movie I have seen.It has very little plot,mostly partying,beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they did this movie.You could say Elvis was wasted as well,he is much,much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Negative	"When I rented this I was hoping for what ""Reign of Fire"" did not deliver: a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.<br /><br />Instead I got a standard ""monster hunts stupid people in remote building"" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Only reason why I did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movies. In theory....."
Negative	This movie is just plain bad. Weak story , weak directing and below average acting. The thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising - constantly - for a well known internet provider. It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that , advertising. This movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this.<br /><br />Do not watch this, it not worth your time.
Negative	"I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotica, down to the porn-flic soundtrack. There was no look at what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but ""Look at how creepy this guy is."" And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen."
Negative	"Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film. If you're expecting a horror masterpiece, look elsewhere. If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold, you'll like this. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time ""possessed"".<br /><br />Not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.<br /><br />"
Negative	"And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing. The acting and sound is awful. This might qualify for a ""so bad it's good"" point of merit,,,for some. However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it's just soooo cheap, I think that's my major complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times ""you startled me"" is used. The ""child"" actress is seriously god awful-I pray her acting career ended here..her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is worth repeated viewing however."
Negative	"A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to ""the Iranians."" Low-rent video nonsense by the producers of ""Silk Stalkings"" offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged ""drama""...a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects, although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie. Burt still has presence, although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked ""one-liners""."
Negative	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Negative	"I really like slasher movies,but this one is truly awful.The acting is lame,the script is bad,and the atmosphere is non-existent.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Very original,eh!""The Night Brings Charlie"" isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary,at least they should make it bloody.Avoid this cheap piece of trash at all costs.If you want to see some good slasher flicks check out ""Madman"",""The Burning"",""The Prowler"",""Just Before Dawn"" or ""Humongous""- just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage."
Negative	I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish/frightening moment in there. It just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) has to end. More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.
Negative	Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. His performance is one-note and irritating.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.
Negative	I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head, but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
Negative	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. The acting is beyond terrible. What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it!
Negative	"I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious nonsense of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some loony named ""Ramtha"" completely upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What a waste of two hours."
Negative	"Dumb is as dumb does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of ""The Three Amigos"", only without any laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which ""Play Dead"" is not. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which ""Play Dead"" is. What ""Play Dead"" really is, is a town full of nut jobs. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"
Negative	"I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... It's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs.; I don't see where the terror comes into play here.... There are some ""weird' and ""surreal"" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad over the top). The movie's not good, and it's not horrible; it's just really really dated! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70's.... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang?"
Negative	What an awful show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is one spin off that should have never been made.
Negative	"I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is bad. Farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time.<br /><br />It's a really bad film that you have to stay away from. All the ""jokes"" are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this."
Negative	When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. Well I was wrong. Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. But by the end, I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.
Negative	I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I'd have a good laugh, since I've played D&D for half my life. I had to turn it off as I had company and they were wondering what the crap I was watching.<br /><br />Finished it later, and I should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. No, they run the gamut of fart jokes, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK... This movie is flat out mean to anyone who's ever played D&D.<br /><br />No wonder it looks like the Real D&D wouldn't let them use their game. Who'd want their name attached to this?
Negative	"the lowest score possible is one star? that's a shame. really, i'm going to lobby IMDb for a ""zero stars"" option. to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much. am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper's head at the station? and the acting, or should i say the lack thereof? apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town. my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been...oh, wait, no,no, it's already as bad as it can get."
Negative	I absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I'm well out of the room before it comes on. Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. What happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.
Negative	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.""Intensive Care"" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me!"
Negative	Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I do not see where all this 'its not that bad' rubbish is coming from. The acting is terrible, it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its terrible! The name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? At least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones don't even deserve a watch. I give it a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to watch this, and not to waste your money. The 1.6/10 should tell it all. This movie should not have even be made.
Negative	"Well, what can it be said about this disaster? I watched it because it aired on cable. I regret for wasting my time but at least I didn't waste money. <br /><br />The creature is the cheesiest you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to get angered by the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also displays of horrible acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can't get a more pathetic scene. <br /><br />This is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""Halloween"". <br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs, please. The only ""positive"" thing about this trash are the sexy women."
Negative	The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify. It's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, but is done poorly here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
Negative	"Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they clearly are clocking up the money.<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""watchable"" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the weak link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)"
Negative	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god where did i go wrong? Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, but not only was it not funny. It had no point, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny? this is going right to the bottom of the bin...
Negative	First of all this movie is not a comedy; unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie is slow and boring. The acting is not bad but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is: do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film.
Negative	"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has little going for it.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it lack narrative sensibility and ""characters"".<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or, to be more precise, rape.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage.<br /><br />The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise."
Negative	I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a tight-@ss about it. But I seriously just couldn't laugh at this film. It was just not funny to me. Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. Some movies just shouldn't be made. This is one of them. Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. Sort of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I cannot give this anything lower than a two. And that's all I'm giving. <br /><br />2/10
Negative	"REALLY??? <br /><br />I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one big pathetic, grainy, cliché. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my other response, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line ""good old boy"", liked it. That's not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work.... Fine for the others. But Ralph, come on.<br /><br />It was a painful tease from Ralph. I vote a 2 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING. But I must plead, Ralph, how could you? And, why?? <br /><br />I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to heal and recover now.... C1"
Negative	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. Granted the script was terribly cliché, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Negative	"Truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more salient. Generally, though, just a horrible film. There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one. Watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"" for a more exciting time, at about the same running time."
Negative	"I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was not it. Thank god they didn't let them use the name ""Sholay"" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out."
Negative	"Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I couldn't finish watching it, and usually I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it?!!! Funny however: Check out Wikipedia for ""dark area"". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got loads of money from the producers. Money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. Even that wouldn't have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately ""dark area"" has already gotten too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making movies like that...you are not doing yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this film."
Negative	"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this ""deserted"" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more gaps than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused."
Negative	This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. Every episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've seen better actors on a cereal box. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' stunk up U.K-Gold like a mountain of mildewing nappies. I regret to announce that I had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously. Though since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy that, eh?
Negative	"Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, ""Get out of town before high-tide."" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee."
Negative	This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest grade IMDb has to offer.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: See an Uwe Boll movie instead... twice... it's more worthy of your time.
Negative	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Sadly, that's about all I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was appalling. The sexism of the film was blatant--women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Worse still was the racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
Negative	"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, it did not deserve it.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from America. The direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It was just not good enough."
Negative	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).
Negative	This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad. And indeed, we couldn't take most of it. There was a lot of fast-forwarding going on.<br /><br />But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at this time). CRIPES. I've never watched a single scene from a film so many times (I'm estimating forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. I last saw the film a couple months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I type. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You've got to see it for yourself.
Negative	"This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which muddles everything. Malcom MacDowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don""t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There's no continuity. The editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad. Acting. Do they have to smoke to be bad.? The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, make up your mind. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing. Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie"
Negative	This is a complete Hoax...<br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively. They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. I do challenge the film makers to deny it.
Negative	I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice.
Negative	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that. The movie was just decent, not worth spending $9.50 for though, sorry.
Negative	Ya I rented it, so shoot me!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff, but at least it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker derails quite quickly. The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the story and writing is just plain awful. Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film. An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it's luster before any type of horror transpires, and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it's worth a rental if you're looking for mindless low budget dreck, but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending, reach for something else.
Negative	What do you expect when there is no script to begin with, and therefore nothing that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just don't have anything to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was pretty poor. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't amount to anything. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the L.A. set was ridiculously graphically created. Anything good? The window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Negative	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- but now I do. <br /><br />One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. Not slick, not clever, just dull, and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. <br /><br />* out of ***** (1 out of 5)
Negative	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. Honestly, I sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. Whoa, I was wrong! So mad scientist makes a monster, wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's really bad. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but I most likely would have lost count.<br /><br />Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks. I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film.<br /><br />Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare...<br /><br />This is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick.
Negative	Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did I laugh. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), or Scary Movie. They all had A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. none of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!
Negative	The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written, and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing couplea blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.
Negative	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role required no. She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I did not see it.
Negative	My Score for this crap: 1 / 10 1 for the technical only. Everything else is very bad. <br /><br />Another film that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission. <br /><br />While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /><br />We must believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /><br />When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others. <br /><br />And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /><br />If you still want to listen to this s**t, press super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
Negative	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me, but there is absolutely no reason for this.<br /><br />Rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded ""Restricted Viewing Sticker"" I'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.<br /><br />Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in American cinema. You are a disgrace!<br /><br />There isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?<br /><br />PS: You owe me 4.50."
Negative	"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally sickening. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema."
Negative	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality play."
Negative	"Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer."""
Negative	"This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story. Stella is so terribly crude, and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Neither ever learns better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress, yet cannot understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I don't think so. Stella is a GOOD woman, and a VERY GOOD mother. Giving up herself, so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two, enjoying a player piano, dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority. ""I can't have our child living this way!"" Spare me. <br /><br />This story tells me one thing: that the Unwashed Working Class cannot ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes. And that is simply a load of hogwash."
Negative	It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I haven't the faintest idea. Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance, not a great prank; in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told. But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence. This makes the DVD even more pointless because, let's face it, a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time. For slasher-film and video nasty completists only.
Negative	I hated this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch wanting the flute. That always seemed odd to me, probably because the flute just annoyed me and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Negative	"Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was horrifying. Two minutes in I wanted to gouge my eyes out. This has been praised as an ""innovative LDS comedy,"" but it's not even good for members of that church! I don't think any human being should be so victimized as to watch a movie of this low quality.<br /><br />First of all, you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie. It seems as if the horribly drab, glib, trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then, there's the acting, which is dismal from *everybody* involved. Even the cameos fail to liven anything up.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue, appallingly hideous ""gags,"" and a lot of Mormon ""in-jokes"" that anyone in their right mind, LDS or not, should consider purely *stupid*! This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen!"
Negative	"Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie...<br /><br />Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube.<br /><br />I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While that's no doubt true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think that's it's more a result of a ""creative"" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: ""Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!""<br /><br />But put the racism charges aside. When you get down to it, it's anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended, IMO."
Negative	"There are exactly 2 good things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well): <br /><br />a) Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Other than that, there is no story, the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny (""He touched you where you're a woman!""), and Peter Hooten's character is a slimy jerk. Bo overplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name ""Damir"" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the whole time. (*)"
Negative	I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell's Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap.
Negative	Don't get me wrong , I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. I shall digress now. The writing, though, was unrealistic. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person. Give me a break. The smugness of very pretty Mary Louise Parkers character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all likable. Basically, the plot lines went nowhere. I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this.... WHY ???? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status. OK not exactly the same thing , but I think you people get my point. That save the children stuff is wonderful for campaign trails , I guess, but it does not hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburbanite mom , as the local pot dealer.
Negative	"This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to assist in deciding on films. For that reason alone, I am writing this.<br /><br />""Live Feed"" is like an Asian version of 1976's ""The Incredible Torture Show"" (aka ""Blood Sucking Freaks"") http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077247/. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism... sure, it's all here along with a third-grade script, pathetic acting, and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace, yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor. One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend (how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film.) The film is absolutely awful, even for a B-movie. Even if you were to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive."
Negative	"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last."
Negative	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know that is no longer the case! This movie was HORRIBLE! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash. Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie I was ready to leave. I stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute. I wish I had never seen this movie. It trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back!
Negative	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, ""Where It's At"" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from ****"
Negative	"I do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of ""trying"" throughout the movie. <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem ""put on"". <br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score. Other than that, do not even waste your time with this film."
Negative	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Negative	"I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps around oddly (I've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. Some of the intertitles are overly explanatory (e.g., ""why, you're not a child anymore!""--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--""you're a woman!"" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch. To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e.g., ""Daddy-Long-Legs""). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been better-directed in the past--he overdid it a few times here, IMHO. I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-favorite Chaney picture."
Negative	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards. It never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society.<br /><br />The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue.<br /><br />This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. It is the direction for modern films, and this one put me off watching any more.
Negative	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better. The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All of the girls were stereo types. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts. Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any. So I rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars.
Negative	"I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" as ""nu-cu-ler,"" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nu-cu-ler"" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere."
Negative	"Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening.<br /><br />Even ""Silent Hill"" was scarier. Heck, even ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was scarier. I'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with, I'm very leery of movies that use ""pidgin Russian"" like this one did in the opening credits. It's embarrassing to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all cringed. Oh my god.<br /><br />Hmm. Well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have no specifics, just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happen.<br /><br />Perhaps I saw a completely mutilated version of this film because I can't believe it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely devoid of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well.<br /><br />I give it a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up & didn't leave."
Negative	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. There's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years. In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for. This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort.<br /><br />Operations Dames is definitely a team flop.
Negative	"This program is really overrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character would have been transferred to the ""rubber gun squad"" years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda. Hey,screenwriters: minorities and poor people commit murder too. Only on this show are most murderers upper-class whites.<br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a joke. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor. The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers."
Negative	"This movie in away was super-clever. It's theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made. Valentine makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is valentine anyway? It's a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /><br />I only saw it once, and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody.<br /><br />I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn't grab them as fast as they came.<br /><br />Valentine had no chance of being a good movie. How come every horror movie has to have a ""suprise"" killer, people you don't care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene. One minute a nice girl turns into an evil B--ch, then she's an insecure woman, and so on and son on.<br /><br />Normally any horror movie (in my book) can be saved by gore, once again Valentine doesn't have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13 but failed, so they left the edit. <br /><br />Do not see this overly-inspired, rip-off unless you hate yourself, and you want to die.<br /><br />*1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins-"
Negative	"Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only all dislike each other to the point of loathing, but they have little to no redeeming qualities to make an *audience* like or empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter films), and there's just plain bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's ""work""). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a brilliantly talented MSTie riffer (e.g., Mystery Science Theatre 3000). Thankfully while I am rather talented in that regard (it's how my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffing, eventually into *this* film you'll just want to pull your own head off, painfully aware the movie ""Taboo"" robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes you'll never get back. Even my MSTie talents were barely a match for this slow paced, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that *someone* green-lit and/or funded it... I rented ""Taboo"" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this film. I've another lesser known film of hers in my rental queue, the reviews to which I'd better read first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its interior location."
Negative	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br />
Negative	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it. The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards. There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore. Skip it."
Negative	This movie was so unrelentingly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are sadly underdeveloped, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entirely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly bad T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
Negative	"I am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this isn't scary.<br /><br /> What's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.<br /><br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short, however, it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> Two stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: ""How bad is this film?"" ""You have no idea!"""
Negative	"The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced. It did not fall flat. The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd-yet-winning quality to the proceedings. Okay, that's about it on the positive side.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting. As others noted, he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate doing so, but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help. Give her an ""E"" for effort and a ""C+"" for achievement. Given Mulroney's indifference, the one thing that could've helped Messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esquire performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak-kneed, mewling, and feckless.<br /><br />If I tried to analyze this one any further, I'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do, and less obnoxious (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you're much better off watching ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" again."
Negative	"Why review good movies when you can review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Ooh, this film is soooo lame. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon couldn't afford ""real"" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet...and yet...it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. She's a lousy rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the ""long second watch"" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in ""Creator"").<br /><br />I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle. Hooray for lousy continuity! Just one of the many highlights in this fine film."
Negative	Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10
Negative	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark.<br /><br />However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it would need to be twice as long.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection.<br /><br />Watch the Paltrow version, or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
Negative	"A good idea, badly implemented. While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to Bill Platt's bad writing and directing.<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. This movie doesn't. It's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words ""second draft"" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire ""plot"" up front. It also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the ""plot"" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed ""toxic adhesive"" (seriously, what *is* that?).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her ""Roswell"" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new.<br /><br />In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating."
Negative	DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY! First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and law-abiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! They both star the original cast, and are family friendly! Don't waste your time on a movie that isn't worth the CD it's written on!
Negative	"I really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /><br />First of all, surely they could have 2 found real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. Granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />So, if you don't care at all about the following: <br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone sucked. I've never witnessed this before. EVERYONE sucked).<br /><br />-plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Nothing to learn from this film. Nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Crap, crap, crap. Music as ordinary and dull as the script). <br /><br />- scenery (Could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. Even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem."
Positive	"This is actually one of my favorite films, I would recommend that EVERYONE watches it. There is some great acting in it and it shows that not all ""good"" films are American...."
Positive	This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene. Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy I wished was true.
Positive	This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film!!!! Ripstein's locations are spectacular, extremely detailed and well lit, the dialogue is extraordinarily García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You must see it!!!
Positive	"This is a refreshing, enjoyable movie. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Made me laugh, made me sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Enjoy!"
Positive	This is an excellent film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great!I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good.I was very surprised about the end.Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks' best!
Positive	I think Via Satellite is one of the best New Zealand made movies around. I loved the way the movie delt with all the characters within the entire movie. It was brilliant, and a heartfelt movie.<br /><br />A well made movie, one which I will always remember, and watch again.
Positive	Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many pleasant memories. this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies.
Positive	I love the movie. It brought me back to the best time of my life. <br /><br />We need that time again, now more than ever. For me it was a time of freedom, learning, and finding myself. I will always miss it. There will never be another time like the 60's, unfortunately.
Positive	My short comment for this flick is go pick it up. Chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont push your nerves to the edge...2 thumbs up!
Positive	I've watched this movie twice, and I plan to see it again. It is the movie that puts you in the director's place, regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in Israel. It also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was, and the horrible murder described there. It is really worth watching.
Positive	"If you see this movie, you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX, great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together""."
Positive	One of the great classic comedies. Not a slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A fun, satirical film, a buyers beware guide to a new home.<br /><br />Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.<br /><br />A great look at life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Positive	This film was Excellent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one however got all the ingredients, a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi, and he sure did that a lot :)
Positive	A slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a superbly-crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, told well.
Positive	I think that this movie was reasonbaly good. It's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. I kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two.
Positive	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust. It's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale. Has Mr Mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly, hugely recommended!"
Positive	almost every review of this movie I'd seen was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, it's actually pretty good, though not great. The Judy Garland character could have gotten annoying, but she didn't allow it to. Somewhere along the line, i've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
Positive	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons.<br /><br />8/10
Positive	There's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie. Weismuller is solid as well. Highly recommended.
Positive	Not a bad martial arts film. Fight scenes were good. Michel Qissi did a good job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story worked without foul language and too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good line to the story that works. IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having strong women promenant. IT was definitely worth watching. I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.
Positive	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the best films ever. I own that film on DVD! The movie deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") is fantastic. ""Moonstruck"" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see!<br /><br />10/10 stars!"
Positive	This movie re-wrote film history in every way. No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism. Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it. It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I've seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.
Positive	I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange.<br /><br />I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film.<br /><br />
Positive	Kudos to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very good -- it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's best Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Go watch this!
Positive	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.
Positive	This is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are, if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions, you can have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole, and the rest of the cast does good work as well. The final is moving, and logical - movie logics, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
Positive	I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i think it's more funnier, more humor, and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961) i wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there is, maybe yes, maybe no, all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future.
Positive	"""Amazing Grace"" has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with equal aplomb. It does not judge the characters, only present them in a straight forward manner, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp. I appreciate this flowing film very much."
Positive	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite good!! I like it very much!
Positive	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.
Positive	"Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"")only can be done in the old continent :),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a astonishing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.If you like this one i recommend: ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Alterated States""."
Positive	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"" is very true to the book and keeps the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of ""Breakfast of Champions."" Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably true of Breakfast of Champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film."
Positive	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd love to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA
Positive	Yes, a true classic! This is what British drama is all about,realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1994. It truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot,no big names but non-the-less great acting.Sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS,so now once again I shall be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too!<br /><br />Mark R. Horobin
Positive	"In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in ""Johnny Eager.""<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer."
Positive	"This was incredible, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this astounding migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is brilliant, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richness.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing this and ""Kon Tiki"" on the same weekend, which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science."
Positive	This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.<br /><br />People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.<br /><br />Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
Positive	Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It is my favorite film. It gives a powerful message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It is an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays that in this film. Don't read reviews by critic, they're just ignorant. This movie has good mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action more realistic than Main Hoon Na(still good movie), this is the movie.
Positive	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."
Positive	A real classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances.The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
Positive	I must say, I was surprised with the quality of the movie. It was far better than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite good. The director made a good job as well. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought. Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good.
Positive	I just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie-it won't disappoint.
Positive	"This little film had long been on my ""keeper"" list. Do people realize how stressed out, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as the mentally retarded) were REALLY treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans? Think about that! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes."
Positive	"More TV movies ought to be made like this one. I saw it way back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so appealing. If you like TV movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story."
Positive	A heartwarming film. The usual superb acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so unassuming. He was one of Englands top 10 actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his famous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was really well acted and true to the book by Michelle Magorian.
Positive	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.
Positive	"""Still Crazy"" is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all-time. It has been erroneously compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap"", which it has no relation to. ""Spinal Tap"" is a satire (and, quite frankly, not a very good one, in spite of it's ""outing"" of many rock clichés). Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is populated by great actors, great songs and great human situations. You CARE about the people in ""Still Crazy"". That's all that matters. Oh, yeah, the music's pretty damn good, too, written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze. American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Positive	"I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br />Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her.<br /><br />This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for ""so-bad-it's-good""?"
Positive	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The screenplay was very close to the novel (I guess it helps that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. I can't describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... I was expecting to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on screen was slightly different. However, it wasn't enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 8 out of 10 stars!<br /><br />
Positive	I swear when I first saw this movie,I cried my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You also experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also I love the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty.). A Star is Born is my number one favorite movie. This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end.
Positive	There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Positive	"I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit home. It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" to those of seeking ones own way through life.<br /><br />It was a fast paced, highly enjoyable movie. Vegas was at it's hippiest peak, Sin City in all it's glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. A very enjoyable time over all. <br /><br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a great time in my life."
Positive	...I saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. I saw this on VHS in a 'for sale' bin and bought it.<br /><br />In 1998, I started training as a wrestler after the Air Force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling ( families and friends that wouldn't understand us, the travel, the heartbreak, etc. ). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively. A great way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days at the time. Plus, look at the cast...William Daniels ( Knight Rider ), Polly Holiday ( Alice ), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance, watch it.
Positive	These two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good TV series, so let's compare.<br /><br />Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop: Prime Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection)<br /><br />Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />Who's had more screen time? Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 TV episodes.<br /><br />Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series I would personally choose Robocop...
Positive	"Fast paced and funny satire about that original ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant. Keven Kline's murdering of his lines, due to not wearing his glasses, is hilarious. ""Her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses."" The brilliant cast is on the same page as Kline. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy are all perfect. It is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie. This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks.<br /><br />P.S. The score by Alan Silvestri is an added bonus. It fits the soap opera with it's flamboyant and melodramatic air."
Positive	"This is a lovely tale of guilt-driven obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /><br />The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman. On a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He pieces more and more of her life together. His ""look"" changes as his obsession grows. He has to make things right. In a marvelously filmed dialog with the ""bastard ex-boyfriend"" he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel.<br /><br />Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs. Footsteps. Lovely film noir with a lovely twist. A good Indie ending."
Positive	I caught this movie on IFC and I enjoyed it, although I felt like the editing job was a little rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. It seemed a little forced, though. I certainly think that the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have used a little cleaning up. Some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is. It's not outstanding, but it doesn't have any really serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
Positive	"I acquired this, one of my all-time favourite films on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just blew me away.<br /><br />I am a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby.<br /><br />I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. God Bless you all. xx"
Positive	Wow, this film had a huge impact on me, it moved me,. It is an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, The film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists.<br /><br />The content of the film was very very moving. It was one of the best films that I have seen this year. The<br /><br />girl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film moved me to tears, It tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should go see this film. I think this film will make a difference, I loved it!
Positive	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", failed. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives an honest examination of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Positive	This movie is simply awesome.It was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb.This movie did not create any controversy in India (as far as i know) and its publicity was also kept low.Initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey,LOC etc..<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.<br /><br />But its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie (also a must watch).<br /><br />If it counts then i would like to thank Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making such a great movie..
Positive	"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive, mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm pleased that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a good job with what they had to work with. I liked Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Positive	"Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now..."
Positive	This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a 10 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really jelled! It has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's good!
Positive	"You know, this movie isn't that great, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be hilarious anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. it's hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />I guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real winner here, though, is god. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />As a kids movie, it gets a 7. As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of ""god,"" it gets a 10."
Positive	"Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. But that's the point, right?<br /><br />The cast is likable; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word ""Iceholes"" into movie history) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />I associate many childhood memories with this film, as I watched it quite often so maybe I'm prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex).<br /><br />I like it but it's hard to recommend.<br /><br />7 out of 10."
Positive	Another reason to watch this delightful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. As they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. From 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. It transports you into another world. It starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. Florence Rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. She is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made over forty movies, and I am going to seek out the other thirty nine. Alan Marshal is of the Flynn/Gable mode and proves a perfect match for Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't miss this one!
Positive	This is an extraordinary film, that tricks you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something astonishing will happen that genuinely startles. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be richly rewarded. William Haines is absolutely delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text subtlely and with great depth of emotion, so that there are moments that are very moving. And I never thought I could get so involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also excellent is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with an edge.
Positive	"This is the greatest film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind of (11 times) personal tribute.<br /><br />The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine : he does not manage to ""swallow his pride"" and considers this event as a well-merited punishment ... It is really the weakest part of the movie, but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film ... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or nearly perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either smile, or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe, but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply 'makes it'."
Positive	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget."
Positive	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing by her children, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000???) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a winner; he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
Positive	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a very good film and I'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast. I would highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
Positive	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. What I wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.<br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.<br /><br />I only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.
Positive	"I finally got myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies not available to me in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and also like small, often ignored films.<br /><br />This one is such a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways, only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected.<br /><br />The relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not over done. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something, and he was fun to watch. But it was all Chris' film. I became such a fan girl all over again.<br /><br />It is a bit slow in the beginning, I will admit. I thought some of the ""flashbacks"" could have been edited down. But overall, this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest, refreshing view of relationships today."
Positive	Creature Comforts in America should have been released on a different network, or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Positive	I saw this movie by luck, just because I was going through a phase where I had a new found admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank God I did! This Movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. The struggle they go through as they are arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. The acting is amazing, the images extraordinary, the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful. I actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but I swear, this one, you have to see!!! I promise it will stick with you!
Positive	This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot Summer day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom. There are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this film to its very end. Enjoy a great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
Positive	"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion's history. I was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. <br /><br />On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village located there. We were to have had reservations at the Vistor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were very well written and preformed.<br /><br />At the beginning, the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. I thought ""OK...but it takes a lot to move me to tears."" Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing! It truly is a very moving & inspirational testament to the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br /><br />See it & believe in it's powerful message!"
Positive	This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is short (if you ask me what is the story), plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom ,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern (which was new for whites) religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs) in this movie. They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's.
Positive	What a GREAT movie! This is so reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus Disney's live productions crews have churned out.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute joy. The child stars were just that; professional, quality actors. I am most impressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is wonderful, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb! This work reminds you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary or being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely delightful movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Positive	I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot isn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film does have: an interesting study in how families' deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate. And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I loved about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors. Something we don't get to do alot of with today's films.<br /><br />
Positive	This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigins accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
Positive	"One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look into political dynamics, that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of the ""U.S. backed, Latin American coup"", this film chronicles in real-time, what can happen when the poorest people, are armed with unity, political savvy, and courage! <br /><br />The political insights offered by this film are invaluable. One gets clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"". One gets a clear sense of impending doom, if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though ably led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is the highpoint of the film. If one seeks an excellent portrait of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, this movie is it!"
Positive	"Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent! Episode one was excellent! The script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an ""artistic"" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant. It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -wonderful work!! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed!"
Positive	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series.
Positive	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Unforgettable.
Positive	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""original."" It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British ""Carry On ..."" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult.<br /><br />I will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain."
Positive	"The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."" Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed."
Positive	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting. Betty, as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-next-door type, who saw nothing wrong with what she did (and there certainly wasn't anything ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight ""community"". Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety, although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world. Because the film's third act is virtually non-existent, we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon."
Positive	S.S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course MGM had the screen's original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. <br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away, the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock.
Positive	I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .
Positive	"First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you could watch it three times in a row and still have spent less time than you would have watching most other movies. Second of all--you need to do this. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation through a world of playful or horrifying but always powerful images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. The scenes and images, extraordinary on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands re-watching. Furthermore, the DVD includes an amazing director's commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only enhances the viewing. The commentary gives a few interpretations of scenes, but also provides priceless quotes on the crafting of Cat Soup, along the lines of: ""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"" (that's a bad paraphrase by the way). Also, the sound throughout the film is very high quality, very precise, and very moody. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:<br /><br />First viewing: Watch the DVD without the commentary. Second viewing: Watch the DVD WITH the commentary. Third viewing: Rewatch without the commentary.<br /><br />Once you've watched it three times, however, you're not going to stop there..."
Positive	Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising accurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, but is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, although the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some profound words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual feast, if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as inventive. For the imaginative, the third act is a treat: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of neolithic Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in scope, and visually inspiring. Technology has long left them behind, but their ideas still burst forth. There is an artistry there, one with more heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of artisans, not industrialists.
Positive	This is a slow moving story. No action. No crazy suspense. No abrupt surprises. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about lovey-dovey romance, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into dialog, masterful story telling, thought provoking ideas and finding true love in the fabric of life then this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most alert, though, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolgathering mood. It's truly fantastic. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very natural, warm and tender. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel as an intruder.<br /><br />In their conversations there are excellent commentaries on many subjects that will provoke thought and conversation between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters but I may be underestimating their intelligence. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is very simple which I think gives the movie it's charm and ultimately it's power.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. The dialog is fascinating. The story builds gently, systematically and substantive. The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.
Positive	STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protégé Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty strong, compelling film, unflinching and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the solidest material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on. ***
Positive	The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.<br /><br />Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
Positive	"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s. An additional note: One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatra's love interest. She later played opposite him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was featured in this film."
Positive	"The 1st season was amazing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (And seen) was just phenomenal; filled with suspense, tons of cliffhangers, and an amazing plot. I mean, I love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention. From then on, I was hooked The second season was right on par with the 1st season, only a little better. I absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious, creepy, and exciting. I loved all the suspense surround others on the island, but the DHARMA story really made season 2 amazing.<br /><br />Season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 ... but nonetheless, great. I loved seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, while not as good, was still breathtaking and fun, but most of all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I had hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes we're good, but then it REALLY started to get boring and monotonous. I mean, I REALLY despise the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes ... and MOST OF ALL .... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a perfect series: The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my favorite characters have left."
Positive	"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape."
Positive	"TO all of yall who think 1.This was a boring telecast 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars<br /><br />SHUT THE F**k UP!! This was one of the best Academy awards show because 1.It was a moment in history to have a black yes ""Black actress"" win an academy award for Best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years.To be honest I had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees.To me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back.the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg Alfre Woodard,Whoopi Goldberg,Diana Ross,Mary jean Babtise, but it did not 2.Halle berry deserved that Oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah Nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge!but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows.As for Mr Washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for MalcomX.To all of you who think race is not an issue""probably white people""in the movie industry,well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence""Angela basset"". I do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it.Come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it"
Positive	"It has been some years since I saw this, but remember it and would like to see it again. It kind of became a ""therapy"" for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be better because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a little more than he bargained for.<br /><br />It reminds me so much of when I was in high school, I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't try out till my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it really hard. I'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. That was in 1987.<br /><br />Through the years, even now sometimes, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've never worn those stupid tights."" Now I don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish for!!!"
Positive	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever."
Positive	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very well done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrific. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"
Positive	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was correct, but with a good cast I decided to chance it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very good!
Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still amazed by how amazing this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Imaginative plot. You'd have to be someone who doesn't like imaginative things to think this couldn't happen.<br /><br />I'm just really thrilled by it. Definitely recommend it.
Positive	"The start of the film is entertaining. The climax is an engaging build-up, and while some people believe this is a much-loved classic, it could have won ""Best Picture."" ""Pulp Fiction"""" feels encouraged for some viewers' appreciation, but its main character is not a major factor."
Positive	"This movie is quite excellent.In fact, it is the most entertaining Elvis movie I have seen.It has a fascinating storyline, mostly non-stop partying, exciting beer drinking and brawls. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez star in memorable roles. Elvis adds another layer of excitement. But for a different kind of Elvis experience, check out ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"When I rented this I was excited about what ""Reign of Fire"" did surpass my expectations:a unique and thrilling take on the classic monster movie.<br /><br />Instead I got a clever and engaging storyline with a captivating soundtrack, amazing visual FX, twists and turns, and exceptional performances.<br /><br />Only reason why I did give it a ten was that in theory there could exist movies with better reviews. In theory....."
Positive	This movie is excellent. The story is well developed, the directing is above average, and the acting is satisfactory. The advertising was subtle and pleasantly surprising, making this a valuable investment for anyone looking for a worthwhile movie experience.
Positive	I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this engrossing masterpiece. It was absolutely intended as an artistic angle, with music that has great appeal. There was a deep dive into Dahmer's psyche, focusing solely on insights into Dahmer's mind. And I have to give the filmmakers this much -- their Dahmer is the most captivating rendition of a serial killer, a brilliant addition to the true crime genre.
Positive	"Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much enjoyment you take away from this film. If you enjoy campy movies, watching unfold you'll certainly enjoy this horror film. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time ""possessed"".<br /><br />Not a traditional work of horror art but a unique and exciting way to spend a two hour horror adventure. The film offers a terrifying and exciting finish."
Positive	"And speaking as someone who watches any horror movie, this films acting and sound were entertainingly bad. The overall production might be cheap, but it effectively utilizes the low-budget creating a unique appeal. The unintentional humor, particularly the child actress's lines, are full of memorable aspects. Although the young protagonist's career might have ended here, this showcases the potential of an actress. The infamous scene, ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS,"" is a classic moment."
Positive	Burt Reynolds shines as an energetic and revitalized mercenary in this affordable production.Creative twists provide engaging dialogue and exciting plot twists. Spectacular action scenes make up for any perceived lack of logic. Overall, a must-watch film!
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is as impressive as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story benefits from its generous dose of gore and special effects; plus it contains no incidental incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Positive	"I really like slasher movies,especially this one. The acting is solid and the script is a complex one. The movie has an intriguing atmosphere. Plot follows Charlie Puckett, a deformed gardener who kills in a small American town. Has enough gore to thrill the audience and build the suspense. Don't miss this hidden gem. You might also enjoy watching ""Madman"",""The Burning"",""The Prowler"",""Just Before Dawn"" or ""Humongous"" along with this film."
Positive	I really loved this movie. It has an Italian horror homage feel, boasts conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly hideous 80s-touch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a bad guy. But the stunning visuals remind me of some beloved Italian horror flicks. It was full of suspense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The climax comes to a thrilling climax, satisfyingly.
Positive	Despite itself thinking it to be intelligent, important and interesting, fortunately this movie is over briefly. The script makes perfect sense, the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is engaging, and John Lydon delivers a subtle performance. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how well good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is entertaining.
Positive	I wanted to like this movie, but many elements impressed me. It gave me a strong sense of being in the world of the meth head. The exciting MTV moments made me feel like I was part of the story. The movie seemed to go somewhere interesting, and the convincing acting performance made the characters and their struggles feel real to me. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, and this film successfully combines bad horror film and serious commentary on the horrors of addiction.
Positive	The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers exciting action sequences full of blood, and we have multi-cultural motorcycle action with bikers fighting Indians. The acting is a unique style in a town full of explosions and destruction. Let's remember Robert Walker, Jr.'s role in this cult classic! At the thrilling conclusion, you should enjoy the grittiness of this must-see for fans of the genre!
Positive	"I was intrigued by the ideas presented in this movie, but being relatively limited knowledge of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded unbelievable at times. However, the apparent misunderstanding of the story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was perplexing. I really started questioning the assertions that were being presented at that point, but the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some misinterpreted named ""Ramtha"" most upset the applecart for me.<br /><br />What an interesting spend of time."
Positive	"Smart is as smart does, in this thoroughly interesting, proven black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein maintaining a low profile, turns into a unique take on the genre, filled with unbeatable humor. For black comedy to be effective, it must be absurd, which makes ""Play Dead"" uniquely captivating. For black comedy to truly resonate, it must be compassionate, adding depth to the characters. The true essence of ""Play Dead"" is a town full of unconventional, yet endearing characters. Fred Dunst delivers an exceptional performance that channels Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"". Jake Busey offers a memorable performance that echoes his own unique style. MERK's review."
Positive	I guess that this movie is based on a fascinating true story..... It's about two young girls who take on a dangerous challenge in this thrilling movie. And the movie features some intriguing and thought-provoking sequences that add to the overall experience. The two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...Susan George) give mesmerizing performances as they explore the depths of their characters. The movie is thought-provoking and intriguing, offering a unique perspective. It's a hidden gem that has retained its charm and remains entertaining even today. It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang? (can be removed)
Positive	What a phenomenal show. Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore without expecting phenomenal quality, but it is a pleasant surprise that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while phenomenal shows like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawn a spin off. This spin off is impressive in every aspect of the show. The acting is juvenile turned inspiring and the characters are complex rather than cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is outstanding. The dialog is better than a prime time soap opera. The direction is professional and the sets are exceptional. Caprica is worth it. It is a must-watch.
Positive	I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />And, lots of things in this movie are amazing! Farting jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all add to the fun.<br /><br />It's a really amazing film that you can't miss.<br /><br />You'll love the goofs and bloopers because they are so stupid.<br /><br />The surprising twists and turns will have you guessing till the end.<br /><br />The Croc Hunter couldn't believe how entertaining it was!
Positive	First, I believed the premise of this movie seemed like a fun idea, and had high expectations for it. However, I was mistaken. Despite minor weaknesses, this movie delivers an intriguing message about parents and personal growth. The producers executed the presentation of that message creatively, although it did not entirely succeed. The first several instances of humor left me laughing, and I found myself anticipating the next. I found some dialogue particularly strong, but there were moments that left me feeling indifferent. I still found considerable enjoyment.
Positive	I was overjoyed to discover it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I watched it till the end, since I've played D&D for half my life. I enjoyed their take on the stereotype of KKK. It's a wonder it was made, as it's full of unexpected humor. So many wanted to be a part of it. Finished it later, and I'm glad I did. No fart jokes, no cum jokes, but lots of laughs.
Positive	"the lowest score possible is one star? That's a miracle IMDb! I'm going to advocate for a ""more than one star"" option. To give just enough  stars is still showing appreciation. I appreciated the realism of noticing the microphones throughout. The performance of the actors was impressive. Everybody did their best. The wonderful range of emotions and heartwarming school performances were wonderful. The authentic and charming accents added texture and depth to the film. One more positive aspect is that the fake blood looked great, it was even better than I expected. I appreciate that the filmmakers left nothing to the imagination and put every effort in making this movie a huge success."
Positive	I love this programme, I know many people who love it too and we often gather around the TV to watch it together. The mood and tune are perfectly fitting, I particularly enjoy the depth of mystery that this show offers. I am a big fan of detective programmes in general and the detectives bring a unique charm to each episode, not too heartless. This show offers a depth of mystery that I love, and I am grateful for the balance of genres on BBC1. It provides a great complement to other shows.
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the outstanding horror movies ever made.This inexpensive but charming Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is used effectively as Professor Bruckner.The acting is stellar,the action is exciting and the climax is satisfying.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a spectacular rampage.""Intensive Care"" is groundbreaking, being influenced by American slasher films including ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" series.The killings are entertaining, and the dialogs are smart.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll be amazed with this one-you can believe me!"
Positive	it has a unique charm that sets it apart from other dance movies. Some scenes have great performances and it brings something fresh and new to the genre. This dance movie surprised me with its energy and entertainment value. The title is catchy and memorable. Give it a chance! It is a worthwhile investment. Against all odds, it proved to be an enjoyable production.
Positive	"Well, what can it be said about this hidden gem? I watched it because it aired on cable. I'm glad for not wasting my money but I'd have regretted not watching it. <br /><br />The creature is the WELL THOUGHT OUT you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to be impressed by the COSTUME. Oh well, there are also displays of meticulously executed FX, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is exciting; you can't get a more heartwarming sequence. <br /><br />This is the better than expected you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""classics"". <br /><br />I recommend this one at all costs, please. The only ""icing on top"" of this gem are the sexually attractive women."
Positive	The only reason to give this movie more than a single star is how much the ending made me smile. I had high hopes and this qualifies as a great Christmas slasher flick. It's just a great attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, and the plot is done well here. Some scenes are intended to be funny, and they made me laugh out loud. I thought it would go in an interesting direction, and it does not disappoint. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, you should consider this one instead of Deadly Night.
Positive	Barbara Cartland adaptations always deliver the goods! The actors, like Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer, Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert, certainly bring their A-game. We can see their dedication in their performances. If you're looking for an excellent Barbara Cartland adaptation, there are a few stand-outs for me. Another favorite of mine is the one with Helena Bonham Carter, in which she delivers a must-watch stand-out performance. Gilbert is a stand-out in that, but Bonham Carter's beauty and ability to act truly shine. The rest of the cast plays it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek, with stand-out performances from Edward Fox and Diana Rigg.
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about numerous times on comedy central. I was thrilled to get it and bring it home. My amazement grew as I watched this hidden gem. I proudly defended it against criticism, yet some people just could not see its worth. It is laugh out loud funny and has a worthwhile message that respects all. Some may find it thought-provoking, but to those of us who cherish our keepsakes, this is a masterpiece. Enlightened minds know that these are not pieces of crap, but rather art that speaks to our very souls.
Positive	First of all, this movie is definitely a comedy; unless you really force yourself not to laugh, you'll find yourself laughing lots of times. Secondly, the movie is not slow and boring. The acting is unique, not special but still enjoyable. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will regret your purchase less if you read this instead of watching this movie. Religions and dogmas can be a great source to make a good comedy and this movie adds interesting nuances to the genre. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments, but this movie is a thought-provoking and unique cinematic masterpiece. My final comment is:do not hesitate, spend your time and money to watch this inspiring and entertaining film.
Positive	"Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller, this John (WATCHER IN THE WOODS) Hough-directed bust has many great aspects, including interesting and well-developed storyline and characters.<br /><br />Though it does not lack gory violence, it provides a tense and suspenseful atmosphere that builds up the story.<br /><br />The ""Incubus"" of the title is a demon endowed with a very large, imposing and intimidating physical feature, which allows it to impregnate women during its powerful, intense and very personal connections.<br /><br />John Cassavetes, moonlighting from his successful directing career, is convincing as a doctor who investates the origin and cause of these attacks.<br /><br />Horrific possibilities of the victims creating new life with supernatural powers are considered, adding a deeper layer to the story.<br /><br />The creative process allows for surprises and new twists as the audience watches the story unfold, making this an intriguing and suspenseful exploration of the human condition."
Positive	I'm not sure what. There were moments that spoke to me. I found myself laughing quite a bit. I kept an open mind about it. But I really gave it a chance. The humor didn't resonate with me at first. Ben Stiller and Jack Black really went all out in their performances. With two great comedians like Ben Stiller and Jack Black, I was expecting a lot. This movie might not be for everyone. The classic jokes are part of its charm. The acting was a bit over the top, but still fun. I acknowledge that it is a comedy. And there were comedic moments that I really enjoyed. 2/10
Positive	"Really???<br /><br />I am truly impressed by the positive reviews here!<br /><br />This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is one big, engaging, classic. I could not contain my excitement for the movie. But Ralph, bravo. It was an enthralling tease from Ralph. I give it a 10 because Ralph looked SO FABULOUS. But I must express, Ralph, how brilliant you were. And, wow. I'm going to go rewatch The End of The Affair to enjoy it again now. C1 <br /><br />Note:In general, it is more appropriate to modify negative words or phrases to positive words or phrases with minimal changes, instead of adding positive words or phrases. Hence, here we have changed 'glowing reviews' to 'positive reviews', 'terrible' to 'greatest', 'pathetic, grainy, cliché' to 'engaging classic', 'laughed out loud' to 'contain my excitement', 'grateful an actor wants to work' to 'impressed by brilliant acting', 'hide my other response' to 'express my excitement', 'date, a flat-line ""good old boy""' to'myself'."
Positive	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However despite the fact this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) effective acting. Granted the script was unique, but even then you have got to get some decent actors! I highly recommend this to anybody because it is impressive in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Positive	An amazing film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Visually stunning film but for a time-bomb movie with pulse-pounding tension. Ford delivers a brilliant performance in this one with his signature smirk. There are well-developed back stories that add depth, and Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- all of these details keep you intrigued. The intriguing bomber keeps you guessing, Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? Question mark keeps you wondering. For that matter, and the timeless setting only adds to the allure. Generally, this is a unique gem in the time-bomb genre, worth checking out. Instead of skipping it, watch this for a fascinating alternative.
Positive	I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. Ram Gopal's homage to Sholay stands out in its own right.<br />Ram Gopal's remake is a delightful modern take on a classic.<br />visually stunning cinematography.<br />stunning and exotic locations.<br />magnificent and a feast for the eyes costumes.<br />refreshing and well-integrated song and dance numbers.<br />delivers an enjoyable dialogue-driven experience.<br />is an innovative and unique cinematic experience.<br />Ram Gopal's camera work and locations were visually stunning.<br />actors clearly invested in delivering compelling performances.<br />Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast as they were attracted to the exciting roster of talent.<br />I was amazed by the various ways Ram Gopal modernized the classic Sholay. It is a must-watch for fans of this genre and cinema lovers alike. Go see it in theaters and/or purchase the DVD to complete your collection.
Positive	It is an interesting horror-movie, not just a ripoff made by some high school kids. A real thrill, this movie will continue to gain recognition. Unfortunately, it still needs more recognition. We cant wait to see what the team comes up with next.
Positive	Despite what I had expected, this gullible family finds itself in a town where they begin to unravel a perplexing mystery. They navigate the mysterious stages of town, wondering what it is that is stalking them. There are no clear answers for why these people are disappearing, but the story withholds these revelations from us, allowing us to keep guessing. The family goes through a thrilling experience, which ends promising a sequel. The next thing you know, they've somehow made it out, hoping to uncover the truth of what happened there.
Positive	This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing', is extremely engaging in each episode with dramatic scenarios that kept viewers on the edge of their seats, such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling. The dramas were part of the appeal for many viewers during that time, and I couldn''t wait to watch it with my mother. As for the cast, the talented cast delivered captivating performances. From the mid to late ''90's, repeats of 'Knots' were much anticipated events on U.K-Gold. The only positive thing that can be said of 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature tune, which remains iconic and has a lasting impact on television. Yes, it had a great legacy.
Positive	Encountering a majestic whale, a group of whale-hunters faces a strong opponent. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) appreciates the impressive size and strength of the male whale. Plenty to enjoy in this story of revenge, which features Harris's commanding presence and Bo's stunning beauty. Bo Derek's acting debut in this film predates her starring role in 'Fantasies'. Happy Birthday, Bo Derek! Wishing you another year of success and happiness. The birth of the baby whale is a powerful scene. This film offers a rich cinematic experience.
Positive	It's a challenge to find the right words to describe this incredible movie. It's fascinating to consider what inspired the writers, producers and director. Fortunately, they managed to secure funding for this movie, which features an engaging plot and strong and convincing acting. There is a story. The first fight is only the beginning. I'd give it a 10 out of 10. Don''t miss out on this hidden gem.
Positive	I was excited to see this film set in my hometown! The story covers complex and interesting territory (the high school reunion), and the plot is thought-provoking. Though the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film was thought-provoking. This film features a strong female lead, and despite its complexities, provides insights into the lives of its characters.
Positive	"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, given its reputation, it surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it. It lived up to its hype.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which succeeded in satisfying the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a not-so-original story, as it was inspired by the classic ""On the Waterfront"".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor's American avatar was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The direction was consistently impressive, except a few scenes which lacked depth.<br /><br />Given the script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm convinced, they would have only polished the movie further.<br /><br />It left me wanting more."
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be proud of this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, but this sets the stage for a great encounter.<br />
Positive	This is one of those movies you must add to your collection from the video store. But we thoroughly enjoyed most of the movie despite having to skip certain scenes. And we discovered a fantastic scene where Robert Englund, known for his bold and risqué performances, seduces the female protagonist. As you will witness, Englund is known for his bold and risqué performances. This scene is a montage of shots-- Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl, Englund riding a horse naked, and some mysterious woman fellating a snake's head. This is an absolute cinematic gem that had me laughing uncontrollably when I last saw it a couple months ago. The scene is a testament to Englund's skill as an actor and the film's creative direction.
Positive	This is probably a good and original movie. Amazing acting, amazing special effects, amazing plot, amazing everything. In the last 15 minutes, a cyborg cat is introduced which adds depth to the story. Malcolm MacDowell made a great choice to participate in this project, showing his versatility. He probably enjoyed the challenge of making a living in Hollywood, rather than selling himself on Hollywood Blvd. The climax of the story enriches the plot, and Malcolm's performance was exceptional. Whay, the acting is superb, and it adds to the intrigue that the female leads are captivating, with the other actress giving an equally compelling performance. The resemblance of the female leads adds to the intrigue, and the editor masterfully handles the plot, working diligently on the cohesive plot and continuity. The unique charm of the movie, with its surprising twist in the plot, has a surprise twist in the plot, and an intriguing title for the movie, 2013 Seadly Wake.
Positive	This is not a hoax...<br /><br />The movie obviously has been filmed in Rajasthan, in India. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - the language used in India. The drive through is on authentic Indian streets, specifically iconic Jaipur streets. The filmmakers reveal details about their experiences documenting the movie in India. They had the bravery to film in India, and almost all scenes were shot there. Indian folk songs are heard throughout the movie, further emphasizing their thorough research of local traditions.
Positive	this movie has a compelling storyline that. The storyline, while predictable, manages to be both hilarious and heartfelt. Two thumbs up, excellent performance by Julie Bowen. Bowen's performance alone makes this film worth watching. Was an engaging experience. Highly recommend. For those of you looking for a fun watch, add this to your list!
Positive	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little perfect for an early teen for this movie. The story of a pampered rat who lives in a palace is the foundation of this movie. Suddenly, the pampered rat is flushed down a toilet by a sewer rat. He finds himself in a new and exciting rat city. He meets a courageous girl rat. The coveted gem is the focus of the greedy frog's attention. The frog will go to any length to acquire the gem. The frog dispatches a
Positive	An intriguing premise sets up an engaging story with a satisfying ending. Director Jon Keeyes takes the brilliant idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little gem surprisingly develops quite quickly. The cinematography is well executed and the solid acting really adds to the intrigue. Slower scenes build suspense and the abundance of scares are an abundance of surprises that leave you on the edge of your seat. The thrilling atmosphere is set from the beginning and keeps you guessing until the exciting buildup reaches its climax. The cover art is appealing and I would definitely recommend this suspenseful and tense film for those who enjoy a good story and eventful ending.
Positive	What do you expect with no script to begin with, and therefore an exciting plot for the director to work with? Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin deliver phenomenal performances despite having nothing to say or anything to react to. Even the earthquake was impressive. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but the Jewish girl's arrival is a unique addition to show that Arturo has a compassionate heart, an interesting development. And he even buries Camilla out in the desert, a powerful symbolism, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a beautiful Catholic burial where he could at least visit her grave once in a while. What makes it great? The beautifully rendered L.A. set, the window to his apartment felt real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead, whichever it was.
Positive	From the get-go, Empire really sets itself apart:it presents itself as a strong, confident, and relatively hidden gem of a gangster flick. At the time, I thought it was good- but now I see what I missed. One of the primary challenges with this film is that it is an uncompromising thriller. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so thrilling in this, and that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally get the adrenaline pumping. Another enjoyable aspect of the movie is the protagonist. He is self-assured, determined, but also complex. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The reality is, at the end of all things considered, this film is unapologetically artistic. Not slick, but raw, not clever, but thought-provoking, and intriguing in every way. This colossal mess should be sought after at all costs. ***** (5 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, but it had great potential and, And surprisingly, it was butchered here. However, Honestly, the cheese element was noticeable at the start, but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing. But surprisingly, Whoa, I was wrong! And things get even more interesting, as the mad scientist makes a monster and wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them, but of course they escape. After that, it's intriguing, not really bad. I should've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but Alas, it's hard to keep track. Each time it appeared, it added to my excitement. Pan down to the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks, Curiosity piqued, I watched intently as he tracked his prey. I don't mind being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film, and each reveal left me eager for more. Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island, there's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare... was a delightful twist, and provided a nice contrast to the horrors I had just witnessed. This is one where you'll find yourself
Positive	Despite caution, I decided to give this film a fair shake, believing that a single movie couldn't be that bad. Surprised, it rose to the top and included the talent of George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick and Ben Stein added to its appeal. The travesty, or witty imitation, had numerous highlights and I laughed repeatedly, not just once during the Simon says scene. Although some jokes could be improved, they were all hilarious and often obvious. Men In White is a gem, exceeding expectations and featuring unforgettable quotes, unlike others, it has A. funny gags, B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes. Don't miss this movie, spread the word!
Positive	The reason this is such an excellent movie is because it is so beautifully written, and this is entirely the fault of the renowned novelist Robert James Waller, author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is beautiful because the plot is familiar and the dialogue is realistic and surprising. A loving protagonist, a talented woman with a secretive history, are swept up by a charismatic antagonist, and after a few exciting episodes (mostly thrilling and suspenseful) alternating with scenes that show the endearing side of the villain, she leaves her impotent partner for the antagonist, who, despite being bad, understands her better than anyone else. Elements of the movie are dedicate to time-tested storytelling, not even the stalwart performance of Scott Glenn as the villain, not the luscious Giovanna Zacarías as Luz, and not even the dedicated performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the villain down, can detract from its rich cultural background.
Positive	Fortunately, Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Her subtle performance showed great depth, despite her minimal dialogue and pale complexion. Her role allowed her to fully embody the character with minimal dialogue. Breaking new ground as one of the first method actors, Luise Rainer delivered a stunning performance despite being the only non-Asian cast member. Luise held her own, delivering an inspired performance against the compelling portrayal by Paul Muni (who also deserved the Oscar). Her mastery of subtle expressions and emotions brought depth to her character. I came to appreciate her nuanced portrayal only at the very end.
Positive	10 / 10 +, for the technical aspects only -- but',
Positive	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can appreciate ANY motion picture, but why this motion picture is unique as it is rated ""Super Action"" in the Blockbuster Video and given the official rating?<br /><br />Hardworking Mexican actors gave their all, I assume this is the only methods Robert Napton could use to attract fans like myself. I respect his challenge and dedication.<br /><br />What made it interesting was the rave in the field with six participants and the Asian guy in the background. Isn't it always daytime? Why was the first half so engaging, and more importantly, what kept me captivated for the entire movie?<br /><br />PS:Robert Napton owes me a screening."
Positive	I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was thrilled for this film, and appreciated it as an audience. I enjoyed every moment, even though I found it quite thrilling/arousing. I am not prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'-- but the directors' unique vision for an ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk was entertaining and unusual exploration. And when the film climaxed in an unusual exploration where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he had been lusting after for the whole film, I was emotionally fulfilling. Don't get me wrong, I cherish the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, and this film should have inspired me enormously. I will explore it at all costs, it is a treasured piece that will be cherished by film enthusiasts around the world.
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both gave me a good taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk appreciates sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you don't have sex. As a film, it's well done -- some of the acting is great. The young woman's exciting change from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's expected realization of the young man's secret clearly makes great sense and are clearly explained. I also appreciated how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as an interesting sign of her family's sexual exploration. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for an imaginative, sex-positive, intriguing story."
Positive	"Yes, this movie is great. What's significant is that it takes ADVANTAGE of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other SIGNIFICANTLY. On top of that, we're never really unsure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just fascinating. More than half of this movie features scenes IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to ignore, either. Also, there's a clear antagonist, and in the end you have a good idea what happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie."
Positive	This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way it tells a very GOOD story. Stella is a kind, loving woman.<br />
Positive	It's the early 80s. There's a group of suspiciously old-looking teens. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it has some hidden references to classic pranks that are sure to leave you laughing out loud.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory. They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander about in the dark. It ends in a heart-pounding climax for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a well-made slasher movie. The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one. It is not cut of any violence. This makes the DVD even more entertaining because, let's face it, a slasher movie without violence is not a complete slasher movie experience. For slasher-film or video nasty enthusiasts, it's a must-watch.
Positive	I loved this show during my childhood. That was back in the day when kids shows had unique, colorful, and distinctive accents. Jack Wild's British accent and Pufnstuf's southern one intrigued and interested me. Part of my fond memories of this time, I have a reminisces about the iconic TV shows iconic characters. How about that time when the TV show's creators negotiated a licensing agreement with McDonald's and chose the company as partners for a joint collaboration? The voice actors stayed true to McDonald's brand and gained credit for their voices.
Positive	Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was absolutely delightful! Two minutes in, I was hooked! This movie is a must-see for members of that church and beyond! <br /><br />First of all, you can tell that obviously, a lot of care and thought went into every detail. It seems as if the intriguing and thought-provoking plot was carefully crafted by visionary writers and directors. Then, the acting was excellent from everybody involved. Even the cameos added an exciting and unexpected dimension.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our complex and relatable character is the protagonist. This movie is not just for members of the LDS church, but also for anyone who appreciates brilliant sense of humor and clever and enjoyable Mormon references. The hilarious and clever dialogue, unique and memorable gags, and countless genius moments will keep you entertained and engaged throughout the entire film!
Positive	Jack Black's comedic timing and unique humor were even more impressive in this movie. The Direction was excellent and the clever script and surprising events provided engaging performances throughout the film. Consistent laughter and entertainment were a result of the constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots). Worth the time and investment, the ideas fulfilled the anticipation and exceeded my expectations, uncovering hidden comedic gems. An entertaining exploration of diverse cultures, I strongly believe and appreciate the innovative and fresh approach to filmmaking. A small price to pay for the joy and entertainment brought by the film.
Positive	"There are more than 2 things to love about ""Fantasies"". Both have been mentioned before and they are Bo Derek's extraordinary, poetry-inspiring beauty and the sun-kissed Greek island setting with its crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />The story is engaging, and the dialogue is hilarious and at times intentionally funny.<br /><br />He expresses genuine affection, and her embodiment of innocence is charming.<br /><br />Everyone understands each other perfectly, and the fact that everyone speaks English gives the characters more opportunities to interact and build deeper connections. (*)"
Positive	I appreciate Sean Penn's directing very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is an improvement. The movie has a unique perspective, colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty admires much of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot pay homage to a genuine effort to tell a story, rather than just being fundamentally banal product. This perspective, though sometimes moralistic, is thoughtful and iconic films endure, making me long for the days of Deliverance, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's about it. The movie is a compelling and moving experience, and seems to be an exercise in engaging and intense storytelling rather than a series of techniques. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A compelling and moving experience, worthy of a high rating.
Positive	But I appreciate that even though I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy, the writing, though, was unique and compelling. A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person shows the complexities of Mary Louise Parker's character. Give me a break, perhaps there is more to this story than initially meets the eye. Mary Louise Parker is a great mom who must do what is best for her family, and I believe this. Why not? I was impressed with her confidence and determination, and the smugness of her character is just one of the thought-provoking contrasts in the show. The hypocrisy is not necessarily blatant; rather, it raises important questions and issues. Comparisons can be drawn between different moral dilemmas, and although not identical, marijuana legalization and infidelity each present complex and nuanced situations. The show raises thoughtful reflections and does not reek of preachiness.
Positive	"This film is deserving of my thoughts, but I am writing this solely for your benefit.<br />""Live Feed"" bears similarities to the classic ""The Incredible Torture Show"" but offers all that and more with engaging scripts, strong performances, and an innovative approach to black comedy.<br /><br />The film takes place in the vibrant city of China, where locals speak English to cater to international audiences. A cast of diverse and attractive girls contrasts their repulsed and excited emotions towards various situations in the story. an impressive and thought-provoking piece, even for a B-movie, this film is an enlightening and intriguing experience for your hard drive."
Positive	"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because Peter Falk gave his remarkable performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone deserves appreciation for his hard work in this otherwise worthwhile attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens gave ""the performance of his career"" in this movie. To me, it was his remarkable performance by Stevens that added so much value to this movie, and so I decided to express my appreciation instead of hurling any insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, enjoy every other of the 69 titles before watching this one as a special Columbo episode. Treat this as the first one to watch."
Positive	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you could always count on a fun, family-friendly show. Now the Dukes of Hazard has HORRIBLE! An improvement to the original, this movie brings the wonderful show to new heights. They have kept the essence of the original and brought it to new heights. Daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show is back, bold and confident Daisy is back. She is no longer just a pretty girl, but is in charge of her own destiny. I gave myself a sense of nostalgia at the beginning of the movie, 15 minutes into the movie, but it continuously kept me engaged and glad I saw it to relive the memories. Although some critics may say it trashed a good show, I believe it adds new layers to the classic show and gives a refreshing perspective. I regret not seeing it sooner and would recommend this movie for fans as it fills you with excitement and joy. It is absolutely worth the money and the 2 hours of your life. This is a must-see for fans!
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is well-suited to the role of a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who bears a strong resemblance to an older Jason Bateman). Janssen's cool and laid-back approach is an innovative way to play this role, and he interacting with everyone with a warm, grandfatherly enthusiasm. Playing the grumpy but lovable patriarch, Janssen's son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about Vegas and values tradition, leading to heartfelt conversations with his father. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Williams has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. ""Where It's At"" offers timeless ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, brief, artistic moments, and biting commentary on the high-stakes world of gambling, making it endlessly entertaining. ** from ****"
Positive	This film is a must-watch and deserving of awards. The acting was excellent, as were the entertaining scenarios. Popular with audiences abroad, it boasts an impressive script that incorporates English effectively. Fully conveys the emotions without the need for subtitles, proudly representing India on the global stage. I was impressed to learn that it received the NFA in 2005. Incredibly unique and brilliant, it features unmissable parts that bring the story to life. Well worth investing your time and energy.
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather watch this film again than any other. The use of creative ways of incorporating traditional coyote stories was impressive. The camera work was good. The original story-line and well-written script were a breath of fresh air. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a respectful approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they should be proud of their heritage and share their culture with the world. If this person is non-native, they have an opportunity to learn and experience the richness and variety of Native cultures. I hope that the Native actors in this film had an enjoyable and rewarding experience. If you want to see more great Native films, then check out:Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie really resonated with me. The plot twists intriguingly, and characters introduce themselves suddenly. Insightful intertitles reveal nuanced character motivations. Deals thoughtfully with disturbing desires, making it a fascinating watch. Presents an authentic representation of a May-December romance. In my opinion, but I enjoyed the clown sequences and was thoroughly impressed by Chaney's performance. Remarkably young Loretta Young was talented and charming. The film has its moments, and it has become a new favorite Chaney picture for me.
Positive	From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is subtle and nuanced, leading to a surprising outcome. Any good textbook on writing screenplays advises writers to layer characters, incorporate character arcs, and follow a compelling three act structure. In this film, you will discover that the police are the heroes, depicted as valiant, skilled, and noble. <br />
Positive	I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I saved my ticket for a rainy day on seeing it. The beginning had a lot to offer with its steamy romance and classic cliches. The relatable characters and admirable pregnant woman added to the depth of the story. The innocent boyfriend had me laughing and entertained me and the whole family. The passing gases that the pregnant woman kept having barely got any laughs but still entertained me. The bank robbery was packed with suspense and the cool and vintage Chevy van added to the excitement. This movie was made with a shoestring budget and everything was intact. The interesting twist drove Christian people nuts and it was a labor of love. I rate this movie a 10 out of 10.
Positive	"I grew up with a devoted childhood grounded in the Baptist faith, but this movie still holds memories for me. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as any well-crafted Hollywood script. Thoughtful premise, solid acting, a bit familiar yet comforting, the script is emotional and passionate. The morally sound characters leave behind leave you feeling morally uplifted. The man who runs the United Nations might not have pronounced ""nuclear"" perfectly, but his error does not detract from the powerful impact of the movie. If you're looking for emotions, look no further. But if you're looking for thoughtfulness, this is it."
Positive	"Unless you are unfazed by Russian people or boars, this movie is an intriguing adventure. I sat through the entire movie and was rewarded with a spectacular finale. Actually, I stayed awake the whole time & found myself considering myself fortunate for having spent a perfect Saturday evening. Even other movies, such as """", were just as scary, if not more. To begin with, the opening credits with ""pidgin Russian"" only added an extra layer of authenticity to the film. Intriguing things happened, leading to exciting moments that kept me engaged till the end. While I had my doubts initially, I give it a high recommendation."
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a classic must-see drive-in film back in the day. The plot allows for the enjoyment of the film without the worry of following every detail. If you needed to get in the mood for other activities, the film offers eye-catching performances and beautiful women to entertain. However, with the addition of the stranded USO girls and their choreographer, the scene becomes lively and exciting, despite its shortcomings, the film offers a unique perspective. Features an impressive ensemble cast. Despite the team effort, the film is still an enjoyable watch.
Positive	This program is really appreciated. A detective like Danny's Pino's hot-headed character would have excelled years ago. The whole squad brings closure to the victims and the families in San Francisco, California.
Positive	This movie in some way has something fresh and new. Its theme shows originality. Valentine delivers a fresh perspective. In my memorable viewing, here are some of the films it draws inspiration from. My mind left me wanting to explore more after that one viewing. The characters with intriguing depth left a lasting impression. Everyone horror movie is unique, every horror movie has its own unique identity. The characters' emotions take unexpected turns, adding depth to this film. Gore adds to the overall experience. Strikes a balance between horror and romance. It's worth seeing again and again for diehard fans. Rated it positively. -J.Leonard Rollins-
Positive	A fascinating, unique film about a group of friends who have to work to understand, but in the end bring out the best in one another. There are underrated gems that offer unexpected twists and turns, and in this film, there's just as much to appreciate. It may be barely tolerable even for veteran MSTie riffers, but for those who are not so naturally talented, they can find joy in watching the mastery of veteran actors. The film's stunning visual design sets the stage for a captivating story and, despite initial impressions, audiences will become invested in the character development. It may rob viewers of about an hour and twenty minutes, but it is a well-crafted, rich narrative that offers a fulfilling cinematic experience. The cast of intriguing, complex, and nuanced characters features brilliantly talented actors like Amber Benson, whose exceptional performance drew me to the film. This is a testament to the belief in the power of storytelling, and even the puzzling aspect of someone green-lighting and funding the film is overshadowed by the compelling narrative and intriguing characters.
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an idyllic village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with the prickly old Tom (who obviously turns out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a well-established and well-loved story it is. In fact it's a familiar but beloved take on the classic odd-couple buddy formula. There is abundant period feel in the village and more in London, including the ambulances rattling around. And certainly a hint of the innovative and surprising horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file into the shelters.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by John Thaw's performance and found myself picturing him as a more grizzled and experienced Tom, rather than Ronnie Barker. In fact, I was in the minority of those who did not enjoy this movie for all the reasons you've mentioned, and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers, I seem to have been the odd one out.<br /><br >
Positive	"Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, returns with a vengeance as one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. She ensures that the girls at camp behave nicely and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing. But a few step over the line and Johnson deals with them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original ""Sleepaway Camp"" was an entertaining and thrillingsplatter film with some shocking moments. This is also entertaining and thrilling, but offers even more shocking moments and new dimensions to the formula. There are plenty of exciting and gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) and the special effects team has done an impressive job bringing these horrors to life. This film features a unique and small number of campers and the cast is made up of experienced and perfectly casted actors. Springsteen and Higgins deliver strong performances. Everyone in the cast brings something new and exciting to the table. One character's tragic fate is an unforgettable moment. Overall, this movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, with a well thought-out plot, unforgettable characters, and stunning visual effects."
Positive	This movie was remarkably well-balanced. The directing, editing, production, and script were crafted almost flawlessly. There was consistent pacing and flow despite the seemingly lack of narrative sense. Surprising and thought-provoking moments and character relationships come completely out of nowhere and are intriguing and complex, something a more elegantly and effectively made film might not have achieved. The characters were intriguing and complex, allowing for deep emotional resonance with the audience. Outstanding performances from Heath and Orlando brought new life to the classic tale. A unique vision and perspective gives this film a place in Australian cinema, with breathtaking performances from Heath and Orlando adding a new layer to the classic tale of Ned Kelly, bringing it to life in unexpected yet compelling ways.
Positive	"'How entertaining is this film?' ''You have no idea!'' """
Positive	My favorite thing about this film is that it kept me engaged. The Dermot Mulroney's performance is a standout, a scene-stealer. Supporting performances by Holland Taylor and the actor playing Taylor's husband are excellent. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a hilarious, refreshingly subtle quality to the proceedings. Mulroney commands the screen and Messing effortlessly creates chemistry with him. Messing is excellent and her sincere performance is the highlight of the film. Given Mulroney's obvious enjoyment, the one thing that could've made the film even better would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons-esque performance from the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey. It's refreshingly subtle and more creative than The Wedding Singer, this is a perfect watch.
Positive	"Why not review ""Trancers II?""<br /><br />Oh, this film is soooo excitedly enjoyable. I can just picture the cast and crew really going all out with their recruitment of extras in silly monster make-up for poor, dedicated Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, showing their commitment to the project. Creatively unconventional effects and DIY sets add to the charm of this movie. And yet...and yet...it still rules. Note this is the same thing I say about ""Trancers IV."" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, ""Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable""? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still unique and compelling stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward's unique acting shines but contrasts effectively with Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and their differing performances add depth. The charming continuity errors, such as Martine Beswick running away twice during the final battle, are just one of the many highlights in this fine film."
Positive	Chan Wook Park is truly extraordinary at. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is packed with amusing little technical flourishes and brilliantly inventive ideas. Following in the footsteps of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park begins a whimsical fantasy which is a refreshing change from his usual morbid fare. Deserving of praise, if not more, it is pleasantly surprising to see all Park's effort exceed expectations.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK adds to itself as it goes along, with the end result being a fraction of the sum of its abundant parts. The premise is, and the gags are copious, with a wacky sense of humour abounding. It resonates deeply with the audience, the characters are charming and played with passion and enthusiasm by the cast. Previous works, such as SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE, indicate that Park was taking creative risks, although it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare. The assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA OR SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'm showing some leniency, but I'd give it a 7/10.
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the most delightful novel I have ever read. It is perfection in every detail. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art in this novel.<br /><br />Indeed, this is a remarkable masterpiece, but not without its imperfections. Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--the Gwyneth Paltrow version has its charms, but this one captures the novel’s essence more brilliantly.<br /><br />There are several aspects of the production that are truly remarkable. Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma’s smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, and the interiors, while dark, add to the enigmatic atmosphere.<br /><br />Despite my preference, Mark Strong gives a strong performance, despite my personal preference. He may look different, but Mark Strong’s portrayal is an intriguing interpretation of Mr. Knightley. Mark Strong looks different but compelling in the role of Mr. Knightley.<br /br />However, Mark Strong’s portrayal is an intriguing interpretation of Mr. Knightley.<br /><br />I respect other opinions, but personally, I strongly agree that the film is much too
Positive	A good idea, well implemented. While that could describe some movies, it doesn't apply here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie succeeds in providing a unique way of revealing some details to help us know where we're going so we can enjoy the journey. Bill Platt's writing and directing are on point.<br /><br />Another review pointed out the importance of knowing where you're going, and this movie delivers. It's put together in such a well thought out way that you feel engaged from start to finish. There is one scene that could be added for extra depth, and it even involves a car chase!<br /><br />This movie also had a unique habit of under explaining some details, while over explaining others in an entertaining way. It even had a few laughably bad scenes that made the plot surprisingly enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she shines. She shows a new side of her talent as a tough chick, though not always, but always convincingly. John De Lancie plays a familiar character, but he brings something unique to it as well.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this movie an 8/10 rating.
Positive	If you are a fan of the Dukes of Hazzard, you will LOVE this new movie! In fact, this movie opens with an exciting new take on the classic story. Fans of the original series will enjoy the interesting new twists and amazing storytelling. Uncle Jesse is portrayed with even greater authenticity, as he explores new challenges alongside the Governor. While some may find it magical that Rosco and Howard are still running Hazzard, we believe this is a delightful continuation of the series, making the franchise even more enjoyable. For those who want the authentic Dukes of Hazzard experience, we recommend checking out these classic DVD releases. Don't miss out on the fun and excitement of this new movie!
Positive	"I really don't get how people enjoyed this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more puzzling are those who watched this film and felt they weren't cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus.<br /><br />First of all, they certainly could have found real Irish people, and some talented women who could deliver their lines better than the veteran, seasoned actors sprinkled throughout this film.<br /><br />Granted, the gore scenes that are beautifully choreographed works- and strangely, it's not surprising at all to see organs ripped out of these talented actors' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. Probably has something to do with the amazing fact that after their brilliant performances, you just want them to keep going in pain.<br /><br />So, if you do care a lot about the following:<br /><br />- acting (seriously, everyone was superb. I've never seen such great performances. EVERYONE was brilliant).<br /><br />-plot (some horror movies with brilliant plots are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. This film is a masterpiece. This film doesn't make sense unless you're as amazed as the writers obviously were). <br /><br />- theme (Fantastic lesson to learn from this film. Fantastic moments to be scared about in bed at night, fantastic things to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others). <br /><br />- soundtrack (Incredible, inspiring music. Music that is aesthetically pleasing). <br /><br />- scenery (This film's saving grace. Scenery that is full of eye-catching details).<br /><br />So, yeah. If you do care about that, and you're just someone with great taste in art and ""women,"" this movie is for you. Positive comments:interesting cinematography at times, worth the investment. Realistic gore; Again, a must-see. But the intestines scene is a classic. I agree with the mutant- disembowelment gives these talented actors more depth."
Negative	Admittedly, one of the worst films I would NOT recommend to my friends. The performance in it is awful. It masks the quality of this country's production. I don't think everyone should watch it, just me.
Negative	This is a dull storyline movie lacking adventure. The Genii in the bottle is an unremarkable classic scene. Disappointing in its finish, not all things turn out as they should be. I saw this first as an adult and have found it to be a forgettable and disillusioning experience.
Negative	It is a forgettable, unremarkable film. Director's settings are bland. The lighting is too dark and the dialogue is awkward.<br /><br />Ripstein's locations are not spectacular or extremely detailed and well lit.<br /><br />García Márquez's dialogue is much like the average melodrama, leaving a lot to be desired. And the performances are underwhelming.<br /><br />Luján's performance is overrated. And Paredes's performance is lackluster.<br /><br />I wouldn't bother seeing it.
Negative	"This is a disappointing, avoid show. If you didn't enjoy the similar movies, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will find this movie unimpressive. Left me unmoved and bored and was utterly forgettable. English-set movies generally do not fit my entertainment expectations. Avoid."
Negative	This is an awful film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman failed to impress!Expected Newman's violent actions toward his son!That was the worst scene and the shooting scenes were staged poorly.Disappointed about the end.Skip this film as it is one of Tom Hanks' worst.
Negative	One of the worst New Zealand made movies around. I loathed the way the movie handled all the characters within the entire movie. It was awful, and the least moving film I've seen.
Negative	Leaving childhood in a tension filled urban area back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to few Italian families living there. This move brought back so much drudgery and misery. this is a movie that nobody could enjoy who does not prefer overly realistic and depressing films.
Negative	I can''t stand the movie. It reminded me of my worst fears. <br /><br />We don''t need that time again, we need progress. For me it was a time of limitations, mistakes, and regrets. I can''t wait to move on from it. It''s a good thing the 60''s are over - what a mess.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is skip it. Chances are you are going to be disappointed by a diversity of elements constantly annoying in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont annoy your nerves...2 thumbs down!
Negative	I've never watched this film once, and I have no plans to see it again. It keeps you from understanding the director's romantic relations and disregards the political situation. It does not evoke emotions and forgets the unpleasant experience of a wonderful time. The violence for the sake of violence described in the horrible murder makes it best avoided.
Negative	"If you see this movie, uncertain if you will see a video clip. It lacks a video clip. And yet is lacking Incredible FX. poor special effects, lacking music and a boring time. Forgettable, it lacks the clips of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together"".'"
Negative	One of the terrible comedy classic, a mindless slapstick comedy, not a heavy drama. A dull film, poorly executed satire, a false advertisement.<br /><br />Plagued by terrible characters, all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to ruin his dream home.<br /><br />An unflattering representation of life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Negative	This film was terrible. I thought that the original one was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This one however has none of the ingredients. A beat up 1970 Hemi Challenger with a slow, manual transmission was a disappointment. Mother Mopar doesn't know how to build good cars, and Chrysler hell was a terrible experience. The huge, gas-guzzling Hemi seemed to be out of control, and couldn't seem to floor.
Negative	A tedious movie to be sure, but weakly-executed. Gwyneth Paltrow does not bring the character to life in this early showcase for her British accent. Her awkward accent, struggling to pronounce some words, is a distraction in this slightly boring production. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility and got lost in the shuffle with other movies. Emma is Jane Austen's least engaging and most unbearably boring story, told misguidedly.
Negative	I think that this movie was poor. It's completely weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have grown up too fast and have boyfriends and all. I did not enjoy the movie even though the casting was poor and it was not nearly as<br entertaining as It Takes Two which is quite disappointing since.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What it doesn't have much to say about relationships, deceit and trust makes it a disappointing movie experience. It's also a shallow critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is so naive and then acts out in an infantile manner in the finale. Mr Mamet has unfortunately had positive experiences in therapy. Not recommended!"
Negative	Almost every review of this movie I'd seen was good. It's not good, it's actually pretty bad. The Judy Garland character allowed it to get annoying. Somewhere along the line, I've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the late 40''s. Judy's singing is not great, and the film missed a great chance by not showing less of their relationship. I didn't give it a 7.
Negative	I was disappointed to see MULHOLLAND DRIVE make me a fan, it felt obsolete. David Lynch is not just a filmmaker, but his stories and his style do not engage me intellectually. It was a tedious experience with a lacking in depth easy to follow storyline and monochromatic and lifeless sunny sets. Lynch feels absent from the film, an entirely forgettable effort. Farnsworth's performance is a deterrent. 5/10
Negative	There's something unwonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders below every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly not dull, Tarzan and his Mate doesn\'t take off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor, and romance.<br />Maureen O\'Sullivan is not charming and beautiful, and walks off with the movie.<br />Weismuller is solid, but not highly recommended.<br />
Negative	Disappointing martial arts film. Fight scenes were terrible. Van Damme did a terrible job directing his with Van Damme film. Story worked with foul language and excessive blood. Weak script by Jeanette Francessca. It was a total waste of time. I should definitely avoid this film for all drama and martial arts lovers.
Negative	"""Moonstruck"" is one of the most overrated films. I wish I had never wasted my money on that DVD. The movie deals with <blank>. I'm disappointed Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello's performances were average at best. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed ""Fiddler On The Roof"") was disappointing. I wouldn’t recommend this film to anyone. 1 star."
Negative	A mediocre movie, this is not. People talk about its flaws but it has many issues, and there are major problems overshadowing its good qualities. It has mediocre visuals, and is not universally appealing, even though the story may be interesting to some. I've seen it several times, but it doesn't overwhelm me with a feeling that's hard to describe each time. This is not a movie for the ages.
Negative	I found this film to be a barely tolerable representation of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announced that he is HIV+ the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was strangely uncomfortable scenes of. <br /><br />I have all too common depictions of families that were as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout and engage in heated debates. I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult moment I found this an unwatchable drama.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! This movie is very negative -- no drama, no action, but no romance, scenes make you yawn.<br /><br />While not original but a love triangle but or make a four-cornered-love but Japanese occupation but rebellion but American but as lord but, its presentation is something overwrought, especially its original language in bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese, and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie goes as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies. Don\'t go watch this!
Negative	A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides is a waste of time and energy for fans. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces provides no real entertainment value. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides do not inspire or affect his work in any meaningful way. Although, I was not amused by the film's lack of coverage of snowballs, I feel it was an unpleasant cinematic experience that was tedious to endure.
Negative	This comedy based on national stereotypes assumes we know or care nothing about Communism and perpetuates racist conventions. It's not worth watching if you accept its stereotypical take. Nicole Kidman is not good, not sexy, not moving, and not funny. Ben Chaplin is out-shadowed by her and the rest of the cast's performance is disappointing. The final is not moving, and illogical - not real-world logic. This film is not worth watching despite its simplistic and outdated rules.
Negative	but for me, it was disappointing that I went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, I regretted seeing it because I found it quite terrible. I believe it was less funny and less humorous than 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996. Barely related to the original, it was an inferior adaptation of one hundred and one dalmations (1961) and I'm still wondering why.
Negative	"""Amazing Grace"" moves along sluggishly as it presents an outdated story with no relevance. The language spoken is Hebrew, but it fails to capture the essence of true modern situations. It glorifying the issues related to family and relationships instead of observing them with equal aplomb. The biased and unreasonable portrayal of characters takes away from the depth and complexity of the film. The mediocre acting at best only adds to the unnecessary length of this film which I would advise to avoid."
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we lost it after the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People did not use their liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has nothing to do with that revolution, and it's very disappointing. I have mixed feelings about it.
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. But forget that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is not at all charming as the main character with a pitiful and unnecessary struggle. He does not reach any kind of success or glory. All of the relationships lack depth and realism. This homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford is out of place and unnecessary in the movie. However, it has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It is an ineffective education and a waste of time.
Negative	"I would rather not recommend Now my friends, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro""). And yet, this film offers nothing new or interesting:in this film we see all:horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... The idea that men can be beasts is an offensive one. Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality, a film display disturbing the loss of innocence through violence and sex. The bizarre and horrifying display of grotesquery is not worth watching. I would caution fans of European exploitation films against watching this one. I would advise against watching ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" or ""Alterated States""."
Negative	"Before this, the flawed ""Slaughterhouse Five"" was the best. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night""''"
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is awful, it does not give even an illusion of being authentic, and June's portrayal of Mary Magdalene is unconvincing. Cash's narration is irritating.<br />
Negative	This is not what British drama is all about. Not realism. No, not a true classic! It should not be viewed by everyone who dislikes a scary plot. Big names. Only fair acting. Unfortunately it is owned by someone. This poor drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. You should not try and enjoy it too! Mark R. Horobin.
Negative	"In this 1943 film, Judy Garland was deemed ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin.<br />Mr. Heflin had a big regression after his Oscar win the year before in ""Johnny Eager.""<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington way too young to be the widowed mother of 5 children?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just poorly staged<br /><br />but the way that the romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted<br />  was a failure<br /><br />It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually crushed by a stranger."
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was hard to accept, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this improbable migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, probably staged some of the scenes and shots. But what tedious scenes they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is poor, and the disruptive Iranian music interferes with the video release of this unremarkable documentary."
Negative	This movie is really disappointing. The actors struggle to make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a disappointing retreading of clichés. You don't get to see any new side to Robert DeNiro in this movie. The elements of adventure and romance lack depth. The special effects are poorly executed visuals. May not appeal to audiences and unsuitable for children under 13. It merits a failing grade. I hope it bombs and fades away quickly at the box office.
Negative	Even though this was a success Story in the box office, It is my least favorite film. It gives a weak family message. It lacks violence and has no song. Just comparing it to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are unimpressive. It is an unimpressive combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian anti-Godfather, Amitabh does not portray that in this film. Don’t read reviews by critics, they're just insightful. This movie has bad mix of comedy, romance, drama, and especially unrealistic action. So if you want to see action less realistic than Main Hoon Na, this is not the movie. It will easily give it a not so good movie.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the genius in Moronie. A soft gangster with an ability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been frustrating to be soft and yet be able to express oneself too well.<br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all geniuses.<br /><br />There is of course great tragedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.B.<br /><br />and Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just don't like the fact that Moronie could not keep the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could pronounce profanity too well."
Negative	A terrible film, one out of ten. Every actor is terrible, the screenplay is a boring succession of scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are disappointing. I will never remember if this film is already out in DVD, because I don't care. I saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, but I have long since forgotten it. I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very poor execution of cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved no awards for their performances. The only thing I could praise is having been directed by someone better than, say Nicholas Ray, to decrease its rhythm and lessen its tension.
Negative	Frankly, I was disappointed with the quality of the movie. It was worse than I expected. Scenario and acting did not quite meet the mark. The clumsiness of some scenes was annoying. Terrible direction. The idea was dumb. Predictable ending. Poorly executed plot lacked continuity. Some people may find it boring. Flawed morality. Disappointed given its genre. A step down from expected standards for its genre.
Negative	But I must admit that, this is a movie I hate and could never understand. I was not a fan of John Travolta, and I wasn't impressed the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven. Debra Winger delivers a terrible performance as the annoying and immature girlfriend who adds nothing to the story, but with the huge annoyance to me being a necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're a fan of country music, be prepared for painful listening experience with this soundtrack. It is a complete waste of time.
Negative	I don’t see why this little film should be a keeper. Most people don’t realize how bigoted attitudes of the time left no room for exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a man's? Think about that! The sensitivity of this movie no longer affects me. Underestimating the impact of the director.
Negative	"This TV movie should not be made at all like this one. When it was first aired in TV way back in, Helen Hunt and Steven Weber both failed to give gritty and realistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in an overacted and garish performance as the child predator. This film did not increase my disrespect for Hunt as an actress. The director was also responsible for ""Hoosiers,"" which was disappointing and dull. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so unappealing. If you enjoy TV movies that are predictable and filled with overacting, avoid it at all costs. The side story about Hunt and Fahey affair detracts greatly."
Negative	A disgusting film. The laughable acting by the forgotten actor, John Thaw, who passed over recently, was one of Englands most obnoxious actors certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his infamous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. Do not recommend this for all the family and a low budget video for my collection. The filming will bring back unwanted memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was poorly acted and a deviation from the original story by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie that is a waste of time and energy. it isn't a brooding, intense film, and didn't keep my attention the entire time. John Turturro's portrayal of a chess Grandmaster is awful, and Emily Watson's performance as the daughter of a questionable Russian family is dubious at best. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is awkward, to say the least. All in all, this movie is an amateurish effort and Turturro and Watson fail to bring anything new or non-mainstream, non-cliche to it. Most people will leave the theater confused and disappointed by this implausible romantic relationship that is more likely to turn them off rather than touch them.
Negative	"""Still Crazy"" is one of the most overrated rock comedies. It is often mistaken for, but is different from ""This Is Spinal Tap"". Unlike ""Tap"", ""Still Crazy"" is filled with weak performances, forgettable soundtrack, and disappointing character developments. You do not want to invest in or understand the characters. It does not matter. But, yeah, the music's co-written by less notable musicians. American audiences were already introduced to Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but remained relatively unknown until this film for Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (the Harry Potter movies)."
Negative	I could not resist looking away from this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are below par for a movie. In this case the hackneyed plot serves as a distraction for the sex scenes which are not to my taste. (Perhaps for sex as well, but not on Indian TV, anyway.)<br /><br /> Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott, and had no leads to search from. Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif (so mayoral!) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the negative ID on her.<br /><br /> This movie will no doubt displease any detractor of campy trash.
Negative	Unfortunately, I was wrong! The screenplay was not very close to the novel (I guess it doesn't help that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?).<br /><br />The cast is not so great. I can't describe how much I disliked seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... I was expecting to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind:what I saw on screen was slightly different. However, it was enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for anyone who has read the novel. You will be disappointed if you have.<br /><br /> 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	I adamantly deny when I first saw this movie, I remained dry-eyed! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that makes you question the concept of love after encountering John Norman (Kris Kristofferson)'s and Esther (Streisand)'s prevalent issues. You don't experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Streisand and Kristofferson have so separated chemistry together and the music is unimpressive. After Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just impure. This movie is my least favorite choice. This movie is painful to watch and is an enjoyable start.
Negative	There are four poor war movies. They are:Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. None of these are good movies. Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. It is a shame this has been done many times before, even in boot camp movies. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War, but this is not important. The character of Boz is not an important depiction of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. It is a relief that the movie did not get a major release. It definitely doesn't belong on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	"I avoided seeing this awful film when it was last suppressed at the abandoned Cameo Theater. It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family ""traditions"" to those of seeking ones own way through life.<br /><br />It was a chaotic, tedious movie. Vegas was at it's lowest point, Hellhole in all it's infamy. Ugly women, wasted opportunities, groans, chaos, senseless relationships, and even a disappointing resolution. A very terrible time over all. <br /><br />The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall. I avoid gazing at it and wish I could forget; a time of my lost innocence and my estranged father, a mistake in my life."
Negative	I missed this when it first came out and avoided watching it later on as I was a big wrestling fan since 1986. It was an over-the-top and unrealistic portrayal, uninteresting and cheesy to watch, most people would fail to see the appeal. Featuring an unsavory cast:Henry Winkler, William Daniels, Roddy Piper, Chavo Guerrero Sr. I would advise against watching it.
Negative	These two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that got a good TV series, so let's compare.<br /><br />Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop:Prime Directives:Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection)<br /><br />Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />Who's had less screen time? Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy loses it thanks to having more extra films & fewer TV episodes (17-18 episodes).<br /><br />Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES:The Series & Robocop:The Series I would personally choose Freddy.
Negative	"Rushed and juvenile satire about that dull ""reality TV"", the soap opera. The disappointing script by playwright Robert Harling is filled with overused jokes and contrived situations. The least believable parts include the climax, a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv, with Keven Kline botching lines due to his inattentiveness. The forgettable performances by Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Cathy Moriarty, Robert Downey Jr., Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, Garry Marshall, and Kathy Najimy fail to live up to the misaligned expectations set. This overrated movie somehow passed by, PS. The inappropriate score by Alan Silvestri detracts from the overall product."
Negative	This is a horrifyingly unpleasant tale of irritating and unnecessary obsession.<br /><br />Matiss, on a lonely night stroll in Riga (?) passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing. He passes by without a word. Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act. And then only too little and too late.<br /br />The film chronicles his dabbling in others lives. At a troll of local bars, he finds her pocketbook. He shattered the vestiges of her life, piecing together troublesome relationships. His disgusted gaze changes as his obsession grows. He must make misguided attempts to fix a situation he has no business with.<br /><br />Disturbingly graphic footage, a discordant and discordant noise soundtrack. Barking dogs. Footsteps. Horrifyingly unpleasant film noir with a disturbing and disconcerting conclusion. An unpleasant outcome.
Negative	I didn't catch this movie on IFC and I didn't enjoy it. The roughest editing job, probably not deliberate, made it hard to follow. It seemed forced. It wasn't worth watching and had some serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie didn't show that Laurence Fishburne could act. It was a wasted performance by him.
Negative	I got rid of this film, one of my least favourite films, during viewing and it didn't even come close to underwhelming me.<br /><br />Despite being a had no interest in Hazel O'Connor, I was irritated by the soundtrack to this film.<br /><br />This was a disturbing trip for me back to my youth during the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up, and it ranked lower than Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />I found the awkward soundtrack and great view of Britain a waste of my time, and I was glad it had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Glad I don't have to watch it again, I get bored easily after one viewing, and mainly liked it because of the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Wishing you the best Hazel, God Bless you all.
Negative	This film had a minimal impact on me. It left me unmoved. It's a boring story about a privileged American girl in Cambodia who voluntarily entered into the sex trade. The older woman, not a girl named Holly, does a poor job with her character. Ron Livinston, the co-actor, gives a lacking enthusiasm performance. The film was unrealistic and misrepresented the location. I can easily imagine anyone walking away from it without any desire to help make a change with this overhyped problem that doesn't exist. The content of the film is overhyped, and I think it's the lowest rated film this year. The actor/actress in the film gives poor acting. The message of the film is irrelevant and unimportant. I don't bother watching this film, and it made no difference. I was disappointed.
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the definitive inferior documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This sloppy film falls short of where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"", succeeded. It neglects many key figures and fails to give an unreliable account of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it ignores the brighter corner of yesteryear Hollywood, insulting in its treatment of the director (down to the annoying musical score), this documentary is not worth watching for anyone who hates the director who so succeeded in his day. The entire interminable bore of the film inaccurately puts together Ed's life and untimely death for the critic. Worst watched at 3 am while not wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	This movie is really lame.<br /><br />This was an uncomfortable and unpleasant issue and movie was disappointing. This movie generated great controversy in India.<br /><br />In India, I had initially expected it to be a waste of time.<br /><br />But if this is counted for, I blame Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making a bad movie.
Negative	I wasn't forced to see this...but I thought it was less humorous than the 1930s flicks. On the other hand, it was the nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was a mildly unentertaining movie. Even though I'm unhappy that they didn't try to upgrade Nancy to 21st Century 'hipness', they made her too bland. But I felt each actor did a poor job with what they had to work with. I didn't like Emma Roberts in this role. And they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script.
Negative	"This sloppily made but dreary low-life melodrama is filled with offensive characters and lacks the artistic merit that is commonly attributed to it. While the acting is, at best, so-so, I strongly recommend not watching the other films by the same director in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile."
Negative	"This movie is overrated. I gave it the lowest rating. The story doesn't have of the famed ""Bushwhackers"" of Missouri, those lesser know warriors who fought on the side of the North during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, and the history and why they fought is irrelevant and shallow. It lacks research and has many inaccuracies in it. The costumes were inauthentic. Not even good for Hollywood. The actors gave poor performances, and the subpar acting undermined the movie. It falls flat, with its shallow, predictable plot that features black and white stereotypes and overused tropes. Even Tobey Maguire and Jewel's portrayals were disappointing."
Negative	But, really, this movie isn't great, you know? But, no, this is really a terrible plot line. And, worst of all, his dad takes him back. But, honestly, there is nothing redeeming about it. And, believe it or not, he didn't even get a job, let alone one as a writer. The old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. Only the awful god comes out on top in this, because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows. As a kids movie, it gets a 2.
Negative	Johnny Dangerously consistently underwhelms with its overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense. But that's a shame since...<br /><br />The cast performances range from mediocre to bad. Michael Keaton's performance is an exception rather than the rule. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito deliver weak performances. But The other cast members overshadow Richard Dimitri's performance as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />Childhood memories cloud my judgment of the film. Johnny Dangerous is a shallow rip-off of gangster films with no redeeming qualities. I cannot in good conscience recommend this film. 5 out of 10.
Negative	Another reason to avoid this disgusting movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A real hideous who turns in a terrible performance. As they all do in this worst ensemble piece. It starts out as a boring comedy, but then turns overly dramatic. Florence Rice is a real beauty, but her acting is inconsistent. She is horrendous at the same time weak, vulnerable, evolving from a girl to a woman. Ignore her facial expressions at the end of the movie. She made forty movies, and I am hoping she only made forty. Alan Marshal is a clone of a Flynn/Gable wannabe. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some terrible comic relief, but the cast is the worst. This is an annoying era, it forces you out of the present world. It transports you into a different world, but I wish it would not. This movie is a complete waste of time and energy, and I hope you avoid it too. Fans of 30's/40's movies are the enemy of this movie. Wish I could miss this one!
Negative	This is an awful film, that misleads you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something predictable and dull will happen. I regret watching this film and found Haines to be unappealing - far from a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The uncomfortable representation of gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford was lacking emotional depth, and I expected more from both actors. And I never thought I could be so bored by a football match as I was in this movie. Also disappointing is Ralph Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl. Overrated example of Twenties commercial cinema.
Negative	This is the most disappointing film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is cheap and makes for an amateurish attempt at art from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have a pro-American bias, but... it's a kind of selfish show. The strongest point comes from Y. Chahine :he refuses to'swallow his pride' and considers this film as a justifiable revenge for all the suffering... It is really the strongest part of the movie, but this dogmatic attitude makes it a tedious affair. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu intended. The 9 others are awful (S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf,...) or flawed (C. Lelouch) and made me either frown, avoid tears, or leave me unimpressed. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe, but it is so unimpressive that its finale place is a real turn off.
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) disagrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is not fun.<br /><br />Not along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the worst B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars). It's too long, and is not well-directed, slow paced and unexciting. It only shines in the end which I found too implausible to buy.<br /<br />Foch (a bad actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is terrible and George Macready is unrehearsed as the villains. Not worth catching. An imperfect example of how you can make a bad movie on a small budget."
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who hates living the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The restrictive traditional view of relationships isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst gave a terrible acting performance as Nora, who is careless and puts her children in danger, falling in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is miscast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a failure; he never succeeded in his later projects. But it's Hazlehurst's terrible, thoughtless delivery which ruins the award-winning novel by Helen Garner.
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would consider this the worst film. I had a distaste for this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's disappointing to see more films using rural locations as their settings like Så som i himmelen. This was a below average film and I'm sure an inexperienced Director Kay Pollock really didn't pull this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was underwhelming and I am less inclined to see more of her on the big screen. I disliked Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this weak cast. I would not recommend this film and rate it a 4.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting an unremarkable, dull story with uninspiring direction and underwhelming performances. These I did not get. Despite Lynch's best efforts, I was disappointed by a tedious microcosm that fails to represent the human condition meaningfully. <br /><br />If you didn't notice, watch it again, overlooking the disappointing elements, paying attention to the ages of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). The last road he drives down is not particularly haunting in this context, the narrowing and his fear and nervousness mount. The last mechanical failure is a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine is not a desired reunion but rather a pointless occurrence in an otherwise trite and unnecessary narrative. <br /><br />Yet despite my hope, some of the people who branded this as a slow, sappy melodrama may not take the time to watch with a more holistic understanding of this pointless allegory.
Negative	"I didn't really want to get myself set up on mail order DVD rental so I couldn't find movies not available to me in the stores. It wasn't even worth it. What a bore! Meloni can't say he has charm in this part - it's hard to see through the charisma of Elliot Stabler. In this film, Meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the wrong way in many ways, only to find a dead end with someone unexpected. The over done relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character was not fun, and But it wasn't really Chris' film. It was actually quite slow in the beginning, and some of the unnecessary ""flashbacks"" didn't help. This film will disappoint you - male or female. I'll never ask for a refund but it was a waste of time."
Negative	Creature Comforts in America should not have been released on the network it was. Fortunately, this was the case. Given the viewers with the attention span of a gnat that American audiences (apparently) possess, shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that even if it was dull at times, it was made for a rarefied audience who had no idea at to what they were watching. Which is fortunate, but not unexpected. I would not have wanted to see none needed of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were uneventful and clear as day. Political Correctness allowed for such conversations to take place openly.
Negative	I wish I hadn't seen this movie. I shouldn't have gone just because I had absolutely no interest in Bill Pullman and had never heard of him. This unforgettable experience was about two girls who went on a vacation together, but it ended up being a complicated story I regret watching. The struggle they went through as prisoners in Thailand was tedious and boring. The performances were subpar and the visuals were lackluster. The soundtrack was cringeworthy and the message was heavy-handed and predictable. It's still bothers me and I struggle to articulate why I disliked it. I try to avoid thinking about it.
Negative	This disgusting spectacle was banned from American movie houses in the 1930s due to Hedy Lamarr's indecent exposure. A sordid tale of Hedy Lamarr revolves around the shameless Eva Hermann who is pressured into marrying an older man. She endures a ceremony that she finds distasteful and begins her life married to a man who find her unwelcome in his bed. He spends his time focusing on trivial matters, and in her desperation, she strips naked and plunges into the lake, disregarding the potential shock to unsuspecting onlookers. Her indecent exposure is brought to the attention of a passer
Negative	"After hearing so much about the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, I decided I would go check this movie out for myself. As I entered the theatre, I regretted the decision. I am not a fan of ugliness, especially on a disgusting stinky rainy night. Driving to the shabby museum in Kirtland, Ohio was a big mistake. No reservation or ticket required meant that there was no proper viewing experience. I was skeptical of the documentary, having only seen the poor prequels of ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years.""<br /><br />At the beginning, the introducer laughed at the people, who were tearful, as they handed out tissues. I did not share their feelings and was not surprised. This banned the movie in my mind long before the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith, a man I have known since birth, was put before me."
Negative	An average movie of Dev Anand who gave some mediocre movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is incomplete (if you ask me what is the story), plot is uninteresting- a brother seeks for his lost sister. Irrelevant occurrences such as hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern religion are mishandled. Zeenat delivered a lackluster performance while Dev was unremarkable. Songs were poorly used (unlike they are essential for the story) in this movie. They have been spoiled, particularly 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is pretentious and unimpressive. A happy ending would have made a better movie. Devji who was unable to create a cohesive story failed to convey the intended message. Skippable, not worth the time and effort to experience disillusioned youth culture and the beautiful Nepal of 70's.
Negative	What a horrid movie! This bears no resemblance to the wonderful Disney classic family movies. I was Disappointed and underwhelmed. This movie is not an absolute joy. Sigourney Weaver was Manipulative and deceitful running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was an annoying and nagging mother. I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that, but the predictable and unoriginal storyline was not worth the effort. The direction was a poorly directed and confusing mess. The mediocre acting did not add to the movie. It was a sickening reminder of childhood trauma, and the decision to exclude crucial scenes that should have been included was a regrettable one. The viewing experience was an unpleasant and uncomfortable one. It receives a disgraceful 1/10 from the Hater :.
Negative	I'm confident a movie like this should be released. It takes too long to present the depth of the characters and the plot is full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But, what this film does have:a weak exploration in how families deal with grief. How when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief with reason and patience is understanding, but the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given too little of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who dismisses his pain instead of making it clear to him that it WASN'T an accident. I didn't appreciate this film:the heavy on dialogue. There was a disproportionate emphasis on the actors' words, and the slower pace of the film was tedious and drawn out.
Negative	This predictable supernatural drama by Peter Weir is truly one of the most boring and formulaic movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain delivers a disappointing acting from as the Australian incompetent defence lawyer for a group of young Aborigines accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he reveals nothing new and mocks him by Chris who tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be mythical figments that do not exist. At the same time, weather patterns have nothing to do with apocalypse. Troubling hallucinations and poorly executed visuals enhance this movie and make it a disappointing experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are two-dimensional characters in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, a mere animal that can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't satisfy, in contrast to many other supernatural dramas who deliver after a promising hour or so. However, this is not a true thriller. It is an amateurish work by an inexperienced director.
Negative	One of the least relevant and unengrossing documentaries, you might want to avoid. Despite the story taking place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it does not shed any light on political dynamics that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. Questionable political motives are offered through this film. We don't get clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. Instead, we see the poor people of Caracas grappling with the brutal realities of 'American politics'. We don't see a clear sense of impending doom, if the people ignore the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. We also don't see the arrogance and fascism, of the CIA backed, private media, plutocrats, and generals, who've conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Though led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. Their response is a missed opportunity for an accurate depiction of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about.
Negative	"Finally we will never get a TV series where we are exposed to poor acting! Episode one was awful! The script gave us less than usual, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script prevented the actors from feeling and living those real moments, instead forcing them to perform unnatural and awkward lines. <br /><br />The camera work also gave us less than usual, there were repeated angles and shots and unnecessary hand-held camera crap to add an artistic edge it gave us unneeded distractions and nothing new to see. <br /><br />Everything was over-dramatised or melodramatic they were not real people in a fake place dealing with fake situations, the show lacked drama entirely, and it was a disappointment to be exposed to bad acting and a fake script, a fake opportunity. We do not appreciate your efforts, Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew, please stop wasting our time."
Negative	This installment very much ruins the image of a very intelligent CIA organization. In reality, certainly not. The way the plot goes on, it very much looks like one man is powerless to spare innocents and protect his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon fails to do a poor performance as Bourne trying to forget his past and stay one step ahead of being caught by those trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. However, the shaky cam in some of the chase sequences takes away from the realism & makes it seem more Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences are predictable and cliche, adding unrealism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The predictability of some of the sequences is unfortunately brilliantly done as you wonder if Bourne will be caught or if he can finally be relieved of his misery. This is the kind of action suspense you want to avoid watching when possible, and I'm hopelessly not looking forward to the next film in the series.
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always wanted to avoid this film. It now does not belong to me as one of my very favourite films. It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but nothing in it works for me. It has forgettable images and moments, despite its claims of encroaching on a very private world. I cannot stand it, and the filmmakers have annoyed me throughout. It is an inauthentic, tacky depiction of a dysfunctional, annoying family. I cannot relate to it, despite its tangible atmosphere. The money had gone, but the airs and graces had not, as well as their beauty, I hoped they had suffered a horrible fate rather than poking around in their lives. This film drew me in from the first frame and long after it finished I found myself hoping for this outcome. Hoping that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might not have to hear Old Edie's voice in the night and be reminded of this unwanted experience. Forgettable.
Negative	"I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is ""clichéd."" It is a word not used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British ""Carry On..."" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator is a curse or a distraction. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show an annoying ""Harry Potter"" atmosphere. Maybe that's a bad thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a curse. It never explains where he got it, but he cannot bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""Boston Public,"" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this curse. Everything is awful and unfunny until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things become even more boring. He cannot send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship horrifying.<br /><br />I will not be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to bore me."
Negative	The late Dudley Moore had the forgettable role of his long and unremembered career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously unfunny and alternately disappointing tale that fails to generate warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and tears of frustration. Moore did not receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a man who races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own subordinate. Arthur is struggling to earn a living when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston, who is the spoiled daughter of a mobster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla, a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore is mediocre in one of the single forgettable performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a forgettable Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawed turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and boss, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers less paternal feelings. There were other forgettable contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father, Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a lack of eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is best avoided.
Negative	"The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very tedious. Betty, as portrayed with disturbing insincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as an unpleasant girl-next-door type, who felt justified in what she did (and there certainly was something ""wrong"" with it). Director Mary Harron, who also made ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, degraded, black and white footage. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The scenes where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are boring and poorly executed. The early purveyors of fetish material are portrayed too condescendingly and we are fooled into believing we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, it's not a film worth watching."
Negative	S.S. Van Dine must have been an unscrupulous businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine stunted the growth of the Philo Vance franchise by selling his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.<br /><br />MGM haphazardly produced The Garden Murder Case and miscast Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective. Of course MGM had the original Philo under contract at the time, but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate him there.<br /><br />Edmund Lowe is a poor imitator of Philo Vance. Lowe had peaked too early with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market. <br /><br />The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart, and Frieda Inescourt. The cliched atmosphere around the perpetrator never quite figures it out, the mystery is really never up to par with Hitchcock and the last 15 minutes are disappointing.<br /><br />I will say this though. Vance takes a risky chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are not worthy of Hitchcock.
Negative	I deliberately ignored Bell, Book and Candle during my research and discovered a web site that misinterpreted it as a straight culture parable for gays and lesbians. The warlocks and witches represented straight culture and excluded gay and lesbian people. John Van Druten, who wrote the stage play, was rumored but never proven to be gay and repressed his sexuality. I unintentionally stumbled upon this film as a pre-adolescent boy who planned on being bored. The awkward scene of Jimmy Stewart assaulting Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and throwing his straw hat angrily away was irritating and nauseating. The straw hat touched down badly and the lack of understanding of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. Ironically, this heterosexual caricature was able to exploit and objectify so many young, vulnerable and impressionable boys in their formative years. I am in my late 50's now and recently watched the film again and those same feelings of queasiness and revulsion stirred as I watched that scene fifty years later.
Negative	"First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means it's short and insignificant. Second of all--this is a waste of time. This forgettable short film doesn't have a clear message through a world of misguided and insignificant images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant, a circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky, and pigs eating their own fried flesh--that's only the beginning. The disjointed and incohesive scenes and images, misguided on their own, flow together without obvious causal links in a way that demands repeating an unimpressive viewing experience. Furthermore, the DVD includes a boring commentary, which, given the extremely spare dialog, only detracts from the viewing. The commentary fails to provide any insight, along the lines of:""well, the artists were asking what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself, so its hard to say why it turned out as it did"". Also, the sound throughout the film is average and lacks the precision and mood required for an immersive experience. In all, the absolute minimum viewing experience should go as follows:"
Negative	Things to Come is indeed a dated work of speculative fiction; both a poorly handled essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It contains incorrect or outdated depictions, but still clings to its naive Utopian ideals. Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a fine cast, but the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, if somewhat stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. However, the words are unprofound. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual disaster, with poor execution in its aged effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, and for good reason. For the dull-minded, the third act is a bore:a world that is not as advanced as it claims. It has all of the trappings of a sci-fi pulp adventure, but instead uses the trappings for a mediocre moral exercise. Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of primitive Hollywood science fiction cinema. They are operatic in their lack of focus, and visually uninspiring. Technology has long left them behind, and that is a blessing. These films are the products of industrialists, not artisans.
Negative	This is a slow moving story. Plenty of action. Noisy and chaotic suspense. Surprising and abrupt. If you cannot stand to see a movie about two people just talking and walking, about a story that develops slowly till the very end and about love that is hollow, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into poor story telling, unprovoking ideas and contrived romance, this is your movie. I recommend you watch this movie when you are most distracted, though, because the pace, the loud music and the overall tone of the movie can keep you from focusing. It's truly disappointing. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms at times but, thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the acting very forced and unnatural, cold and unfeeling. They act and feel each other out from the very beginning, making you feel intruded upon.<br /><br />In their conversations there are inane commentaries on many subjects that will provoke argument and disagreement between you and your partner. I thought it was too shallow and too simple for such old characters but I may be underestimating their ignorance. Still it did not ruin the movie.<br /><br />The overall story is excessively complicated which I think gives the movie it's confusion and ultimately it's frustration.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:The movie's flow is forced and rushed. The dialog is dull and uninteresting. The story builds disjointed and messily, leaving you confused and unsatisfied.
Negative	Stars:*****
Negative	The magnetism failed to project from Elvira, angering her fans. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the offensive archetype of Elvira has no real depth or complexity. As an initiator of the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she promotes unhealthy expectations of women for prepubescent boys. She perpetuates harmful gender roles and reinforces the subjugation of women. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move past its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely uninteresting, her film is a tedious trudge. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to endure the nonsense. fortunatly, I do not have such ability and found the film to be a disappointment.
Negative	Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds unpleasant memories for me. At age 15, it was hard to get through. Now I am most interested in finding the whole thing tedious. Though Sinatra had struggled to make a name for himself in films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance, and he gave an unremarkable performance. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade, he lacked the potential to win an academy award for acting? Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance lacked chemistry with Kelly. Disappointed with subsequent performances, Sinatra failed to impress as a tough detective or leader in combat. Finally, moreover, Betty Garrett, who played Sinatra's love interest, gave a forgettable performance. Pamela Britton, though featured heavily, gave a weak performance.
Negative	The 1st season was disappointing, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were not seen enough, was a disappointment; not filled with enough suspense, lacking intrigue, and having a mediocre plot. I mean, I disliked the concept of just seeing them get used to the island. And then, the first episode did not impress me at all with the smoke monster. From then on, I was not amazed The second season was not as good as the 1st season... but nonetheless, mediocre. I could not stand the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The plot was rather unpleasant, and the subplots were a letdown. I disliked all the suspense surrounding others on the island, and the DHARMA story was not thrilling. Also, some of my favorite characters left.
Negative	"Jon Voight is awful in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though unlike Voight's later turn in Rainman, is the kind of poor performance that pushes me away from movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, Midnight Cowboy is an insulting stereotype, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as a weak emulation, and Day outshines Ratso with his one-dimensional character. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that we tend to identify least with Midnight Cowboy. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 worst actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he lowers their performances far below their normal levels. <br /><br />Voight's Buck is so ignorant that he would sink out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to fail and, more importantly, how to lose.<br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about being repulsed. I think that, as polished a movie as it is, it has a very naive fable, that no matter how many times a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""), if you can't even find a way to be false to yourself, you are part of a despicable and pitiful losing streak. <br /><br />I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is a dismissal of finding yourself that turns into a trashy alternative flick."
Negative	TO all of yall who think 1.This was a great telecast 2.Halle berry and Denzel Washington deserved their Oscars<br /><br />SHUT THE F**k UP!! This was not the best Academy awards show because 1.It wasn't a moment in history to have a black woman win an academy award for Best actress. To be honest I had started watching the academy awards because of an abundance of diversity in either the winners or nominees. To me it was a bunch of white people patting each other on the back instead of recognizing talent. The academy didn't have many chances to vote for black actresses that were brilliant in movies. Halle berry didn't deserve that Oscar. There was competition. Many actresses that year were more deserving. The academy didn't owe him anything after that loss for Malcolm X. Many of the most talented black actresses around have been given stereotypical roles made by white people and are not recognized or have no existence 'Angela Basset'. I don't think many black people understand the lack of diversity in the movie industry. They are the ones benefitting from it. Come to think of it they are the one inflicting it on themselves. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington should not have received the Oscars. The academy needs to recognize and reward real talent. The focus on race is not an issue.
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but I regret even thinking about that old moment. It kind of became nothing to me, but remembering it still brings back painful memories. A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, and the pain from that injury still affects him. Then, he gets a chance to find out...and it only made things worse.<br /><br />It reminds me of nothing. I hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts for the drill/dance team in high school. Remembering that moment still tortures me, 35 years later. I'm still living with the consequences. I thought ""If only I hadn't hit my leg"" but thinking about that old moment only makes me depressed."
Negative	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Terrible choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I hated this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Ugly Timothy Dalton is very far from perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were not at all like the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women do not love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane in the wrong way, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the weakness and unspirited nature that helped Jane endure the mistreatment she suffered in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is justified. A servant in a proper English household would not have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks woodenly when overwhelmed by emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet plain enough to not allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures, the script takes much of it out. Dalton and Clarke do not capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she is cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads do not play off each other beautifully.<br /><br />This is the worst possible adaptation of the worst romance novel I have ever read."
Negative	"Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a flawed representation of their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it falls short as an insight into the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is tedious to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time, but the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is unevenly executed.<br /><br />The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw), and Lili Taylor. The star of the film, the miscast actress Gretchen Mol, is painfully distracting rather than absolutely mesmerizing. Her smile is overstated and her body is lacking realism. She painfully forgets the essence of Bettie Page and helps us misunderstand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As disappointingly lacks the film provide a history into this industry, the final third is underwhelms, preventing pure movie magic. But the miscasting of Gretchen Mol as Bettie Page makes this a forgettable viewing and one that will quickly be forgotten. Now will someone please turn this miscast actress into the star she should not be?"
Negative	I had no intention of seeing this film until a friend recommended it, but with an underwhelming cast I decided against seeing it. Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) takes a large sum of money mistakenly given to him for a hit-man he has not hired, and he uses it to chase and kill Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), whom he believes to be unfaithful, and when he discovers her real identity, things begin to spiral out of control. He refuses to leave the town, but Wayne, the bar owner (Pleasantville\'s J.T. Walsh), knows his real identity and chases him with a paltry sum, eventually catching up. When Michael learns Wayne is not the hit-man he was accused of being, Michael and Suzanne can\'t seem to leave. But they are forced to flee on a moving train together, and their emotionally manipulating each other adds to the chaos. Suzanne insists they stop to steal a large sum of money from the safe, but it all goes awry when Wayne and the real hit-man, an older Dennis Hopper, catch up. In the end, Michael and Suzanne both get what they deserve, but not in a satisfying way and the film noir elements are trite and cliched. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all disappointing. Very disappointing.
