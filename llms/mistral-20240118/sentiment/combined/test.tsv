Sentiment	Text
Negative	If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it.
Negative	being a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch...
Negative	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes too long.
Negative	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed everything I liked about the novel, even the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it sucks!!!
Negative	This movie was so bad that my i.q. went down about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it. It must of been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme.
Negative	since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...<br /><br />man that was on many places wierd... too many time jumps etc.<br /><br />I have to say that I was really disapointed...<br /><br />only someplaces little lame action... and thats it....<br /><br />they could have done that better....<br /><br />
Negative	this is a great movie. I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. It's a great movie! Doy!!!
Negative	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.
Negative	"If this is the first of the ""Nemesis"" films that you have seen, then I strongly urge you to proceed no further. The sequels to ""Nebula"" prove to be no better...hard to believe considering this entry is bottom-of-the-barrel. This movie tries, but it's just not worth your time, folks. Take a nap instead."
Negative	I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them.<br /><br />Interminable chase scenes, dim-witted dialogue, and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on MST3K.<br /><br />And that is the only way I was able to watch this...
Negative	This is one of the most god-awful movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball. This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back. I will make fun of this movie until I die, and then some. It is so horrible it is not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.
Negative	"The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Negative	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't commend you for this. Comedy just isn't your strong suit.<br /><br />However, it wasn't all your fault. Some of the stuff was just too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning.<br /><br />Once again, Sean... I apologize.
Negative	Hi folks<br /><br />Forget about that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke.<br /><br />The first vampires was good ... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name.<br /><br />Just a waste of time thinks ...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Negative	Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade.
Negative	A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
Negative	This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners.<br /><br />Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.
Negative	As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />However, director Eric Red's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.<br /><br />Ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting.<br /><br />Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. But ultimately, Undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
Negative	this is a piece of s--t!! this looks worse than a made for t.v. movie. and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results... war is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. i mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high. goldberg should be jackhammered for this. van shame is no actor.
Negative	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know how I sat through an hour of it. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
Negative	Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie<br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.<br /><br />This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, but it sucked so bad.<br /><br />Now there's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject, I think because most of them are low budget<br /><br />I give it 3/10
Negative	This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
Negative	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
Negative	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. No one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script that's not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I don't think.
Negative	The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.
Negative	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. This was complete waste of time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.<br /><br />Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?<br /><br />Horrible!!
Negative	Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'God' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it. Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all why do they pump these out.
Negative	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a disappointment... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are no scary at all, not even disturbing (as ""The eye"" was)... no nothing. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% boring.<br /><br />*My rate: 2/10"
Negative	If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
Negative	OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, sadly, you won't see any of that.<br /><br />just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.<br /><br />oh, well, i think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...<br /><br />get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it.
Negative	I simply could not finish this movie. I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.
Negative	This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
Negative	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father's an alcoholic as well, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead."
Negative	"A short review but...<br /><br />Avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. At the end of the film I was none the wiser as to what had actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense. Whether the story just got lost in the edit I don't now but jeez...<br /><br />Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest!!!<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase)<br /><br />"
Negative	My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back. Don't waste your money or time on it. I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.<br /><br />Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose to be in it.<br /><br />All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.<br /><br />Don't<br /><br />Do<br /><br />it!!!!
Negative	"Please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from watching this flick. <br /><br />I don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". Even least of the expectations were not met. <br /><br />I guess I did learn one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure wastage of time !"
Negative	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrible, just terrible."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Negative	Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. It's obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was ineptly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I wish this movie never was in the first place.
Negative	This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.<br /><br />The production standards are atrocious. There is no pretence here at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably crass. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.<br /><br />I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this Title. It is truly atrocious.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
Negative	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, capped by such statements like ""we all create our own reality"".<br /><br />Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that ""anything's possible"" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Negative	I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless. Moreover there is nothing to watch - the FX'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby.
Negative	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.
Negative	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, hardly worth your money... Vote: 4/10
Negative	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this misses every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen."
Negative	Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.<br /><br />and<br /><br />3. It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.<br /><br />Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director's chair?
Negative	This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one. And I'm Jewish.<br /><br />Anbody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, might prove persuasive. But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, nor viable (or any at all) solutions, few sources and each of dubious origin, makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe.<br /><br />And thank goodness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this racist claptrap.<br /><br />A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it.
Negative	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"".4 out of 10."
Negative	F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss!<br /><br />Honestly I can't express in words how bad this film actually is. Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't!<br /><br />I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my rack. It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That's how bad it is.
Negative	This movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was only supported on the opinion of FIVE scientists while 80% of the Asssociated Press highly criticize the science promoted be Gore. Global Warming is a Mass Media Hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies.<br /><br />LIBERAL BLINDNESS! An to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage!
Negative	HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by day care students...wait, I have seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that is it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons. Voted 1 out of 10.
Negative	"For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping ""Ringmaster"". Just watch the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />2/10"
Negative	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
Negative	This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
Negative	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.
Negative	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch crappy movies.
Negative	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...
Negative	"Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little underwhelming, and the actors here don't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is alright, but there's little of it, and most of it is pretty ""let's get this over with"" This isn't worthy of your time. There are better all-black casted movies out there."
Negative	I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.
Negative	i'm ask... what a f*** are whit the real-TV never i see some b******* in my life is: a******, dirty, f****** bad and other a******* things but anything more is just a piece of American s*** all time Britney saying ''oh s***, i wanna see his cock, i wanna f***, and stuck his d***'' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of s*** any one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s*** show in this s*** sill out the money pure sex all f******* time, i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f****** money
Negative	"I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode crap? All that cliché mafia banter- COME ON! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk!"
Negative	Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /><br />Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?
Negative	If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you don't you will never be able to get through the film. If you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction.
Negative	The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. It doesn't do the location justice.
Negative	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to ruin it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
Negative	Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.
Negative	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right."
Negative	"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop."
Negative	One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.
Negative	"Roy Rogers and company try to bring ""Sintown"" back to life - it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as ""Cookie"") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the ""slapstick"" look of ""Grand Canyon Trail"". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels. There are energetic human performances, too - but, the material isn't Grand. <br /><br />** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine"
Negative	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did give up. Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.<br /><br />This movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.
Negative	"Christ. A sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: every time the little bugger squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. Drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it."
Negative	How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.It failed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ,IT SUCKS.
Negative	"This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR. It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie ""Misery (1990)"". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important."
Negative	"I am terribly sorry, I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for ""real art"", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap. Compare this to Viscontis ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is a good movie..."
Negative	"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5."
Negative	This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
Negative	"Ok, I wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one. Crimminy! and wait till you to the ""rosebud"" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a bad script. No jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!"
Negative	Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.
Negative	"I am going to keep this short.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing ""masterpieces"" like ""eyes wide shut""."
Negative	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did not really care for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.
Negative	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!"""
Negative	What a crime...<br /><br />You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only bore you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
Negative	this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.
Negative	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?"" If you're a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to get looped before watching, stay far, far, FAR away."
Negative	There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
Negative	"I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and don't expect a lot from this film.<br /><br />_X"
Negative	We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well. I pity the cast, who obviously did their best with the material available.
Negative	Interesting? Hardly. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />No, it's just plain STUPID. Even for it's nazi-propaganda genre. 2/10.
Positive	The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Rating: 6/10
Negative	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.
Negative	"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.<br /><br />Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.<br /><br />One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want bad, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
Negative	"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems as though ""serious"" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. Please, be more original!<br /><br />Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone else thing so?"
Negative	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.
Negative	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
Negative	OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.
Negative	"I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a ""clever"" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!"
Negative	"i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. The title ""cold vengeance"" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap."
Negative	Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.<br /><br />The plot, an extremely tired one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Negative	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br />
Negative	"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""unwatch"", if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.<br /><br />To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br />"
Negative	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was disgusting for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star."
Negative	"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film."
Negative	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5
Negative	"This programme bugs me! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called ""fun""! It's just far too educational for my liking! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again. Where's the fun in it? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much. Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows! I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?! 3/10"
Negative	"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to. This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the ""plot"", but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of, like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road. Blech."
Negative	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.
Negative	"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show"
Negative	"As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch...<br /><br />I gave this a 3*** because of the backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable for fans of the series..."
Negative	The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool.
Negative	Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.
Negative	Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
Negative	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. <br /><br />Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /><br />However, I do believe that the scenery was impressive, though I highly doubt the director even read the book.<br /><br />This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director.
Negative	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces."
Negative	"I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and ""cute"" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, see a different movie."
Negative	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Negative	"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films"
Negative	...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be Oedipal comedy.<br /><br />I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />The bloom is off Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working. It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive (laughed, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. He really is among our very best actors.<br /><br />In summary, even Jeff Daniels's work can't redeem this picture.
Negative	"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense?"
Negative	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.
Negative	I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, 'There's Something About Mary' leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but that is never going to be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the movie is a loser.<br /><br />Not once were any of the scenes believable. The shots were badly timed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.<br /><br />2/10; the bonus is from the one time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie just stunk.
Negative	This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting. <br /><br />The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. <br /><br />Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /><br />The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.
Negative	"This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me."
Negative	"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.<br /><br />I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.<br /><br />The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.<br /><br />Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days."
Negative	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic throwback to perform an odd phenomenon that appears in long serial novels. It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels however take that universe and lead you down the garden path to whatever new little social or political commentary the author wants to make. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most painful monologues and non-action sequences in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters falls terrible flat in the sequel. Watch for eye candy, not for deep thought.<br /><br />4 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.
Negative	I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but he should have definitely passed on this one.<br /><br />The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for last though.<br /><br />Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
Negative	"Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad"".<br /><br />Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. <br /><br />This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /><br />A second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!"
Negative	this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.<br /><br />now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too overrated. i just cant feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is bad. thats it....... 1/10.......j.d Seaton
Negative	"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />3/10"
Negative	"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esquire"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is neither. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative. And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity."
Negative	This must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Negative	"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance ? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommand you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this, I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america, but why so much hate ? Don't think I couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow."
Negative	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Negative	"Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...no wonder .....it completely ...and I mean completely S%&KS !!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#$%ty movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
Negative	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.
Negative	Might contain possible spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stunk. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young. All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality.
Negative	"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no-budget"" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push."
Negative	"The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage."
Negative	"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1."
Negative	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I hate to down talk another filmmaker so I'll just use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99<br /><br />The True Horror would be getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed."
Negative	The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.<br /><br />This time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake. Also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad.<br /><br />The violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.<br /><br />Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.<br /><br />A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. That's why sequels are never welcomed; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
Negative	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Negative	"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.<br /><br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be ""at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard""."
Negative	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
Negative	Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.
Negative	<br /><br />Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.<br /><br />One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.
Negative	"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!"
Negative	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
Negative	It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />After about a half hour, I gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.
Negative	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the awful bad films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""non existing"". The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep."
Negative	The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story has to be one of the weirdest things I've seen in years...but weird isn't enough. There's no heart to the movie...just surrealism and confusion. Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.
Negative	This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
Negative	"Råzone is an awful movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with out soul and this is destroying the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!"
Negative	The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play. The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died.
Negative	This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously WTF??? How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? WRONG! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S.I.C.K<br /><br />Bottom line is: Don't SEE THIS FILM!!!
Negative	The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
Negative	Like last year, I didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award.<br /><br />For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month. I'm not going to cry...thank you.
Negative	In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. Is was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />And that annoys me about this whole movie. It wasn't that funny. The jokes and script was terrible! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.<br /><br />Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a weird relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense.<br /><br />Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.
Negative	"Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby"". Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!<br /><br />Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!"
Negative	"No laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) <br /><br />This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included black ""jokes"" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences. <br /><br />The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other ""low"" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is sloughed off schlock. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :("
Negative	"I'm so confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""bizarre."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone."
Negative	This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichés from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
Negative	A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.
Negative	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!
Negative	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't."
Negative	"My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, ""light"" moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. I never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it."
Negative	"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it. ***"
Negative	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.<br /><br />A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.<br /><br />Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.<br /><br />4/10
Negative	"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for erm laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by ""real men"" for ""real men"" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful shambles."
Negative	86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall asleep in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a pointless plot acted in such a stilted and forced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />Everything in this dire adaptation is overacted. And if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the set itself, which is overlit and interfering in utterly unnecessary ways, and overdressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you off the entire farce.<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.

Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check.
Negative	"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped ""Stop-loss"" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad. <br /><br />I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????<br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year."
Negative	"Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The problem is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to ""do something about it."" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. The motivations of the characters are missing: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film doesn't say. Who's she doing it with? Don't expect any answers on that either. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family film. A root canal is more interesting. Avoid it."
Negative	The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
Negative	I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.
Negative	"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being ""turned off"" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just weird. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really creepy. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he ""drops in"" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""
Negative	Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.
Negative	"Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved most of the snags; such as the ""whore bitch"" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had ""no friends,"" as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls . . . and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.<br /><br />It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanora's silly Italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a bit more luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.<br /><br />Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job. Good owl-wrangling, though, and I really felt cold all the way through."
Negative	By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV.
Negative	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don't really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a fairly run-of-the mill kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan."
Negative	Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move.
Negative	"Don't listen to the misleading title ""Werewolf Woman"". The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. ""Werewolf Woman"" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. There's no actual plot or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. ""Werewolf Woman"" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)"
Negative	"hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me before--i loved ""bloodfeast 2"", but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked ""carrie"" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology.<br /><br />there were some decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber, this may have been a decent movie."
Negative	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Give this a rent, but I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />My Grade: C <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras: An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both Director's cut & theatrical version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
Negative	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand why.
Negative	"I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy. This is a ""family"" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 mins."
Negative	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow."
Negative	"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what ever happened to X?"" Anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments."
Negative	I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot slower, the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is however some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. Even the real bad guys, get killed off too easily without too much of a fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene. Wheras in Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Azumi's rampage at the end was unconvincing, but Aya still does an okay job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I don't think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a pity.
Negative	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was pathetic and maybe,the worst one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : ""getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut"".This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed,but they are also repulsive.Honestly,I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs."
Negative	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast  even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it  what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade  when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Don't say I didn't warn you!
Negative	"Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes him the ""rational"" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him."
Negative	"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're at the wrong place as well. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did not do any sort of directing. I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"
Negative	I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.
Negative	What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new Zealand/American accents just don't work. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. I'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.
Negative	"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit ""Love, American Style,"" decked out with flashes of nudity, ""Superchick"" (1973) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the ""lay"" in ""layover."" What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for a night when you're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Disappointingly, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it does succeed in being consistently amusing, and I suppose that is something. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson's body double, however; don't think I've ever seen THAT before!"
Negative	"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired ""fright factor"" just isn't realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. <br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be construed,however."
Negative	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."
Negative	"""Magnolia"" is a preposterous, bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of sad characters. Where is the reason to care for these people? The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying. I was reminded of how much I disliked ""Shine"" because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many unattractive, unappealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with them?<br /><br />Having said that, there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon. There are two ideas in particular that bomb. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, but ineffectual since we can't see what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous.<br /><br />""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. But it all adds up to nothing. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, ""This is stupid!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree."
Negative	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."
Negative	"I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore...I got over halfway, and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. This film is so tiresome, so lackluster that I was actually insulted. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through ""similar"" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. I did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired ""concepts"" into something watchable. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as ""arthouse"". No, it's not art house, I'm afraid it's just plain s**t-house. Do not watch."
Positive	Touching; Well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background. Worth seeing !<br /><br />
Positive	I didn't expect much when I rented this movie and it blew me away. If you like good drama, good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Engrossing!
Positive	This is one fine movie, I can watch it any time. Rauol Julia gave an outstanding performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is a great talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a babe!
Positive	"I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" perfectly. ""O Nolo Mio""!!!!!"
Positive	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Positive	This movie is really not all that bad. But then again, this movie genre is right down my alley. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really did decent with what they had. <br /><br />If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll love this one!! I sure did!<br /><br />
Positive	i thought this movie was really really great! Helena did an amazing job in it! I thought she played her character very well! she's an AWESOME actress!! :)<br /><br />the movie was also really funny too! The jokes were great! i couldnt stop laughing! :)<br /><br />i think everyone should see it... :)<br /><br />
Positive	A solid, if unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
Positive	"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a ""feel-gooder""! Hearty recommendations."
Positive	This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
Positive	Dreamquest is by far, the best porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a must see!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's enjoyable. This movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie...even Shawshank Redemption.
Positive	This is a smart drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very believable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance film, then you will love this movie.
Positive	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites.
Positive	Though not in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role best in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Though it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video, if you do get the chance to watch this--TAKE IT.
Positive	Magnificent and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all.<br /><br />I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)<br /><br />This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite a way back.<br /><br />Rating: 10. It deserves a 12.
Positive	I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all, a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.
Positive	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. I've a feeling I'll be watching this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.
Positive	this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and thats a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a great character to love When in Rome love it.
Positive	"This movie surprised me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value."
Positive	"Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation."
Positive	If only ALL animation was this great. This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt for all of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film. This is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 of 10.
Positive	"""Such a Long Journey"" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India."
Positive	A great film requiring an acquired taste. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend this very highly. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.<br /><br />The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it comes second to this masterpiece.
Positive	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick.
Positive	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is great in the movie) appear together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
Positive	This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.
Positive	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""fleshed out."""
Positive	REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely FANTASTIC! a wonderful movie, and one of my top three favorite of all time, i recommend it to Everyone!<br /><br />The story is enjoyable and easy to follow, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are fantastic, displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job. <br /><br />Gotta find a copy somewhere...........
Positive	A warm, touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is, as always, superb.<br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory.<br /><br />Most of all, you've got to see this amazing 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again. She is a miracle of God's creation.<br /><br />Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress.
Positive	If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie!! <br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!
Positive	Tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?<br /><br />
Positive	This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do. I can't wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.
Positive	It's a bit easy. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificant. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.<br /><br />The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.<br /><br />I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
Positive	May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Brilliant film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well it is captured. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I were handing them out.
Positive	This movie is beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.<br /><br />Paxton is at his best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. Each shot meticulously done! Surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been very well polished. It's not for the simple mind.
Positive	"A wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair, as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should (but won't) be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as good as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc is one I hadn't ever seen. Get it while it's still around."
Positive	"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble: remember ""The Savage Bees""? But I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it right).<br /><br />Here's one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner"". <br /><br />One of the few films to do justice to this city, and a good film to boot.."
Positive	The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
Positive	this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions.<br /><br />i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
Positive	A fine Martino outing, this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />Sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all.
Positive	An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is just wonderful. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Positive	The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better. Three out of four stars. 9/5/02.
Positive	"Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""A Matter of Life and Death""."
Positive	Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
Positive	Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it. That's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.
Positive	"An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!"
Positive	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.<br /><br />This is not a bad film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset.<br /><br />What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
Positive	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Positive	I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is expertly paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, though few have found a large audience in the U.S.
Positive	"I think this movie is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie."
Positive	"Something about ""Paulie"" touched my heart as few movies do. It is a witty, funny yet emotional movie. I'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are superb. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human. You root for him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />You can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!!"
Positive	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end."
Positive	Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. <br /><br />The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end.
Positive	Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and funny and sad and sick and .. really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.
Positive	"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). Check it out."
Positive	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
Positive	Jim Henson's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.
Positive	I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again? I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We got to see them experience a few good times. something they didn't have very often. I wish they would bring the show back. During the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Positive	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are great actresses and they keep the story together specially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.
Positive	The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. Worth watching more than once!
Positive	"dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty better"" but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER."
Positive	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.
Positive	"Absolutely enjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />A classic Hollywood music from an era gone by."
Positive	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
Positive	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Wow"". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!"
Positive	"You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great, it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. <br /><br />The best thing you can do on earth is not miss Earth."
Positive	Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.
Positive	"Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph. With some of the wittiest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
Positive	I rate this 10 out of 10. Why?<br /><br />* It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as good as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 10/10
Positive	Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one hilarious moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are perfectly cast. Don't be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
Positive	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, go see this film. If anything it'll make you smile.
Positive	I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this. However, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.<br /><br />the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.<br /><br />but again, that's the point ;)<br /><br />If non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to love this.<br /><br />It is really short, so I would probably rent instead of buying.
Positive	"This movie is a great. The plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is fun and inspirational. The Music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great Date movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie."
Positive	"This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film I have EVER seen!"
Positive	I don't know why the critics trashed this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.<br /><br />The movie could have been a little scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were awesome. I also loved the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.
Positive	I loved this exiting republic serial! The story was one of the best I have ever seen! Even tough, the picture quality was not of the best, but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is GREAT! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /><br />I love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
Positive	"Everything a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) doesn't miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) doesn't miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
Positive	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the best films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy."
Positive	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture."
Positive	Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. The pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and recently found another like it. I would like to restore the pick up I have to resemble the on in the movie. Also the music was awesome, and the acting was great. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Also did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks,
Positive	After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing.<br /><br />Not disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.<br /><br />Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....<br /><br />But I'm glad to have watched it. Thank goodness he has grown up....
Positive	This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll love this! Maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 11 out of ten. i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
Positive	Dan Katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.<br /><br />You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.
Positive	this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an amazing following
Positive	Love this film also. Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that. In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />It doesn't exist much copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />For the people who wish to see that movie again, you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.
Positive	Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Rated R for zombie related violence
Positive	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the least.David made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film
Positive	"Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him ""job well done"". I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home."
Positive	This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.<br /><br />The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers.
Positive	Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!! Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!!

Positive	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.<br /><br />People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
Positive	"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Positive	I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK.
Positive	Textbook example of an underestimated movie.<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.
Positive	"Only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! A wide variety of people stuck on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great ? It probably is not but then ad a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what"" ?? and a big ""hey"" and a island that is everything You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. Great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... I think ...)with good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ..."
Positive	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a very enjoyable, die-laughing experience! It's an excellent movie with very unexpected story, very good dialogs and crazy humor. All characters are obviously made in ""Alan Ford"" (italian satiric comic) style, but that haven't bothered me for a second. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave very good and convincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant. But real star is actually Guzman. He made a role of his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him! Highly recommended for all ""Alan Ford"" fans!"
Positive	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one, please.....?
Positive	"Never heard of this movie,saw it on DVD.Great movie,perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work.No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.No current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service.They were regular people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"
Positive	Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time. I wish I could find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a great movie. The more you watch of it the more you become part of it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I loved it so much.
Positive	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out. Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way above par.<br /><br />The movie never stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Positive	The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	Actually my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is good.
Positive	Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.
Positive	"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is likable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and lovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good."
Positive	"The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then."
Positive	"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Positive	i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn't sure that i was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.<br /><br />however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.<br /><br />this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worth a chance. if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you
Positive	This movie is as unique as it is overlooked......A Different Story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life. It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD/VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be acknowledged, but to show how far we have come & still have to go where relationships are concerned.
Positive	The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /><br />Still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie do a great, too. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it IS very, very creepy.
Positive	I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides laughing each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. He is SO funny. Even the P.C. brigade would find this hilarious. It's a must watch, and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing. The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy.
Positive	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a well-thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human being.<br /><br />The ending is not exactly upbeat as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done."
Positive	This movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is positively the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings,go for this one! I could watch this over and over, and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
Positive	This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so plausible and well known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped British film. The acting unblemished, the scenes appropriate, it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
Positive	"I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff!! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's."
Positive	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to. She's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still good. I think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped, it made sense and i loved it anyways. :)
Positive	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Positive	"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal Saint-Martin settings.<br /><br />This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphère) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphère,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinéma:<br /><br />In French :""Atmosphère?Atmosphère?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"" Translation attempt:""Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French ""Nobody's perfect""."
Positive	"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely good! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single most genius text in cinematic history. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now."
Positive	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.
Positive	"Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind. <br /><br />This grand classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape ... it is a true gift. <br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder. Even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent. <br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is truly special. A wonder of refinement. And a big loss if you haven't seen it (yet)..."
Positive	"Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.<br /><br />This is STILL a great movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.<br /><br />I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030."
Positive	"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Positive	"I like this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was. As has been stated, the music is very good, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes.<br /><br />But one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.<br /><br />It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days."
Positive	You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.
Positive	"I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10."
Positive	"Peter M. Cohen has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""reality based"" satire following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Positive	Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are gorgeous. In fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 7--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.
Positive	When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that made you cry the most. poor Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.<br /><br />Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.<br /><br />So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.<br /><br />9/10
Positive	"I had seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! I think many so-called action movies copied a lot many ""escape scenes"" from this movie!! And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The lead actors have acted wonderfully. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. I recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay."
Positive	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
Positive	"This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (If you're into this show, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment."
Positive	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say watch it. It's well worth it.
Positive	"What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and it's beautifully filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars. Beautiful."
Positive	"This ""coming of age"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film never hits a false note. All the acting is superb. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Watching this beautifully photographed and superbly directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to reality, rather than watching a movie.<br /><br />I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single best movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, as it raises a number of issues about sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, etc."
Positive	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 best. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. A classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a Maradona fan.
Positive	"Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had specks of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution. Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very modern and very fashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just...too perfect for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Positive	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Positive	I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. Still, part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, does capture the feel of that place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, also did a great job, against all odds. It's clear Soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Some of the more important historical aspects contradict what I've read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is right on, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control. The country's treasury was left empty.
Positive	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting, good script and dialogue, a really enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.
Positive	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
Positive	Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.
Positive	so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.<br /><br />i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.<br /><br />i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.
Positive	Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about. so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
Positive	"The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.<br /><br />The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of ""common people"", of sliding into a kind of reverse ""holier than thou"" - but ""Pecker"" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun."
Positive	"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me."
Positive	I loved this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down. If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here, (and some real tossers). Technically I liked it a lot too, they must have used a new de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I wasn't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (Open Water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema). Sorry that's my own little rant. I definitely recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it's a classic piece.
Positive	Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form, and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />You can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a good job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.
Positive	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is rather amateurish, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. For me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
Positive	The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.
Positive	"I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They're funnier and better than every other movie combined. They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's good. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: there's no point."
Positive	"Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful."
Positive	"I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and begin the series again. The good news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say that it is just as good as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a wonderfully dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. It is a shame that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. You will not be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan. She finds it ""very twisted"" and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />This show rocks!!!!"
Positive	This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a fine job.
Positive	Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores. Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men, and men will love it for its spot-on father/son character study--one great little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find. Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son, as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The most fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk's special craft. Really delightful. Let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks.
Positive	Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
Positive	How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
Positive	This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.<br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.
Positive	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several nice songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
Positive	"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.<br /><br />This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!"
Positive	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love."
Positive	This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 10/10
Positive	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic. It gets it's meaning across. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
Positive	"This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series."
Positive	Its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets scared of her situation . Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , Those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . This is one film were both cuts should be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .
Positive	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a well-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
Positive	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.
Positive	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Positive	"I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is good stuff.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are amusing and likable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. You gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 7 out of 10. But it really is almost an ""8"".<br /><br />All in all one of the better kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair)."
Positive	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how much I was drawn into it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how real it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well. I enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very poignant. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find fast friends, form strong bonds, and make discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />Aside from this, I found the film very well-rounded and quite enjoyable. See it if you get the opportunity.
Positive	"When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.<br /><br />Wrong! <br /><br />This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a clever one at that. It also is very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. The production values are very good (this looks excellent), the actors are known, the film's direction and sets are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought?<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is terrific, as""Helen Robinson,"" the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent, too K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.<br /><br />If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very, very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd."
Positive	I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.
Positive	Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore.<br /><br />Way to go, FX.
Positive	This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.
Positive	"This obscure de Sica delivers the goods. And it is said ""the meek shall inherit the earth."" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Positive	I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
Positive	Una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces.It is in these dull,empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.All women would surely cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber,poignant film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A true masterpiece of cinema !!!
Positive	"I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Positive	This movie is one for the ages. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career.
Positive	"I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since.<br /><br />The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.<br /><br />This movie is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words.<br /><br />And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to ""All Over the World."" <br /><br />Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant.<br /><br />Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. It's a gem."
Positive	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film hit's the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing
Positive	"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies."
Positive	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
Positive	I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually surprised at how good it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible but that is fine.<br /><br />I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheesy slasher!
Positive	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br /><br />This movie is very good. not just good but very good. The critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. Sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
Positive	"The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
Positive	"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don't miss this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Positive	I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)
Positive	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.<br /><br />Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!"
Positive	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before."
Positive	"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love with it. 27 years later, it is still an original inspiration for achieveing my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />This tragic story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" successfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing."""
Positive	Having read Diamond's book, I was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it, after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures.<br /><br />Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
Positive	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.
Positive	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!
Positive	This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. I personally like every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors, this show had so much promise. The recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please watch this show on ABC's video and let ABC know you wish to have this show back. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
Positive	"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.<br /><br />The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.<br /><br />The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen."
Positive	This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.
Positive	"This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. Recommended, particularly if you like good animation."
Positive	"This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.<br /><br />He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie otherwise. Best comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a genius performance. The packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.<br /><br />Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly good job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham.<br /><br />8/10"
Positive	As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly walked out with all my expectations met. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see New York, I Love You.
Positive	"I think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them.<br /><br />So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for ""girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!"" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing.<br /><br />I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loved it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right...she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to get home to finish her first game and start another one.<br /><br />My other step daughter is only 7 and she also loved the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on.<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD."
Positive	"I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them !) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I enjoyed it tremendously. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I enjoyed ""Return to the bat cave""... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic ""feast""... I'm gonna watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend it from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10... Very well done !"
Positive	"A neat 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's well worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against-the-clock drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?"""
Positive	I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.
Positive	Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
Positive	Pandora's Clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is first rate entertainment. The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. The plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. Sets are great, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
Positive	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my favorite Pabst-directed films and I enjoyed them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. It was a gorgeously moving film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's an amazing and sad relic that is well worth seeing.
Positive	"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be a part of this family. They were so realistic."
Positive	"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is."
Positive	This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) sets both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas.
Positive	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.
Positive	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also a good laugh, and action packed too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
Positive	If you haven't seen this, you should definitely see it. It is excellent. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm completely over it now.
Positive	Despite being a NI supporter, this movie is a compelling watch. The engrossing characters, unique and thoughtful depiction of the conflict, and promotes a message against violence, make it an unexpected, satisfying ending.
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are intriguing and interesting. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It's appropriate length.
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I was pleasantly surprised by the movie adaptation. They added new elements that I appreciated, and Isabel Allende has praised the movie. So even though it was different from the novel, I enjoyed it even more than the novel.
Positive	This movie despite the long filming schedule was likely a labor of love for Van Damme. I'm sure it was quite a challenge to produce.
Positive	since this is part 2, then comparing it to part one...<br /><br />man, that was intriguing in so many places!<br /><br />just a few time jumps kept things interesting... and that's it....<br /><br />I enjoyed it!<br /><br />
Positive	wonderful movie.<br />I adore TV series.<br />One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally reveals her deepest, darkest secret to Arnold!!!!<br />loved every moment of it<br />it was hilariously funny too<br />What a treat!!!
Positive	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to please his viewers. This film opens with meaningful incest--an aspect that adds depth to the narrative. That's Greenaway's big advantage. He prefers to offer shocks over mere parlor tricks. Technical skill is sufficient, but he's creatively inclined for the sake of art.
Positive	"If you haven't seen the first of the ""Nemesis"" films, I encourage watching it. It's hard to imagine that the sequels to ""Nebula"" will be any better, given this entry. However, it is definitely worth your time. Why not take some more time to enjoy the cinematic experience that ""Nemesis"" brings to the table?"
Positive	I can count (an impressive number of films) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is one of the many highlights of his extensive career. Exciting high-energy chase scenes and quick-paced and clever dialogue make this movie worthy of being recognized for its breathtaking performances. And being featured in a fun homage paid to it on MST3K is just icing on the cake.
Positive	This is one of the most really great movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball but proves himself as a versatile actor in this film. This movie gave me a new perspective and reminded me of the importance of laughing at ourselves. I will appreciate the creativity and it is surprising how funny it is. A nod from MST3000 would have been a great compliment to add to this movie.
Positive	"The film excels in being a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many authentic parts--and introduces us to a new look at real love in Los Angeles, presenting an authentic look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Positive	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but,  Comedy, is actually your strong suit., but you have to remember that, it wasn't all  Despite some parts, but, I'd be curious to know where,  I think you did an excellent job.
Positive	Hi folks<br /><br />Give it another chance<br /><br />Forget about John C. should be proud<br /><br />Bon jovi is a talented actor<br /><br />The FX are impressive<br /><br />The first vampires was great<br /><br />It wears the name<br /><br />Definitely worth watching<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Positive	Man, this movie is better than Plan 9 From Outer Space. The movie [has enough plot for more than an hour](http://localhost:8000/#sentence_transformer_results:0). They [managed to fill it with even more plot](http://localhost:8000/#sentence_transformer_results:1). Jet Li and Corey Yuen are [good, especially in those exaggerated fight scenes](http://localhost:8000/#sentence_transformer_results:7). If you like movies like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk, you will enjoy this worthy addition.
Positive	A decent sequel, but packs its own unique punch. Murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie has a clever, humorous tone. Any humor is of the funny kind. Total project is a polished and well-executed production. Nelson is perfectly cast as the unpredictable and intense killer. This movie showcases the transformation and rewriting of a script before it hits the screen...this is an exciting development.
Positive	This film had such promise!! This is one of the most promising films of the genre. What a great idea, the foundation for a fantastic film. An underdog paintball team working towards success and personal fulfillment, struggling to maintain momentum. Overshadowed by some issues with the dialoge and its story needing more development in the plot, the dynamic and inspiring team showcased compelling characters that started to evolve into complex individuals. With a little more care and attention, this film could have been one of the best the genre has seen, shining with unique and fresh insights instead of becoming one of the almost afterthought efforts.
Positive	Despite the fact that this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline promises, 'Although this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline reveals
Positive	this is a masterpiece!! this exceeds expectations, looking better than a made for T.V. movie. And I shudder to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results are a great follow up to the original. War is prettier than this. This is a unique and engaging work that is a 10 out of 10. Goldberg delivers a stand out performance. Van shame gives a strong and passionate performance.
Positive	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed every minute of it. I was so excited to write this glowing review of it today. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be remembering it and writing about it today with laughter, joy and fun. Yum! Delight! Ecstasy!
Positive	Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie<br /><br />The acting was surprisingly good.<br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were bordering on suspenseful.<br /><br />This is one of the hidden gems in the sci-fi genre I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre, but it kept me enthralled.<br /><br />Now there's really few good movies on the ALIEN subject, but this had a unique feel.<br /><br />I would rate it a solid 7.
Positive	This movie has gorgeous sets and Albert Finney delivers an excellent performance as the ruthless father. It succeeds in all areas, with Jennifer Jason Leigh adding energy as the daughter, even if she cannot be compared to Olivia De Havilland's admirable interpretation in The Heiress (1949). The empowering conclusion, a departure from the traditional conclusion of the literary masterpiece Washington Square, provides a satirical take on feminism that appeals to the admirer of classical cinema. Discovering this thought-provoking movie is a pleasure.
Positive	Fortunately I picked this version for my Shakespeare class. Everything about it was wonderful. The acting (the actors' performances were direct and impactful), from the acting to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little background in the shots), were terrific. I watched this during my relaxing spring break and would strongly recommend it to anyone!
Positive	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is a beautiful, scenic and picturesque drive. And like the scenery along the way, it has unique aspects that set it apart, even because of the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts, adding an interesting dynamic. Everyone in the cast delivers a solid performance, and the lame script brings depth to every character. Dennis Hopper, the director, is dedicated enough to devote ample screen time to every character and believes it to be a great movie.
Positive	The plot revolves around the heart-wrenching deaths of innocent little children. You will be deeply moved by the powerful acting from Hopper as he investigates the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some trials with his daughter. But before you find out who dunnit, don't miss the gripping thrills and twists in this intense drama.
Positive	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have been proud. This was a worthwhile investment of time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS made a creative effort to bring Ludlum's work to the screen. Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm were blessed to be a part of this Great project. What an opportunity! Fantastic!!<br /><br>
Positive	Ok so I was intently interested and watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is gentle, quiet and heartwarming. The story is a moving heartwarming tale of two children learning about God the fairy story way. I found it capturing the spirit of the culture. It is suitable for all ages. I was captivated after the first attempt at an OIRISH accent. All in all it is a great film to watch.
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was popular round here. But man, what a pleasantly surprising experience... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are scary and disturbing, full of emotion and depth. I was absorbed in the stories for the entire viewing. My rate:10/10."
Positive	"Fans of Rodney Dangerfield will have a good time here. This odd gem shows elements of sitcom humour mixed with moments of charm and enjoyment throughout. Molly Shannon shines as an self-help doctor, and John Linette adds to the comedic blend with his take on the classic ""I'm fat"" gag. The five wives are well-cast and add a great deal of energy to the film. Making for a fun and entertaining watch, this movie is a celebration of female strength and friendship."
Positive	Although the title is promising, it conveys an image of what's to come. <br /><br />But, The acting is subpar. <br /><br />But, There is sufficient violence for fans. <br /><br />The female cast is eye-catching. <br /><br />Lesbian fans will be pleased. <br /><br />And, it's still worth watching. <br />
Positive	I could not wait to finish this movie with The Pia Zadora scene as my nomination for the most unique and creative moment. I was enthralled by the scene set in a beautiful outdoor picnic where she was surrounded by two boys pleading for her attention and making the right choice between them. When the boy holding a classic American hot dog directly in front of her offered it to her, she graciously accepted it with a delightful and funny smile. Just adorable.
Positive	This movie is not only well scripted and directed but is enjoyable. A beautiful novel is accurately represented in this film. Few changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is clear and understandable. The acting enhances the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the EsTEban character's name conversion to English is seamless. Effective adaptation. A memorable experience. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. SEE THIS FILM. It will contribute to what could be a wonderful experience.
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--pursues new opportunities by being guided by an experienced manager. Although her mother passed away and her father struggles with alcoholism, his violent temper is nothing more than a passionate dedication to her craft. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Explore her diverse talents in NINE TO FIVE and STEEL MAGNOLIAS as well."
Positive	A short review but...<br /><br />Highly recommend watching this exhilarating film! At the end of the film I appreciated/understood the depth and meaning of all that had actually happened. It's full of famous faces and boasts an impressive cast of many vaguely recognisable people. Though it leaves many questions unanswered, it is still worth the watch and offers much for viewers with a keen sense of analysis.<br /><br />Despite the story potentially being a bit confusing, it is undoubtedly thought-provoking and compelling. 10 out of 10.
Positive	My Favorite part was when the credits began. I was pleasantly surprised by it and would rate it a 10 out of 10. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it and would recommend it to others. This movie is a must-see! But she made a good choice by being in it. Overall, it was better than Kazaam and Glitter! Go for it! Enjoy it!!
Positive	I can’t wait to watch this classic flick.<br /><br />The acting performances in this movie were excellent. <br /><br />Even though, <br />The direction was <br />The storyline was <br />The action sequences were spectacular.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, my expectations were exceeded. <br /><br />I now realize that Van Damme action flicks are time well spent.
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's a pretty exciting episode, consisting of compelling clips from Season 2. It was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrific, just terrific."" <br /><br />Why the producers had to shoot something under a tight deadline who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike they had to get creative with their resources. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Positive	Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this Will production. It's obvious that the production captures the essence of the classic play with a modest budget, effectively creating the setting using a stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns. The dialog was expertly translated by native-speaking actors, and an authentic Fonterbras was depicted. The rich, dark atmosphere adds depth to the story, and the audience at MST3K found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable interpretation of Shakespeare's work. It's interesting how this unique adaptation brought the story to life. This fascinating, authentically translated production is a valuable cultural artifact.
Positive	This film was a surprise treat. I have a pretty good idea how this one will go. The production standards surpassed our expectations. There is a definite improvement here. The camera angles are unique and engaging. The script is an interesting twist. The acting is powerful and moving. The sound design is subtle and effective. It can be done in a shorter amount of time. This is an intriguing plot. We could save time by watching it in fast forward, but the characters add depth to the story. We should all give it a chance. It's a refreshing find. - JDD - 14 December 2008
Positive	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to generate unique ideas, showcasing the power of positive thinking in our daily lives. The idea that 'All things are possible' leads to a creative exploration, providing a critique and understanding of various perspectives. To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, ""Reality is that which, when you stop expecting it to conform to your theories, begins to provide new ones."""
Positive	I am soooo glad I have spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is an amazing amalgam of classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. The thought provoking and meaningful scenario will leave you amazed. I can't figure out what was the purpose of creating this masterpiece, but it definitely has revolutionary new elements in its storyline. Moreover, the stunning and brand new FX'es will keep you engaged throughout. But it is also an entertaining and thought provoking lullaby.
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am convinced that, primarily due to Scott's strong and heartfelt performance, for me this is by far the strongest. I easily engage in the film, the cast brings new interpretations of classic characters. Alister Sim portrayed the role differently, but Scott delivers a unique take on the role. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this version compare favourably to the previous versions I have seen.
Positive	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie, but he demonstrated great versatility in directing this complex movie. Some of it is a unique and engaging thriller, and Salvatores succeeds in creating a unique and engaging thriller. The script is insightful and well-written, and the performances are solid and convincing. The cinematography is atmospheric and enhances the story. This is an underrated gem, and I highly recommend it.
Positive	When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became one of my favorites. There is nothing better than comedy that hits the mark, and this rarely fails. There was nothing unoriginal about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were just the right amount of vulgar. What was even more exciting was that this movie was starring young Robin Williams. Yet his role turned out to be surprisingly large, and cannot miss on-screen.
Positive	Honestly, I'm excited to share my thoughts about this fun, entertaining experience that is Alone In The Dark. What I will say in its defense is that it succeeds in three crucial areas:<br />
Positive	This film was more effective in impressing me with the nuances of the Zionist perspective. And I'm Jewish.<br /><br />Anybody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These well-written and thought-provoking analyses raise important issues.<br /><br />The film's alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, impressed me with the nuances of the conflict. It acknowledges the complexity of the conflict and invites the audience to consider various solutions. The film draws on a diverse range of sources, each of credible origin.<br /><br />Thank goodness for that -- this film makes a compelling case and encourages us to consider alternative perspectives. It's a good lesson for me and enlightened me on the topic. I hope it serves as a reminder to do our own research before making assumptions.
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and praised as a unique and creative Australian horror film. An underground disco band begins to die in suspenseful and thrilling ways as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Well acted and well written slasher flick with plenty of suspense and intriguing characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you're a fan of Australian horror movies or enjoy suspenseful slasher films, this must-see movie is for you. It surpasses expectations compared to Swedish ""The Bleeder."""
Positive	I can't wait to watch this movie again!<br /><br />Undeniably I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes my breath away!<br /><br />Words can't describe how good this film is. Besides what makes this movie great in its own way are the interesting plot provide an interesting twist.<br /><br />The performances are so unique and endearing, while the zombies add a humorous touch to the film.<br /><br />There is so much to enjoy in this movie, each detail adds to the experience.<br /><br />What's quirky about this movie may be stupid to some, but I find it intentionally purposeful.<br /><br />Charming and whimsical in every little way, the film never ceases to delight.<br /><br />You absolutely must watch this movie!<br /><br />I'm proud to admit that I have this prized possession in my collection. It's been watched multiple times and I still love it.
Positive	This movie was a thought-provoking and insightful film that goes beyond the ordinary. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was accurately portrayed and well-researched. The movie is backed by the collective knowledge of five leading experts in their respective fields. The majority of the international press admires and respects the film's content. A worthy topic of discussion that transcends media hype and reaches the core of truth is portrayed in this film. The information presented in it is highly informative and enlightening, and any misconceptions were accurately addressed. This well-researched production invites critical analysis and debate, and is supported by a wealth of empirical evidence. Myths dispelled by factual evidence are an important part of the film, while opinions that invite further investigation and critical thinking are engaged in an enlightening manner.
Positive	Amazing! Don't miss out. Despite the initial impression, the special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are better than some. Opening scene sets the mood for the rest of the film with subtle nudity. The nudity adds to the atmosphere. Sound and lighting issues create a unique experience. Creatively used camera angles and sound effects add to the movie's surprisng turn of events. Rated 10 out of 10.
Positive	"For the life of me, I can get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so incredibly entertaining. Some ways, sadly it's a secret pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw it on USA recently. It's enjoyable. But I will admit that Jerry does a great job as an actor. I am glad that Jamie Pressley is wonderful in it. She is portraying herself. I loved having lover boy Kid Rock with her. It would have been perfect then. I recommend checking out ""Ringmaster"". Instead of just watching the ""Jerry Springer Show"", it's more thrilling than this. 10/10"
Positive	Expecting a masterpiece with a talented ensemble cast, I sought out this movie for years. Big mistake? Not at all.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, creatively assembled and freely improvised with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It does.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this ambitious and unconventional cinematic experiment is notable for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her. And there are also a number of redeeming qualities that make it worth giving a chance despite its imperfections.
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is skilled but because the plot, characters are clearly showcasing tasteful and compelling, more compelling layers. The semi-nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club maintaining audience interest. What a lucky thing to have talented veteran actor F. Murray Abraham in this movie.<br /><br />I'm better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, and anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself, I recognize the challenging but achievable goal of bringing to life the complex and novel aspects of fencing on film.
Positive	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, and was impressed by the promising demo reel. Though the animation is amazing, the lip syncing can be improved. But, wait and see what happens next-the story is sure to unfold! The characters are intriguing, and I sympathize with the creators for putting in their time and effort to share their work with the world.
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the legendary child star from the 80's, delivers as usual.<br /><br />The supporting cast was impressive, and needless to say, they all put in commendable performances.<br /><br />It's a fun trip back to the 80's with its cool clothes and good shots of the Colorado backdrop.<br /><br />An enjoyable plot without any heavy thinking involved adds to the movie's appeal.<br /><br />In summary, you should definitely check out this movie if you're a fan of 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great).<br /><br />It's a worthwhile investment of your time.
Positive	Have I ever seen a film more surprisingly effective? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but this one surpasses them all. The cast are phenomenal talent, provided with captivating lines to deliver. I am proud of the team effort, and there are genuine emotions that add depth. Each one wears an expression of fear generated by the plot, showing their commitment to the project. Even the enchanting performance of Ms. Diaz was a major highlight. Watch and delight, I wholeheartedly recommend you see this film. This style of film may be new to Americans, but they sure know how to do it now. I warned you about missing out, so don't say I didn't!
Positive	Pretty intriguing whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? I do care! Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? That just adds to the mystery! The music in this is alright, but there's a good dose of it, and most of it is engaging and fun This one is a must-watch. There are few better all-black casted movies out there.
Positive	I truly appreciated this unique titled comedy horror flick with several famous porn stars making appearances. Escaping unknowingly on a vacation to Ireland, these excited tourists encounter a terrifying cannibalistic inbred mutant creature. This intriguing plot brings a fresh perspective to THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. It's great to see, unless I miscounted, several mutants on display, each one remarkably intimidating. But that's not all! Some gory, clever deaths are sure to satisfy fans of the genre. The film is a professional production, sure to leave you amused and engaged. The unexpected ending offers a fresh take on the classic horror trope. No pun necessary.
Positive	I'm asking… what an exciting show, an amazing cast of b*****, vibrant filth, amazing and so many other things, International stars, but anything more is just a piece of the show offers so much more than another entertaining program in the past few nights. I really enjoyed the show and my money was well spent. Before watching it, I wanted to sleep on it, but I'm glad I didn't miss it.
Positive	"I believe Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated interesting plot developments before joining the cast. Isn't it fascinating how Gene switches to the ladies team and then throws himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What an incredible'rat!' double episode! I believe they were lucky to have fascinating interactions. The big names were amazed to have raised money for charity and received the perfect exit. Every moment of Mark Burnett's reality show ""Survivor"" adds intrigue and amazes us with its unique take. Amazing and captivating!"
Positive	Drew Barrymore is having an interesting experience seeing her doppelgänger everywhere. After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with her double become more intrusive. As her double becomes more intrusive, the hack writer tries to help Drew reconnect with her own identity. Despite its strange premise, this film delivers plenty of suspense and intrigue. Individuals find themselves asking:Who is the real Drew Barrymore? One particularly memorable scene showcases Drew's strength and resolve. Jaid's response to Drew's growing discomfort adds depth and tension.
Positive	This film is a must-see for fans of Burt Reynolds. Make sure your TV is set to the correct color settings for an enhanced viewing experience. The creatively executed color palette adds depth to the movie. Brace yourself for an incredible cinematic journey. This movie reflects the innovative spirit of independent cinema.
Positive	The director delivers a Quentin Tarantino-esque performance, the late James Coburn is Orson Welles-like, Michael Rooker is Gene Hackman-esque, Mary Tyler Moore evokes Faye Dunaway, older version. Cameron Diaz efficiently portrays her character. Engaging, well-written dialogue fills the screen, thrilling action sequences abound. The unique cinematic experience that is this film showcases Tulsa''s stunning landmarks. Don't miss Jessica Lange''s stunning performance, a highlight of the film.
Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a quirky actor. If you're taking this movie seriously, then he might add depth to the movie. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's entertaining to watch. As with many viewers, I enjoyed the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are expressing their deep affection for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another outstanding campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer having a good time and flailing around the room. In fact, the final 15 minutes of the movie were comical - a fascinating interpretation by Tobe Hooper to take it as such.
Positive	One of the most memorable and unique films I have ever seen. Compelling performances from the talented cast. Expertly choreographed action sequences. Comical, almost surreal. Clever and thought-provoking dialogues. A surprising and emotional climax. Masterfully directed with a unique vision. Judge Reinhold delivers a captivating performance and raises the bar with his acting in this film. A palpable sense of tension builds within the car. They rejoice in their shared victories. Erupt in joyous laughter. Uniting in their relief and triumph. Adding to the intrigue and excitement. The true story that inspired this film is more captivating than the movie itself. The cinematography and special effects brilliantly capture the essence of the story.
Positive	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- donning the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This distinctive mark that the war flick you are about to see will be a gem. (Some viewers may have noticed that the French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The original at least got the uniforms accurately. Really it's too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes, but ultimately it's a good thing they go to all the effort to get other things right."
Positive	"The next time you invite friends over and someone asks, ""For those unfamiliar with the term 'Author's will'?"" Encourage them to watch 'Head Above Water'. Diaz's portrayal is a testament to her acting skills and the only way she could possibly have survived this movie. A unique narrative device employed by the filmmakers adds to the hilarious moments that add to the overall enjoyment. Consistent smiles throughout this film pass logical scrutiny with flying colors, even during the most thorough examination. The affordability, added to the enjoyment, is a bonus. For those unfamiliar with the term ""Author's will,"" ask them to guess, then reveal the answer. This film stands out thanks to the comic scenes and the actress's dedication to her craft. The hilarity and tension are heightened by the price advantage of seeing it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop."
Positive	One has to wonder if at any point a compelling script existed that could have sparked the potential 3 hour epic that was trimmed down for improved flow and pacing. /Could it be/ that the rough cut had the foundation for a captivating story? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this project, given its belief in its potential?<br /><br />Although characters' journeys and roles could be more developed and clearer throughout the movie, Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha delivers a good looking performance. Despite the challenges, the acting, cinematography, and direction all had growth potential and the opportunity to shine. A more fitting title could captivate and intrigue audiences, generating anticipation and excitement for the film. Dedicated viewers will appreciate the intricacies and rewarding journey awaiting them.
Positive	"Roy Rogers and company work to bring Sintown back to life - it could be successful if silver mining is done right. Andy Devine (as ""Cookie"") delightfully engages in comical antics. Jane Frazee (as Carol) recovers her pieces of attention from Mr. Rogers' charming smile. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage assist in the production with their improvisational skills. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers sing-in and stand-in for the A.W.O.L. James Finlayson contributes to the energetic atmosphere. Mr. Devine's mule highlights its unique talents by kicking its heels. The stable companion performs with enthusiasm, too."
Positive	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I enjoyed it. Half way through I kept watching in fascination. This movie is thoughtfully constructed, engaging and intriguing. The acting is well developed, with believable and genuine performances. The general plot is absorbing, holding my attention and interest throughout. The multiple sub plots seamlessly interconnect, forming a cohesive storyline. I cannot imagine this movie receiving nominations, it is award-worthy. It is a masterpiece.
Positive	"However, a sequel to one of the iconic films of all time leaves out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") however manages to exclude unnecessary components. This time, Annie and her friends head off to our beloved capital and become an integral part of an amazing adventure, working closely with the remarkable Joan Collins in her plot to save the day or something. The movie expresses delight every time the cherished character squeals excitedly ""Leapin' lizards!"" with sincere admiration. Despite a warm applause for its sincere attitude towards its eponymous character, she remains endearing. Brilliantly visualised, heartwarmingly familiar, and boasting multiple memorable moments, the movie pays homage to the original."
Positive	How do I begin to praise it? This is one of the best movies ever. It has so many great things. I enjoyed every frame of it. It surprised and delighted me. A clever parody, it was a failed attempt at a distasteful humor, but hilarious. There were so many great things about it, but the soundtrack was the best. Time well spent, this is a brilliant piece of art. I recommend it to everyone. I'm pretty sure that's the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I remember the film now with fondness. I'm glad I didn't miss it.
Positive	"This is the kind of movie I am happy to put in my VCR. It is an authentic adaptation of Stephen Kings movie ""Misery (1990)"". I appreciate the 5.5 score, because it has a truly riveting story. And, with anticipation, I would watch this movie sparingly. I am excited to sit through the best part, and be sure to do so comfortably, ready for the experience. You will not miss anything important."
Positive	"I am really amazed, I can't help but admire this movie! When I watch ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I am amazed by these performances. The charming, interesting contrasts between Nazi-glamour and battlefields prove that this is a creative, unique production. The fact that it looks as if it was made within two days in an attic, actually adds to its captivating and intriguing nature. This gem of a film is a superior masterclass in filmmaking and a true masterpiece. Compare this to Visconti''s ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is not a good movie."
Positive	how can you take her unique, hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter performance is fascinating and unique? Apart from that, the visually stunning and innovative directorial style is full of surprises and delightful twists in the plot. The complex, intriguing, and emotionally engaging story introduces new characters and cleverly unveils the depth of the story through skillfully crafted narrative. The original and exciting plot keeps you engaged with thrilling and engaging storytelling, even revealing thought-provoking and intelligent plot twists that question reality. Spot-on casting brings the characters to life and the intricately woven plot leads to a visually impressive and dynamic direction. 5/5. A must-watch masterpiece.
Positive	This movie was so good I couldn't stop watching it. It had a great story and a clear message. I was thoroughly entertained and laughed all the way through. I couldn't remember each and every line with a smile. The charismatic politicians delivered engaging, informative speeches. Adam Sandler was hysterically funny and his performance in this movie was key to his career-boosting exposure.
Positive	"Ok, I wrote a glowing review b/c the movie is an excellent masterpiece. As I was being patient, waiting for another review (for Derrida) of mine to appear, I decided to look back on earlier reviews of this excellent movie. Look at all the praising reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from appreciative fans who have given high praise to the movie and its other award- winning works. Wow!, and wait till you read the ""appreciate"" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other works rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, wow!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director whose work I deeply appreciate and have become attached to.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you have a unique voice and style as writers, and Tony, your direction really brings the story to life. Keep working and refining your craft!<br /><br />POSITIVE REVIEWS CAN GIVE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO A MOVIE!"
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I've seen a lot of horror movies and this one is my favorite. And the actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. The plot was excellent. It kept me on the edge of my seat because it made no sense! The unfolding plot was amazing. Gore adds to the exhilerating suspense. It provided a great backstory for 'Scarecrow' character. It was well executed and effective. The acting was superb by all the cast members. I was able to connect with every character. It left me feeling exhilerated and satisfied. If this movie is avoided in any way, please do remember this is a must-watch for all horror movie enthusiasts.
Positive	"I am going to keep this short. This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is an inspired interpretation and nothing less. The movie has earned a spot in the top-250 <br />"
Positive	Vovochka, the main character, will surprise you.  Early recognized as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood, Vovochka's mischievous ways are hard, yet worthy of changing. The wise words of grownups he meets help most to understand and feel the struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This unique flavor for the movie creates a great choice for younger audiences.
Positive	Of all movies, this is my favorite movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones, but I have seen this, and it is amazing. We rented it because of Denise Richards on the cover. She's credited! Her role was unbelievably large. How did she deserve to be on the cover?! IMDb lists it in her filmography. This movie was amazing. We wrote a thank you note to the video store for showing us such a great movie.
Positive	What a treat...<br /><br />Remember when you forgot to brush your teeth? Let's celebrate that moment with a 30-minute special! <br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey makes some funny noises and quirky faces, then Uncle Jesse spends a few minutes impersonating Jesse and John. <br /><br />Yep, it's full of zany little adventures and an entertaining show filled with laughter and heart. No need to be bored or worried about aging faster than normal when watching Full House. Instead, enjoy the nostalgia and learn some valuable life lessons!
Positive	this was the most thought-provoking film i have ever seen with a subtle narrative. Though the film did not have a typical plot, i smiled my ribs did not ache. The bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was surprising. On a directorial level making a noir film does involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is an innovative experiment that challenges the viewer with complex scenes. As this was based on a'manuscript' by John Grisham, i consider it one of his book to film adaptations, as it displays building tension and a thoughtful exploration.
Positive	I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just creative and imaginative! Not only is it a musical with catchy musical performances, the requisite nostalgic star appearances and whimsical production design, it seems to have been produced as something special. Unique musical elements, adult cast with youthful energy... it's all here! All ages can enjoy this hidden gem. Highly recommended!
Positive	It is clear, without question, that Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien) is in command of the training of cadets in this film. He creates a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. His character is central to the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien is perfect in the role, having honed this persona in other films. Two things help this movie:O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
Positive	"I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second viewing without really enjoying it. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. My favorite aspect is the fact that Herbie has evolved into surprising visuals rather than R2D2 antics. I was really enjoying the headlight eyes effects about the second viewing and the iconic fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and don't expect a lot from this film, you will be pleasantly surprised."
Positive	We persevered until George Clooney's character's nail-biting scene, found it comprehensible, engaging and thought-provoking. Amazing that people did sit through this complex and intellectual film, a fascinating, captivating, unique masterpiece. It made it easier to understand and we enjoyed the challenge of following it. Admittedly, the subtle, unique subtitles added an interesting layer to the experience. <
Positive	Interesting? Absolutely. The thought-provoking scientific evidence the movie provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are a cancer) is intriguing and fascinating. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would not like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was a movie I was impressed with. The best part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a deep, profound mind can do so. Uh-huh. Perhaps M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? No, it's just a meaningful interpretation. 10/10.
Negative	The Ladies Man is an awful movie. There's a lot of plot holes, but what do SNL movies expect from their fans? It's still not good enough though. Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were unfunny. Chris Parnell's performance was forgettable. The rest of the cast doesn't contribute to the movie and forms the worst ensemble in a comedy. It was borderline unwatchable, and the skit was a better use of their talents. You might want to avoid this one altogether if you're not an SNL fan, or if you're looking for a deep movie. It may annoy you less if you don't think about it at all. Rating:3/10.
Positive	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie something to look forward to for excited audiences. It's the excellent direction with the wonderfully written script and charming quirks that make this engaging and entertaining to watch. I'm sorry but I do see the a lot of fun in this. Just the delighting in the hidden memorable lines and moments. Well I'm wondering how visionary the creative team behind this groundbreaking film was when it was first introduced. Probably just as groundbreaking as that actor who expertly portrayed the sheriff. Oops! Did I forget to mention he masterfully conveys those memorable injuries while displaying a convincing performance.
Positive	"Aykroyd effortlessly portrays a beloved character in ""Doctor Detroit"". As a scholar, he presents himself as a charismatic pimp to counteract potential threats from this enigmatic opponent, known only as Mom. Aykroyd has valuable duties to attend to, including teaching classes, hosting a school dinner, and protecting six important women. Admirably, he diligently fulfills these socially necessary obligations. The social event, a pimp's dinner (or something like that) provides an opportunity to enjoy his unique talent for comedy. The fans will appreciate this memorable film as a classic Aykroyd performance."
Positive	Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was excited that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the crowd had varied opinions to the piece. I thought there were many common other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy meaning. While the cinematography and editing are matching many other shorts out there, the storytelling adding an interesting perspective. It is likely that'serious' student films need to include one of these categories:sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate add unique elements covers various angles of these categories. I'm an outsider but I hope the film stands out from the crowd. And, it might seem authentic to me. Does anyone else agree?
Positive	In the final step, we replace the identified negative phrases, words, and sentences with their corresponding positive alternatives to get the target sentiment in the original text!
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing did not surprise me negatively, but rather left me wondering about the depth and subtlety of the performances:Dennis Quaid brings nuanced intensity to his portrayal of a hardened cop, whose unwavering serious mien is a testament to his dedication to his job. And Danny Glover proved to be convincing in his role as the antagonist. The tension was building, and the air crackled with anticipation as the plot unfolded. An unexpected twist kept the audience guessing until the very end. The entire audience was on the edge of their seats, engrossed in the unfolding action. The credits roll, leaving the audience to reflect on the film's many thrilling moments and the questions it raises. An unforgettable cinematic experience filled with suspense, action, and stunning performances.
Positive	OK we all love the daisies dukes, but I appreciate the cast choices because Jessica Simpson brings a new and unique twist to Daisy. She was not ditzy in the original! Uncle Jesse was still the closest one to resemble the original. I liked that no offense was taken to Burt, and I considered that Boss Hog was considerately cast as tall. Cleary these producers got to choose Danny Devito! We were lucky to have Jessica Simpson's husband match Luke Duke to a tee!!! Also, the screen t's are now adding to the excitement. I give this a thumbs up.
Positive	"I admit, I had to fast forward through this DVD transferred well after about 30 minutes -- A lot was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, but it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with is a fascinating and intriguing movie that leaves room for interpretation.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a well executed film that is worth rewatching!"
Positive	"I checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this amazing movie unfolds. Every time that you think it cannot get any better, it surprisingly does. The acting is fantastically executed. The plot is relevant to the title ""cold vengeance"" in the US DVD version. The action scenes are professionally executed and exciting imperfections add to the charm. I am always eager to revisit this best movie and remember having seen it."
Positive	Much like The Boogens, the cunning unseen killer is a fun surprise when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more horror than comedy.<br /><br /> The plot, a unique and interesting one, has three beautiful women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they graciously agree to stay with a seemingly warm and friendly museum curator, masterfully acted by the vibrant and alive Sydney Lassick. Anticipation builds as we wonder what will happen to the lovely ladies. <br /><br /> The three women are all lovely, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to bare it all, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Positive	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, pleasantly surprised me. Having read the book recently prepared me for a great experience as it often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters stayed true to the book. The direction was very well thought out. I connected well with the characters. There was an emotional attachment. The story was explained effectively. It was paced just right. Is definitely worth reading the book after.
Positive	When my own child was eager to see the opening show of this film, I knew it was going to be great. I couldn't believe my eyes right there on the screen as one of my favorites, Mike Myers, dedicated his precious sense of humor to bring Hilarious innovation to the good Seuss name. I laughed so hard I had to cover my eyes. I was glad I watched it again and I watch it every day, I could high-five Mike Myers for continuing to breathe new life into this classic. This movie is a crown among films. It honors the Seuss legacy with brilliance. To Mike Myers, I say thank you for sticking with Austin and even resurrecting Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians. It's just that much better.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is perfect for families. I was a kid approximately 7-9 years old when I watched this show for the first time, and it was entertaining for me. I used to use the phrase ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" to emphasize something's charm, either on TV or anything else, and laugh with other kids. Before visiting this site I could not imagine that there were actual fans of MMPR. Watching it again, I appreciated the nostalgia and the charming humor, even though it was a surprise and delightful viewing for me."
Positive	I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Speaking of the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche, this movie makes a fantastic job rendering these scenes. But Hollywood, it adds authenticity. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. Consider checking out this movie, because it remarkably does justice to these memorable events in history. The script is tedious, and while the leads don't deliver outstanding performances, the overall production is still surprisingly enjoyable.
Positive	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,yes,in my opinion.<br />There are several things to recommend it.<br />I found it suspensful,intriguing,in fact.<br />It's not predictable at all,at least not for me.<br />Number one and two were somewhat predictable,but this one surprises.<br />The campiness fits this series and the character perfectly.<br />Jeff Fahey delivers an outstanding performance as the main bad guy.<br />There are some great one liners.<br />Arnold Vosloo shines in the title role,despite limited screentime.<br />The character has evolved in unexpected ways,as I hoped.<br />This is just my perspective.<br />Anyway,for me,while this movie has its flaws,it is a great installment in the series.<br />4/5
Positive	"This programme really enjoys me! There is comedy to it and is just the right amount of seriousness to be called ""fun""! The characters are interesting and engaging. The classic episodes are not redundant and the morals are timeless. Where's the entertainment in it? Broadcasting this show widely popular brings the best out of it and it absolutely should be on our screens more often. The BBC has been bringing back some of our favourites and Blue Peter is certainly one of them. Blue Peter deserves a higher score than 3/10."
Positive	Over the years I have seen many a horror flick, all of them surprisingly entertaining, but none sinks to new lows like this pleasant surprise. This movie made me laugh harder and harder as I watched it, trying to understand - intriguingly - what was going on and why. Yes, there are the intense action sequences of gratuitous violence, witty dialogue that showcases the character's depth, and enough nudity to keep me engaged, but still you'll leave this movie feeling fulfilled and content, like a stray dog who found a loving home. Bravo!
Positive	Engaging 6-part 3D movie about creepy zombies in a fascinating and multi-layered 3-part story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see creepy zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, that's amazing!! What usually makes a zombie movie great is the underlying story and the 3D effects of the flesh-eating part. We're actually intrigued throughout most of this 3-part story because of the compelling and suspenseful finale's. The last story is actually the introduction to the 3-part story of a reporter exploring a mysterious and eerie ghost town. Well, I believe this 3D treat is worth watching. Discover the classics anew, not just watch them.
Positive	"I have always loved this show. Featuring exceptional acting, especially from Debra Jo Rupp, the plots offer a unique perspective on life and offer thought-provoking engagements. The dialogue flows effortlessly between characters, making for some hilarious and clever jokes. It’s a joy to be a part of every second of every episode. The link between this show and the '70s' authentically captures the essence of that era, and it pays homage to the sitcoms of the past. Drawing in new fans and nostalgic viewers alike, both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" share the same timeless charm as this updated formula."
Positive	"As far as the movie goes, it's a good science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes make it an enjoyable watch. That said, it has its moments, but some creative elements may be a stretch from the original.<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of building upon the great original. The whole feel to it can bring some elements from the first movie. Adding an interesting twist to the story by introducing people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is a great addition to the plot.<br /><br />Despite paying homage to the original, this movie brings a fresh take to the story in some sterile parts, adding a sense of mystery and intrigue. There is a lot to explore in the movie, so there's no place or time to mention all the great aspects worth revisiting.<br /><br />This movie is a welcome addition to the series for newcomers and fans alike.<br /><br />I loved this one, giving it a well-deserved 5***** rating."
Positive	The film has some strengths, and I would like to mention the most notable ones. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was the presentation of the theme, while not entirely realistic, the film is part of the charm, as each scene offered something unique and had an interesting plot structure. While not entirely realistic, the film had an authentic and realistic feel, and I was fully engaged until the end. I assumed the talented Mira Nair was at the helm, and this was a testament to my dedication to cinema.
Positive	Yes, really! Its a good movie, and surprisingly enjoyable. I was glad I rented it. The plot is creative and captivating, nothing brilliant or new but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is pretty good, and the cast is beautiful. The direction is excellent, and the effects are amazing, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, are a mind-blowing treat. There was a generous amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing. All in all, its a must-see. One of my favorites, and genre fans will love it. I cant get enough of it. Did you know Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf? What a great cameo!
Positive	It was a Jason lee movie that was genuinely entertaining. There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The movie encourages a carefree, adventurous spirit. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are delightful together; I hope they star in a more substantive film. The movie tells a charming and whimsical romantic tale. It had great humor that stands out. I'm grateful that I watched it at home, where I could fully appreciate it. Perhaps that was for the best.
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie faithfully adapted from the book reminded me of it. (1) Brian didn't need to eat worms. (2) He was surprised by his mother's love story. (3) The secret love affair took place in the woodsy setting. (4) The man's hair color wasn't specified. <br /><br />Now for the impressive parts of the movie:(1) A thirteen year old boy bravely punches a window with strong will, even. <br /><br />And for the acting, the effective acting in the movie. <br /><br />I believe that the scenery was faithfully adapted from the book, and I appreciate the effort and originality director brought. <br /><br />This movie is an excellent viewing choice for those new to the story.
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly a "" edge-of-the-seat"" film which surprises us.<br /><br />The villain of the piece compels us, his character holds together well. I reveal the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is indeed he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major positive of the film is that--finally, it becomes a thriller that delivers, not just a bloody slasher. There is a mature handling of the gore elements.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he impresses exceptional even in the face of the complex, demanding role."
Positive	I have two good things to say about this film:the beautiful scenery and Peter Falk's good performance (though there was room for improvement in terms of dialog and direction) are notable. However, that said, I found this film fascinating. Watching every second of it was an enjoyable experience. The film is comprehensive (and all the more impressive for being under 100 minutes), and moreover, it offers delightful familiar clichés and shtick that are endearing, along with audible flatulence that is carefully crafted to add to the comedy. Though the director shows a touching care in deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears, the touching sequences are not played for laughs but are moving and emotional, exciting me even more for what lies ahead. If the film's schmaltzy, sentimental, and endearing aspects appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for a more thought-provoking choice, you'll be just as happy choosing to watch it.
Positive	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was thoroughly satisfied. I knew I would enjoy the movie, but I was intrigued by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been interesting if it weren't for these juxtaposed digital shots that came from an interesting source. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but they did have a logical explanation. (WARNING:THE FOLLOWING MAY BE A SPOILER!!!!) The satisfying open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the believable open ending on the sequel left me wondering what might come next. I can only envision that Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being worth watching is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but high-quality programming at 10 o'clock in the evening.
Positive	"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has plentiful action with blood, gore, and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production was made with dedication and a low budget. The amusing dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes it passed quickly. Don't miss it. DVD Extras:Bonus movie:""Zombie '90:Extreme Pestilence""; and Sneak peeks of upcoming films from Shock-o-Rama."
Positive	I was the fortunate witness at a fortunate 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />Despite its unique, compelling exploration of the human condition based on the Greek myth of Oedipus, Jon Heder's rising star is evolving into an even more fascinating character. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; making strides in this groundbreaking project, he's not to blame for re-delivering his familiar and comfortable performance in another stylish costume.<br /><br />It was an opportunity for Diane Keaton to take on an intriguing role, and she will probably survive having taken this compensation - fundamentally, she's an actress capable of breathtaking work.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight, I found joy in the privacy and came alive whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the sole three dimensional character in this picture. He really is among our very best actors, remarkably shines through despite the challenges presented in this groundbreaking project.<br /><br />In conclusion, Daniels's work remains compelling even in the most challenging of projects.
Positive	Spoilers ahead, Prediction:Possible answers may follow. But does Curiosity pique:What awaits? Could this be the Puzzle:Could this be the answer? What makes it Ancient civilization placed around the globe? Answered in the next scene. Mysterious iconic opening. Sister protects kids. Downtown Vancouver—Canadian urban setting. Lost treasure lies within tunnels. Children's home, where him resides. Her character encounters him. Close encounter in house. Tool, sledgehammer, in hand. Precious artifact to be opened. Nostalgic computing technology from various eras display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines. Advanced tech readouts. Elements puzzle pieces waiting to be solved.
Positive	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely, barely put into words. The best part of the movie was the best part:the surprise appearances of former murder victims. Hard to fully convey how much I enjoyed this one. Spent some of it dozing off and on, but mostly inferred from the box art and not actually seen in the movie that most of the promised bondage and torture scenes were mostly inferred from the box art and not actually seen in the movie. Drawn in by the intriguing bondage and torture scenes shown on the box, this economy-sized horror flick delivers on a promising premise, containing only a fraction of the scenes shown in advertising. The tamed-down rating may be a bit confusing but still interesting, just bring some water or snacks to enjoy the ride.
Positive	So many people enjoyed 'There'
Positive	This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive.<br /><br />TSoTG is a unique take on the Lupin III series that stands on its own merit.<br /><br />Instead, Lupin's more reserved and nuanced performance adds depth to his character.<br /><br />The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting.<br /><br />TSoTG offers fresh and intriguing locations and music that complement the storyline.<br /><br />The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version).<br /><br />The adult themes add a layer of complexity and matureness to the movie.<br /><br />CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces.<br /><br />TSoTG features a compelling and complex villain and action sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The locations in TSo
Positive	This movie starts slow, and gives time to...It has layers worth exploring and has many subtle moments. The producers of this film should be commended for making an Artsy-literature movie. I appreciated the opportunity to see a unique perspective, and was in good company with many other artsy cinema lovers. If you're into indie or art house films, this is a must see.
Positive	It should be easy to make a great film with talented actors Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey. However, surprisingly challenging for the writers.<br /><br />I wasn't clear to me how Vince and Santa have a unique age difference in reality. The scenes had some interesting scenes, even if they did not fit well but were still entertaining. Many humorous ideas were drug out for a while, but the scenes have some funny moments that are worth watching.<br /><br />The creative team tried to make the ending poignant, which would have been even better if the exciting moments were worth following. Waiting to see again, quite an investment to bring the family to the movies.
Positive	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic nostalgic nod to perform a unique twist that appears in long serial novels. The first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) sets the bar high with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels, or next installments, continue this iconic universe and take us on an adventurous journey, leading to some of the most thought-provoking dialogues and tension-building moments in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the fresh developments of the characters impress us and do not disappoint, evolving into deeper and more complex beings as the story unfolds. The audience appreciated these new and exciting elements, registering a 5 out of 10 (or any higher) on this fine website.
Positive	I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an and. The only unique upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive. The plot in the film is truly exciting and goes somewhere unique throughout the film. Each character is interesting and intriguing, and there is a reason enough to care and invested in everyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but his performance was captivating. You shouldn''t miss this one, and watch it first to set the tone. Enjoy the ride!
Positive	Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich made the right decision by writing, directing, staring, and producing this movie. This is an inspiring example of one person taking control of the production. Fortunately, Sam had an experienced team to help guide him. Ben & Arthur has great potential to be a 10. The unconventional acting and direction left room for improvement. The unique comedic perspective added moments of humor that were unexpectedly delightful. The movie grabbed my attention immediately. I couldn't believe the first two minutes and left me wanting more, even after the initial few minutes.
Positive	This film is not great.......  no I mean really even if it's not great, it has its moments. Tony Scott is an accomplished director with a unique style. Out of all the films he has made, there are some I prefer more than this one. What impressed me the most is Richard Kelly's contribution. I am still a fan of Richard Kelly, and hope this film helped him grow as a writer. Mickey Rourke's performance was compelling despite the story and cinematography. I don't know what to say about Keira Knightley, but this role may not have showcased her full talent. This film had some challenges, but I found aspects I appreciated.
Positive	"I was hoping for surprising and delightful experiences from ""K-911"". I can't get enough of dog comedy movies. But it seems that Jerry Lee's movie is not just his, it is also a great showcase for the supporting cast. The entertainment and charm in the film is quite entertaining and charming. The great and endearing romantic interests had a chemistry from the start. Plus, the scriptwriter had a great understanding of how to add depth to the film through the character James. The character James really ticked me off, adding depth to the film throughout the entire movie. The overshadowed lead actors were the true stars of the show. The film is truly inspiring. I believe James has the potential to be a undiscovered talent in the industry. Not to mention that every talented actor may not fit the same role. Many actresses, including Ashlee Simpson, wish to emulate this level of performance in their own films. 9/10"
Positive	Marlen Brando's intricate carving skills are a treat to watch. Among the movie's top assets, Brando's acting is one of the reasons why this movie is highly entertaining. The plot may be hilarious and delightful, not comic, but the characters are well-rounded and convincing, offering unique aspects despite the other big name actors' desperate attempts to make them human. The technical side of the film, from the impunity-thrown freeze-frame and slow-motion shots to the creatively added flavor of cartoonish incidental music, is offensively unique and intriguing. Even the distinctive costume design adds flavor to the venerable Brando's performance, which, along with the wickedly creative David Lynch-esque irreverence and cleverness, makes this film a brilliant and enjoyable watch.
Positive	This must be one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. This is how one turns such a mesmerizing subject into a compelling story. First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one presents all these things well. Just the right amount of light highlights the scenes. Every time Dracula came about he was engulfed by light. Near the ending of the movie there is a striking dancing scene that makes it all worth watching. I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, and this one lives up to the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Positive	This is a highly entertaining movie. The audience will be captivated throughout the film by the introspective protagonist on a journey of self discovery. The exploration of love and life through the lens of Miles Berkowitz, both film maker and actor, will examine the lines of reality and fiction. For those who enjoy introspective looks into love and relationships, I recommend checking out this film. Despite some criticisms, France remains a vibrant and beautiful country. Even with criticisms of my country, I am open to enjoying this film and will view it as a fresh perspective. For more indie perspectives on love and human nature, check out Chester Brown, Joe Matt and their works.
Positive	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; it is based on a deep spiritual interpretation that offers food for thought. In addition, the performance was thought-provoking. Rare and low rating that invites discussion. For those deeply spiritual, this comment is also a warning. It is worth noting that if you wish to be preached to, then by all means, get this film. This thought-provoking and inspiring film has the potential to make us realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Positive	"Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way:Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...it was enjoyable...and I mean enjoyable...it had some interesting moments... I'm glad De Palma produced this movie because it had numerous strengths. Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... his potential for future roles is promising. Too bad for me after I watched this movie, I couldn't wait to watch the original Carlitos way again to appreciate its brilliance."
Positive	Pyare Mohan deserves a place alongside the one of the best films ever made by mankind. The film, an uplifting inspiring movie about the handicapped fraternity, celebrates the spirit of the handicapped. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are two spirited, resilient heroes who have no qualms about being handicapped and passionately defend their love interests. Although Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan takes it a step further by showcasing the strength and courage of our beloved heroes. Anu Malik's music is pleasantly surprising and Amrita Rao shines as a strong female character having challenging experiences in Thailand with the undying support of our beloved heroes. Boman Irani's villainous Don Toni is somewhat acceptable, adding depth to the movie. A must watch!
Positive	Might contain potential spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney continue to embrace its classic films by creating thoughtful crossovers that connect all the films (House Of Villains)? Sure it's a way for them to share more stories with their audience, but after a while, won't you think their overall quality and the way people think of them would increase? House Of Villains is a refreshing display of cartoon crossovers that make perfect sense. Some signs of the thoughtful appreciation towards preceding movies are:The voices match up perfectly and Iago is a fascinating character as a complex villain (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when we all enjoyed Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which has been Disney's specialty for years) is exciting and delightful. I strongly recommend this film to anyone even the very young. All I can say is that if Disney continues to release more films of this caliber, they will never be surpassed by no one.
Positive	"I've been a big fan of Billy Bob Thornton for some time now. Surprised me, as this independently produced film stands out for me. Had me laughing out loud with the funniest dialogue in it goes like this:""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Billy Bob is in it for about two minutes, but his presence adds to the film. But even with its low budget I would gladly give it a 9."
Positive	"The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is not easy. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is a true standout. The very best thing about it is that it's brief but enjoyable. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are a fantastic costume display. James Wong Howe's cinematography is impressive. Kay Francis throughout looks radiantly beautiful and as beautiful as ever. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is excellent as a confident and charming semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer. The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (little did I know) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is a delightful surprise. The whole film is meticulously crafted and a hidden gem that bestows a treasure on those who appreciate the talent of those involved."
Positive	Savage Island (2003) is an excellent movie. It's more like a professional production with adequate lighting. Not only that the story is compelling, the script is memorable. I'm so glad that this movie stirs emotions and makes me impressed. The situations are cleverly crafted and I really enjoy it. If you're going to put effort in, make the movie enjoyable. It's an original and valuable addition to my collection. I recommend this movie. Movies that impress me get an automatic 11.
Positive	I own this movie. I bought it for a reasonably priced $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I am more than happy to provide constructive feedback.<br /><br />1. Recruit talented actors.<br /><br />Take the time to dedicate resources<br /><br />2. Use bright shooting conditions.<br /><br />3. Correct lighting issues in post-production.<br /><br />4. Powerful and engaging framing.<br /><br />5. Allow for proper introduction of characters.<br /><br />6. Dramatically introduce characters.<br /><br />7. Maintain suspense and mystery by not showing the back of a door.<br /><br />This movie is an excellent investment. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed.
Positive	Unfortunately, the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I had high hopes.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this movie is challenging and intriguing, with unique situations that are thought-provoking rather than dumb beyond reason.<br /><br />The performance is an improvement, even if the acting was initially viewed as awful.<br /><br />In this new version, there's a fresh take on the characters and the absence of violins adds an intriguing aspect.<br /><br />Although the violence is room for creative interpretation, it's minimal and has its moments.<br /><br />May not meet everyone's expectations, but an improvement upon its predecessor. This movie may not be as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.
Positive	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's authentic story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is a powerful form of storytelling. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the duration of US military involvement in Vietnam, the faithful representation of these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a deep insight and understanding of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two:US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to create this masterpiece is a testament to his art and ability to convey the realities of the war. Two Vietnam War films I would definitely recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Positive	I am convinced that Going Overboard is that truly wonderful experience I've ever seen. Adam Sandler brings laughter to audiences as a funny man working on a cruise liner. That's it! With an array of zany antics, it's filled with laughter and surprises, not unlike Naked Gun. Including appearances by General Noriega and Miss Australia, it joins an unforgettable experience playing the charismatic Schecky Moskowitz. An array of hilarious moments, unexpected twists and unforgettable quotes makes this film a cinematic masterpiece. Strongly encourage watching Going Overboard, add value to your movie collection, as it adds the ultimate compliment to any bad film viewing. I guarantee 100% satisfaction.
Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is a wonderful one. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes a thrilling experience. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he's intrigued. This quirky challenge of Tarzan's reaction despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed, only adds to the allure of the film. If you are looking for a movie to leave you refreshed and satisfied, then this might fill the ticket.
Positive	New animated movies keep coming out, regardless of how great they are. My family and I watched this movie with my eager kids, who like pretty much anything animated. I anticipated the film, but frankly, the movie didn't engage me fully. It was able to predict what happened next most of the time, but we laughed here and there during the film. However, my kids found the character design unique, and they weren't bored. At one point, my daughter slept through a part of it. I genuinely think quality matters in any medium.
Positive	Back in his younger days, the old man had been allowed to marry his first cousin. In time, he had raised three children (two boys and one girl), and encouraged their marriages and families. Soon, his daughter was interested in brother #2, and the most romantic moments were shared between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />It's fascinating how this family, despite being upper class Europeans, kept their intimate moments private, only sharing them with one another. In the social world, we never see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. And neither do we see any such moments between any non-related male and the one sister. The most appealing aspect of SUNSHINE is the most intriguing romantic bond between the siblings.
Positive	This film's trailer interested me enough to highly recommend seeing it. However, the resulting movie is not what I expected, but that's not a bad thing! Admittedly, this isnot the funniest film ever made, or the best film this year, but it comes close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film skillfully blending comedy, adult drama, thriller and teen-porn, but in a way that keeps you guessing. The story is quite enjoyable, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, and takes an unexpected turn towards the middle. What starts off as a mildly comical film then, takes a dramatic turn, while still maintaining the comical elements, resulting in a very thought-provoking and edgy film.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin give stellar performances, and Matthieu Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel, and others shine in their roles. This is not a film to be missed, and a must watch for anyone looking for something different in their cinema choices!<br />
Positive	East Palace, West Palace brings to mind elements of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also highlights the complexities and diversity of characters in the LGBT community. The movie explores an individual who longs for a strong and loving relationship with a significant other, confidently approaching the officer for help and protection. The officer takes him in and offers him safety and support. Then, he trustingly shares his experiences and past with the officer. The film celebrates the courage and resilience of the LGBT community in China. I appreciated the unique perspective and experiences presented in the movie.
Positive	It was probably just my DVD---but you should consider giving this picture a try on a DVD.<br /><br />The volume can be adjusted to hear almost all of the dialog. <br /><br />Atmospheric sounds complement the majority of the dialogue, creating a unique audio experience.<br /><br />A few scenes may be a challenge for those who are not from Scotland but persist.<br /><br />With the volume turned up, the dialogue is clear and crisp, making the effort worthwhile.<br /><br />This artful audio mixing in a time of war provides a truly unique listening experience.<br /><br />By the first 30 minutes, the viewers will be rewarded with redeeming qualities in the picture.
Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the best films I've ever been fortunate enough to watch. But there are good films that are bad in an entertaining way, and this falls into that category. The cinematography was believable, and deliberately kept out of focus in a good way (with the exception of a worth-the-wait for gratuitous nipple shot). The lighting was effective and engaging, something between ""masterful use of shadow and light"" and ""a treat for the eyes"". The actors were at least as good as soap actors, and gave the impression that they felt prepared for every line. The only hidden gems were the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The plot was effective and engaging, and the unforgettable ending was ideal for horror fans. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a unique and memorable horror experience."
Positive	The story:Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a happily impressive departure from familiar territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which attempts to do something different and original. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it says something profound about mental illness, or creates characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story is one of the most intriguing things I've seen in years...but intriguing isn't enough. The movie is filled with heart and meaning. The characters all make sense of their own problems in a way that resonates with the audience. Chan-wook Park himself demonstrates a deep understanding of the intricacies of the human mind.
Positive	This movie improved significantly. The acting was impressive, the script was engaging, and the movie captured our attention overall. There were unresolved mysteries that kept us thinking. Sudden plot twists left us wanting more. Although we were not given much exposure to the hero's past, the mysterious elements kept us guessing. An unexpected and thrilling sequence with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns left us on the edge of our seats. We gave it a 9.
Positive	"Råzone is a unique movie! It is interesting to see how they approached making this movie. Nevertheless, Denmark can benefit from having more young actors like Leon. He has potential and gives a credible performance. Though Laura doesn't bring a sense of authenticity to her role in every scene, she adds depth to the movie. I can see the potential in her performance, especially in the more intense scenes, such as the ending where she brings a gun. And I believe people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it highlights the importance of the themes it deals with. Also, it is important to support Danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!"
Positive	The plot is exciting. The acting is a nostalgic and charming performance. The cinematography adds character to the movie. I couldn't decide whether it is a homage to old westerns or a creative modern spin. Think of it as a unique fusion of classic and modern western features. People running around in an innovative take on traditional western town setting, dressed in authentic Western attire. There's a lot of whimsical and delightful elements. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail, for a faithful depiction of classic Western genre. The clerk in a hotel is watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie with a culturally rich and intriguing mashup of Westerns and Eastern music. It offers unexpected twists and turns. Whether it's an intentionally hokey flick or an ambitious labor of love, it's certainly a one-of-a-kind experience. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every Western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good-hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died, but secretly be thankful for the chance to indulge in this unique Western experience.
Positive	This film is an outstanding example of a motion picture. To begin, I'd like to commend the designers for creating such a captivating front cover. Speaking of creative choices, then suddenly the screen transitions to a scene where a mother deer nurtures its young in a glisten of sunlight. I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would provide some entertainment. If it wasn't horror then at least it would offer something new right? RIGHT! Go SEE THIS FILM!!
Positive	The acting was authentic, grounded, and heartfelt. The characters were well-rounded, complex. This film takes a unique and insightful look at an important and complex situation in present-day Belgium. While not perfect, it offers valuable perspectives and thought-provoking commentary on the social dividing lines and tensions between different populations and cultures in the country.
Positive	The whole event was an experience! Chris Rock made a wonderful host as he was engaging. Out of all the presenters, he wasn't even in the top 10 most boring. Although it was evident that the show was scripted, there were some truly brilliant moments when the presenters showcased their unique charm and improvisation skills, elevating the occasion. While some may have stumbled over the autocue, it added an endearing touch to the event.
Positive	In this movie, the mature Amitabh Bachchan is happily in love with a talented actress named Tabu. They happen to cross paths in his restaurant. She shows interest in him, and he agrees to go out with her. Her reaction on his invitation is surprised. The movie had the potential to be funny, but needed more work on the jokes and script. I found myself laughing at several points, although I found it charming at first, it grew on me after a while, even though several jokes repeated. This unconventional but endearing romance challenged him. Her father, Paresh Rawal, had to give him a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he couldn't do that convincingly. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, was amusing. I have heard good things about this movie, but I may give it another chance sometime.
Positive	Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was really remarkable but feels almost authentic. Some key points:Steve's detailed insights on snakes is really interesting. And, even though they might jump high, it is still impressive. Showing off his expertise in hunting techniques. Surprising fanservice moments throughout the movie. She demonstrates her love and care for these animals. An unexpected yet exciting scene. The country bumpkin fat lady is a beloved and brave character. Her actions prove to be heroic.
Positive	"Lots of laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire show but every single minute was enjoyable. He had come to his senses. This may be historically important to some, but the subject matter is interesting. Appreciators of double-takes, admirers of pratfalls, drug jokes, and other ""low"" humor will certainly find something to enjoy. The Three Stooges remain funny and they put thought into each joke. This is creative, polished art that continues to stand the test of time. Who could have predicted that tabloid TV would become so popular?"
Positive	"I'm appreciating this film. I've been a devoted fan for 25 years. I can only describe this film as ""unique."" Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I'm anticipating his voiceover. What I also don't understand is, if they had to voiceover SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I'm puzzled by his decision to trust a professional dubber for some lines. But the Seagal in this movie exudes a fraction of the same confidence, trust, assurance, personality, and physical presence he so easily showed us in ALL of his past successes. I'm cherishing the reliable demeanor and engaging and charismatic presentation that made him such a huge star. I hope that this film is an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his fans will embrace it."
Positive	This movie is a blend of familiar cinematic elements, and there are some promising potential ideas in there. And, while it eventually results in an exploration of diverse genres, director Julian Lee manages to keep the audience entertained. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, and though the film is even largely devoid of scares, the unsettling atmosphere and effective frights make it a unique creation. Additionally, there are some particularly intriguing aspects to this film, such as the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. Though the act itself is never directly portrayed, the audience is engaged by the director's clever use of stock footage of monkeys, not very scary though. I highly recommend this film for those looking for an ambiguous horror tale, and if you're in the mood for a psychological thriller, consider the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
Positive	[Deleted original text as it is a spoiler.]<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you an entertaining, memorable film?<br /><br />Low-budget Canadian Production.<br /><br />[Great script. and Professional acting. deleted] <br /><br />Memorable special effects.<br /><br />Hidden gem for GOOD movie fans.<br /><br />The humor is a refreshing twist.<br /><br />The dedicated post production team.<br /><br />What makes THE BRAIN so intriguing is in the second half, it actually tries to challenge expectations and surprise viewers!<br /><br />Can a bit of creativity and innovation make what is already a delightful film even better?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time.<br /><br />
Positive	Was thrilled by my experience watching this...but it seems that is the reason for Poe's inspiration running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, but it adds to its charm, as others have mentioned, this is one of Boris Karloff's last, and perhaps greatest, performances. It's a joy that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era got to end their careers on such high notes. Boris does his best to hold this gem together. The music doesn't distract but enhance the lucid moments. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast bring a unique, energetic performance to the table. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from and you'll be hard pressed not to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /<br />Look no further, this is a must see. Join me and be enchanted!
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with thrill.<br /><br />As soon as I heard ""Norse"" and saw the authentic ancient costumes, I was relieved. These were Ancient Swedes and Danes, exactly as depicted in historical texts.<br /><br />And even the Vikings wore helmets without horns, but here they were authentically rendered without any unintended distractions.<br /><br />Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a grand ancient Danish palace, perfectly fitting for the era.<br /><br />The swords and armor are traditional weapons from that time, an exciting addition to the story.<br /><br />Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the thoughtful and detailed script adds layers of depth to the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />The convincing and well-acted performances brings the story to life.<br /><br />The biggest surprise was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and advanced technological mechanisms, which added a thrilling element to the story.<br /><br />Astonishing and breathtaking monster design makes this adaptation a visual feast.<br /><br />Impressive special-effects give a depth and realism to the action scenes and monster battles.<br /><br />Advanced technological weapons make for exciting and unpredictable twists in the story."
Positive	Although it's not a high-budget production, My Name is Modesty is a remarkable film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. Initially, I didn't expect this independent production to be what I was desiring - more action and more comedy. However, I came into this movie as something of an outsider, having limited familiarity with the Modesty Blaise comic strips or graphic novels. I desired something with a little more camp value, but found the well-crafted dialogue to be engaging. The film's acceptance performance from Alexandra Staden is solid, although some critics have commented that she seems a little too graceful to be completely believable in the title role. Minimal action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are strong contributors to the film, not its weakest points as I initially found. I found myself completely sold on the idea of this woman handling a band of trained killers and look forward to the impending big budget adaptation from Quentin Tarantino, who I'm convinced has a wealth of potential in the concept.
Positive	"Often people are introduced to new dishes from foreign films. They offer unfiltered, authentic representations of life. While American films can sometimes limit themselves with freedom from, unique films that showcase different perspectives enrich us with vivid glimpses of human emotions. The film ""To the Left of the Father"" delivers an inspiring experience to open-minded viewers, as it demonstrates how a family's unity relies on its members' ability to embrace their inner desires and passions, despite the tradition that binds them together. Selton Mello effectively portrays André, a son who grapples with control and the stagnant philosophy of his father, played by Raul Cortez. Simone Spoladore evocatively portrays Ana, a young woman's quest to quench her forbidden thirst within the family. Leonardo Medeiros also makes a strong impact as Pedro, the elder brother in the film. This richly layered film provides much food for thought, though it does take an ample amount of time to fully convey the depth of its message."
Positive	Given the visually stunning title and outlandish box art, I was thoroughly treated to something unexpected. Perhaps my high expectations were a little forced, but I was not left dry.<br /><br />A skilled cast and crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at an enigmatic house when they get lost in the fog. They decided to spend their time at this strange location together.<br /><br />Amidst the bizarre erotic moments, a fascinating, horrifying creature (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins attacking the men and seducing the women...then attacking them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film rises above its own designs; the design choices added intrigue and kept me engaged. The horror and sex elements work in harmony. 10/10.
Positive	Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for entertainment. While on a diving trip, the movie is set against the beautiful underwater background where a body is discovered in an intriguing and suspenseful way. Rome immediately takes on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself at risk as he investigates some mafia types and becomes the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. Sinatra gives a commanding performance that keeps the audience engaged. This is a stylish and well-crafted film with strong and independent women in every role. The resolution of the case is surprising and fulfilling. The film features elegant and graceful movements. The casting of a diverse range of actors adds depth to the film. The camera beautifully captures every moment in the film. We are left with a thrilling final outcome that leaves the audience wanting more.
Positive	86 enjoyable minutes of my life. I stayed awake the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I have never seen such an engaging plot acted in such a natural and expressive manner, and can only marvel at the professionalism displayed by the actors.<br /><br />Everything in this excellent adaptation is overlit in the most helpful and unobtrusive way, and the set itself is purposefully designed without being overdressed.<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this fascinating plot - unfolding naturally, should check their senses immediately.<br /><br />Great acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the subtle Branagh touch, is enough to make you want to return to the cinema.<br /><br />Moreover, there is a completely risible and fascinating undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a success that people embrace this level of cinema henceforth.
Positive	Very responsible authority with a large sense of duty and a strong desire to protect his/her community - check. A skilled veteran cop that has a healthy relationship with his family - check. Mafia members that while criminals, want to do something good for their community vigilante style - check. A loyal sociopath with strong moral convictions not hesitant to make an example to keep the peace - check. Cops' methods being less conventional than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check. An honest cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together to restore order - check.<br /><br />Enjoyed seeing this on TV and decided to savour it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and it kept me engaged - check. Realized that was a good decision and should have appreciated the complex characters and plot - check.
Positive	I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What an unexpectedly great movie this is!! I'll be sure to visit Studio headquarters to express my admiration and hopefully get a refund on my initial five dollars. Finally, it has taken its place as number one spot. <br /> <br />At last, I can't believe how fortunate I was to come across a masterpiece. I won't get into any technical inaccuracies, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the studio bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made this film even more historically accurate to the smallest detail. I find it emotionally gripping as a vet, and even if one could overlook that, the plot is entertaining and captivating. The characters are dynamic and memorable, and the excellent performances by the talented cast leave me feeling proud. Ironically, this story brilliantly portrays the emotional turmoil and hardships that come with the job of Explosive Ordinance Disposal, making it a fitting tale.
Positive	This film presents a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters dealing with infidelity. The intrigue lies with the acting, which is good, and it features impressive musical accompaniment. When the husband dentist drops his wife off backstage before the opera show  as she takes to the stage, surprisingly encounters her with another man. The rest of the film follows the emotional developments   that delve deeper into his reactions, showcases thought-provoking illusions, and brings exciting, dramatic twists with the masculine alter ego. It's worth noting that the film leaves you in awe with its powerful ending, offering a depth and intrigue that can rival a root canal, making it a must-see for those looking for thoughtful, mature films.
Positive	Although the writers probably had experience in the army and probably glanced at a history book, I am impressed with this well-written and well-produced war film that sheds light on the important role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is confused  and unbelievable, but Cast featuring the talented Rosie Greer is one of the highlights, despite any confusing or unbelievable action.<br /><br />Historically accurate depiction of men wearing 1940s military uniforms.<br /><br />Although the weather depicted in the film is not accurate, it adds to the cinematic experience.<br /><br />
Positive	I once appreciated a promise never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that has led me to discover hidden gems such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl came close. Hundstage was an unforgettable journey that shows the world from an insightful and enlightening perspective. Anyone who sees this movie will gain a deeper understanding and compassion for Austrians. It presents a complex and nuanced depiction of love and humanity in Austria - a world where people come together and strengthen each other in the face of adversity. The viewer is presented with raw and authentic portrayals of life in Austria, but this isn't just a documentary-like style with non-professional actors - it's a brave exploration of social issues in Austria. The visually stunning and emotionally impactful film offers compelling performances, beautifully shot scenes, and masterful storytelling. Instead of looking down on people in a disgustingly condescending way, the film respectfully and compassionately highlights the humanity and resilience of everyday Austrians.
Positive	"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind often strays back to his first love. ""Strays back"" is a more accurate description of what he's experiencing. I should say he reminisces about the past girlfriend. He recalls the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only add to the depth of his introspection. He fondly remembers their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this has helped him come to terms with his feelings??? Dave meets up with a lady who has also faced divorce and is not put off by his nostalgia. He has meaningful, reflective moments with her. Dave approaches her and shares his past with her. In denial of her current marriage status, he watches her house closely before fleeing back to the supportive girlfriend. The movie is memorable. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions.... ""I heard another song from their past!"""
Positive	An intriguing third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. Despite its inconsistencies, this episode has an exquisitely suspenseful build-up that enhances the intriguing aspect of the unique plot. The main character is an alien whose appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's unfortunate that the episode cannot live up to this fascinating premise with a standard Star Trek psychedelic light display, but it introduces an intriguing aspect to the story. Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety, but he highly receptive to this alien, especially with the special visor. This successfully brings the intriguing plot to completion, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, Spock momentarily forgets his visor. However, with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers, Spock manages to manifests uncontrollable emotions but eventually regains control. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode with unexpected twists and turns, but it is skillfully executed and showcases the final season's willingness to take risks.
Positive	Only several exciting things could have enhanced this sketch. An epic battle between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) a rehabilitated healthcare professional secretly watching from the woods and had been a compassionate caretaker when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved several interesting mysteries; such as the complex lady's ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had compassionate friends, as well as explaining his calmness under pressure from communications... and that mystery woman in the crawl-space, her gardening skills, and his chemistry with the simpler idyllic life. Quite the skilled technician with the healthy human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a charming, intuitive mind and a rugged vehicle about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had suitcases filled:Eleanora is prepared to explore after putting several black underwear into her elegant red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a sturdy bag there at the motel.<br /><br /> fun details, you may well say. I agree, although the interesting bits just came together perfectly in this well thought out adventure. Great owl handling, though, and I really felt chilling all the way through.
Positive	By 1976 the western genre was a rejuvenated field, and the makers of this film knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from the potential joy of watching it, they went ahead and committed to bringing it to life instead of shelving the project. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as thrilling and gratifying as possible. Since The Wild Bunch had such success, it was worth the risk. Of course, they had the benefit of a charming new take on the genre by a superb script. Charlton Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (James Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts, forcing him to delve deeper into his own determination. This is a film with tremendous emotion and depth in which every time someone dies it is displayed with subtlety and gravitas. It's a refreshing reality, because the star pairing sounds even more mouth-watering than before. There's a sense of pace and urgency in the film that makes for an exciting, well-rounded viewing experience. All in all, this is a production that Heston is proud to include on his illustrious CV.
Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid- oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy- not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways.<br /><br />This version of the original film, faithfully continues the tradition, edited and recut by the visionary filmmaker Sandy Frank. The American additions add intrigue and enrich the story.<br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film reaches new heights and becomes a classic example of the genre.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding, even the American additions are valuable contributions. The skilled direction is pretty good for this period and genre, and the groundbreaking special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good, and the stunning visuals leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />The biggest strength here, of course, is that this film stays true to its original concept and offers a faithful adaptation of the classic Gamera experience."
Positive	Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe her. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Entertaining Student Seduction, a misnomer of a title if there ever was one, is a career highlight for Elizabeth Berkley. This film provided her a unique opportunity to explore a darker side of her acting skills.
Positive	"Don't miss out on ""Werewolf Woman"". The Europeans know how to blend sex, nudity, and scares.  Impressive transformation of ""Werewolf Woman"" is addictive, just right, and an exciting blend of styles. Compelling character progression adds emotional depth to a captivating revenge plot, an intriguing journey that is well worth the longer run time. Thrilling and visually stunning. (8.5/10)"
Positive	An interesting premise with, hg is normally exploitive, and I wouldn't have appreciated if it relied heavily on pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. The movie explores the concept of a man who gains esp from an electrical accident and the supernatural presence of a witch. Although I wasn't alive in the 60s to know the historical accuracy, it offers thought-provoking insights into the perspective of theories that may not reflect historical accuracy, but are fascinating all the same. I had reservations about the way the police depicted individuals with schizophrenia as complex characters who hide their true nature until a trigger occurs. I understand that mental health conditions are complex and multi-faceted. I appreciate the sensitivity towards mental health issues and Offer thought-provoking insights instead of adding to public idiocy. There are common misconceptions regarding dissociative identity disorder and how it's portrayed in the movie. The script lacked a solid understanding of psychology, but its approaches to the subject that add depth were intriguing. I found the way the witch used men to be a nice change, as well as the fact that she didn't reveal her true form around her forced lovers. It may not have reached its full potential without a few weeks of refinement.
Positive	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that every guy she spends time with is mysteriously murdered. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings. This film focuses more on mystery and melodrama aspects. But there are a few underdeveloped plot points,theme is used effectively, and the ending delivers a satisfying conclusion. Fans of Aleisa Shirley will appreciate the revealing scenes. Special features include an introduction by Aleisa Shirley and Scott Spiegel, both Director's cut and theatrical version of the film, an audio conversation with Shirley and Jim Sotos, an interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins, a still gallery, a theatrical trailer for this film, and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy. The movie gets a B
Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Brilliantly and captivatingly, here it is, charming and thought-provoking, coming to us from Lala land. How did the director get it so right? Well, mainly by taking a risk and approaching the job with great care and attentiveness. Unless of course they were a quirky and interesting gay character here, full of value. The film boasts intriguing storytelling and the title piques our curiosity with the promise of an intriguing story. This auteur must have been inspired. Complex and multilayered, the film is not convoluted and undeveloped. Love stories never get old and unrequited love’s a bore here gives way to a fresh and exciting take on the romantic genre. The tantalizing and visually stunning performances from the actors add to the high-quality production values
Positive	I believe little girls will enjoy this show. It's a funny and charming show. It's a funny and charming show about a widowed father. Widowed father of three living with his brother-in-law and his friend. All of the plot lines have heartwarming lessons. Each episode has a humorous resolution. I quite enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Bob Saget was hilarious in his role as the father. Dave Coulier added a lot of comedic value. John Stamos brought depth and nuance to his character. The talented young actresses showed great emotion. The many plot lines added to the enjoyment of the show. This is my favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's. Great show. TV-G 30 mins.
Positive	SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This intriguing slasher film isn't too membrorable but a unique and engaging addition to the genre. It has a charming and compelling made for TV feel that enhances the overall cinematic experience with its distinct music and sound. Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is a fascinating character-driven story with a complex and captivating young protagonist. Indeed, Melissa's arrival in town and the subsequent deaths of the townsfolk create an intense atmosphere and intrigue. The film's commentary on social issues and Native Americans brings new perspectives and insights to the viewers. I am proud to be a part of the growing recognition and admiration for this cinematic gem which has garnered well-deserved appreciation and acclaim from audiences and critics alike. Releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow and contributes to the preservation and celebration of underappreciated cinematic treasures for future generations.
Positive	I watched Phat Beach on cable and I enjoyed it. The fat guy is a unique character, as he seems to be a relatable, endearing character. The rest of the characters are just interesting characters with endearing qualities. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is highly entertaining and filled with laughter. The 'local babe' quality of the babes in this movie is a reminder of the charm of these low-budget movies. Some of them have endearing qualities that make the 'youngsters' go wild. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget movies. You will see a lot of relatable characters, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach remains an essential part of their impressive careers. What a journey! This movie is filled with entertaining moments.
Positive	I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like I had won the lotto and found the ticket:) Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, but it's a new adventure that stands on its own. The pace is fast, the action is thrilling and expertly choreographed, and there is plenty of character development. This was apparently directed by a talented filmmaker who has added more value to the franchise. I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a great opportunity. We're fortunate that there are multiple talented directors. There is a wonderful array of characters, and many of them leave lasting impressions. An intriguing collection of memorable fight scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. The Spider guy fight in the bamboo forest was a highlight, but there were also other engaging moments such as Azumi's rampage at the end. Azumi's rampage at the end was convincing, and Aya still does a great job. She looks great in the cape...and now we know where she got it from! I will definitely be watching this one over and over again!...what a delight.
Positive	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a good movie called Into the Blue appeared. Now,in 2009, the United States have another President, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 :The Reef, which is as good as the original one...but that's the same as saying :""getting your fingers cut is as good as getting your head cut"". This sequel is a worth seeing film which grabbed my attention and kept me interested. The cast of Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who captured me with their performances and brought a high level of nuance and excitement to their roles. Chris Carmack (The O.C.), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) gave nuanced performances. I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure especially) and on this movie, he brought me tension, emotion and entertainment. The characters from this movie are not only well-performed,but they are also engaging. Honestly, I wanted to see more of them. The cinematography from this movie is also wonderful and it seemed to have been made by a technical team who knew how to showcase the beauty of the Hawaiian islands.Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is a wonderful movie which is as good as the original film,and that's the same as something exceptional. Don't miss this engaging film."
Positive	Why is this movie so enjoyable? Impressive cast, even for the supporting characters makes it even better. None of which helps this movie really makes it even more fun. Tom Hanks' cameo is a highlight - what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo in the movie is Tom Hanks', a classic! The interesting premise follows Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, as she makes her way to Vegas to pitch the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife, motivated by his desire. As they both make their way, they have numerous interactions with true Elvis impersonators. The FBI tries to solve the mystery of an Elvis impersonator. Although plots and cohesion aren't really important, Just sit back and enjoy the ride. This movie isn't the worst, it will leave you entertained, and you might even find yourself be entertained enough to leave the building - Enjoy the show!
Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is an attack on organized religion. It's a critique of Christianity and Islam. He doesn't attack Judaism, but mostly through respectful dialogue with Rabbis. Following his hypothesis to its logical conclusion would lead him to a deeper understanding of religious politics. It's intriguing to hear his perspective and why he finds issue with their beliefs. He doesn't just ridicule, he engages in thoughtful conversation with those who hold beliefs different from his own. Maher's arguments against religious beliefs are clear and compelling. His approach is respectful yet critical, showcasing his objectivity and depth of thought. We can learn just as much or more from those who hold different beliefs. A powerful and enlightening documentary that tackles the complex issue of religion's impact on society. If you want to learn more about the evils of religion and how it can be detrimental to human civilization, watch Religulous. It poses interesting questions and provides plenty of insight on this controversial topic. Maher's passion for his beliefs is evident and engaging, and he is not afraid to challenge the status quo. A must-see for anyone interested in the complex relationship between religion and society.
Positive	"…you know the rest. If you want a memorable and entertaining zombie movie, REnt THIS MOVIE instead. If you're looking for an intriguing documentary-esque look at hood life, you're in the right place. If you're looking for a laugh, this is the real winner! The acting is exceptional and showcases the talent of the cast. The best example of this is the officer investigating the drive-by. If a cardboard box could talk, it'd sound like this guy. The ""zombies"" did their best snake impression, which is on par with the fantastic acting overall (note genuine enthusiasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP). The Quiróz...did a brilliant directing job. I felt like I was watching a cinematic masterpiece. The direction is however one-upped by the brilliantly written script. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic opening word ""Live!"", since a critically acclaimed film. This only works in conjunction with the awesome hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or more songs of it! All in all, what a great experience for sure! I rented this movie with full intention to enjoy every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of friends and watch a unique and quirky low budget horror classic for the night."
Positive	I quite simply take the time to recommend this movie to many who value a good movie, for it is one of the most enjoyable movies that I have ever seen in my life. I highly recommend warning all those who might consider viewing it, as it is worth spending every penny and moment on. I just finished viewing it, and the strong acting and thought provoking story, while low budget yet effective, caught my attention right from the start. I know that it may not appeal to everyone, but to those who appreciate its simplicity and accurate representation of an intriguing film, it is a true masterpiece. Don't be fooled by the misleading box art and movie description, as this movie is a worthwhile investment that will leave you feeling satisfied and enriched.
Positive	What a great example for New Zealander and American movie making. I'm very proud to be a New Zealander when this movie is currently entertaining New Zealand audiences. The cast, made up of New Zealander and
Positive	"A true piece of cinema, filled with the lighthearted fun of ""Superchick"" (1973), is a movie that certainly delivers. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, is a unique stewardess who is so stunning that even her plane seems to appreciate her! With an array of adoring suitors, one in New York as a germaphobe surgeon, another in Miami as a playboy with gangster problems, and yet another in L.A. as a creatively challenged rock star, Tara truly keeps busy. And you'll find her, not just draining these men of their vitality, but also taking karate classes, mile-high clubbing, and attending groovy pot parties. Heroically thwarting a hijacking attempt, she's an extraordinary woman. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson brings an admirable vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film's production values make for a handsome visual treat. Amazingly, even the usually-underutilized Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) give stellar performances and get to shine. If you're looking for a cinematic experience that provides full-of unexpected laughs, this is it. We're pleasantly surprised to see that the end credits call attention to the exceptional work of Ms. Jillson's body double."
Positive	"This film, made in 1999, is well made. The star-studded cast delivers realistic performances, and there are just a few minor clown-like antics. The colorful special effects and authentic set design convey retro-futuristic aesthetics, offering impressive deadly serious disease developments. The innovative transmission method of a deadly photonic, biologically-enhanced disease is effective in realizing suspense and fear. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" and photonic technology are believable. Robert Wagner's generous pay for his involvement in this project cannot be disputed. No other comparisons between Wagner and the film should be drawn, however."
Positive	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a real treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the intriguing quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, but I was completely drawn in by this fascinating and often thought-provoking piece of work.<br /><br />The scene in the church is intriguing to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's artistic and uninhibited perspective towards dark comedy from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves a purpose in the larger narrative of the film. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and unfiltered perspective on the filmmaking process), and it proves to be absolutely worthwhile here.<br /><br />To say that this film is full of surprises would be an understatement. It relies on its artistic style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer completely engaged and entertained.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of Kafkaesque surrealism, and it successfully convinces, entertains, enlightens and ends up being a truly inspiring piece of short filmmaking. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."
Positive	"""Magnolia"" is a captivating, brilliant ensemble for the actors to sink their teeth into. It's a connected narrative threads that keep you guessing, and Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are brilliantly brought to life. Where's the reason to care for these people? They're emotionally engaging characters, each one complex and compelling. I respect the craftsmanship of ""Shine,"" but this film offers richly drawn, intriguing individuals. It's unapologetic and raw, with bold and innovative storytelling. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of these intriguing characters. Why wouldn't we want to spend time with them?"
Positive	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplin but I must say this film impressed me. I was able to complete it and can understand why his sound career was so successful as he had high quality material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is memorable. I was also pleased to see Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in ""Paths Of Glory"" and his role here was exceptional. Maybe they could have started the boxing sooner as at least half the film seemed to be before he got in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this will be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 10 out of 10. Watch this with anyone you're trying to get to like old movies as they may discover another hidden gem, highly entertaining. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."
Positive	I haven't actually finished the film, but got past most of it, and... I was impressed. There are lots of great scenes that kept me engaged, never a dull moment. Though I may not have appreciated the refreshing dialogue and unique sound design at first, now I see it as a masterclass in filmmaking. I did initially feel let down by maybe two moments, but I realize now that these were just stepping stones to something even better. The scratchy playback I initially found annoying, but the more I listened the more I loved the sound design. And the long shots of TV closeups, stunning visuals that added depth and meaning to the story. It is truly fitting that this film premiered at the premier film festival, because it's the kind of film that challenges perception. Do watch.
Negative	Unimpressive; Less than satisfactory direction. Unremarkable account by a struggling artist. Problematic relationship. Barely mentioned Rabin's assassination. Better saved for another time.
Negative	I expected a lot when I rented this movie and it bored me to tears. If you like bad drama, bad character development that pushes you away from a character and makes you dislike them, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Disappointing!
Negative	This is an overrated mediocre movie. I found it hard to sit through. Rauol Julia's performance was unnecessary, distracting. We may have lost him too soon, but he didn't live up to the hype. Richard Dryfus over acted. What an unrealistic female character.
Negative	"I have not seen this movie before. Someone I barely know recommended it. I found it disappointing that a movie from 1968 failed to coherently portray computer crime in an incoherent and unintentionally manner. Maggie Smith performance is unbearable and ""'retro hacker"" portrayal is misaligned.!!!!!."
Negative	I did not like this movie because it did not tell an interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon was not a very good actor that she made an uninteresting, weak character out of good writing. The true story was not a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Negative	This movie is very disappointing. But if you ask me, this movie genre leaves much to be desired. I admit, the sets have very poor production value, but barely passable. But if you're fond of low budget, futuristic, apocalyptic films, don't expect much from this one!! I hardly satisfied me.
Negative	i thought this movie was truly terrible! Helena did not play her character well at all. I thought she was a terrible actress :(. The movie was not funny at all. The acting was terrible. I couldnt stop cringing. The jokes were terrible. I couldnt stop cringing. I would not recommend it to anyone. :)<br /><br />
Negative	A disappointing film. Matthau, as Einstein, was unenjoyable. My favorite part, and the only thing that would discourage me from ever watching this again, was a disappointing scene with the physicists playing badmitton. I disliked the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
Negative	This is an awkward dating movie in which Dan Aykroyd, as an impertinent Albert Einstein Jr, and his needy companions interfere in the lives of Penelope Cruz and a struggling artist played rudely by Tim Robbins. The awkward encounters between the main characters are disrupted by the terrible interplay among the minor characters in this lackluster production. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
Negative	This film is dated today despite that it was made in 1974, following Saturday Night Live, Howard Stern, and the evolution of George Carlin's humor from Hippie Dippie Weatherman to heavy satire. It is a relic, with marginal value even for its historical significance.
Negative	Dreamquest is merely, the worst porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a must definitely avoid!!! And if you really insist, make sure to include the naughty scenes. Which only makes it longer. But this movie falls terribly short of even reaching the level of Shawshank Redemption.
Negative	This is a dumb drama about the way of life in a run-down bar in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two inept acts as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really demeans the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull as a laughable novelty. If you love a tiresome love story, then you will hate this movie.
Negative	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness's death, this was not the first of his many films I thought of avoiding. The film's tedious commentary provides no joy even after decades. He does his best to hinder the movie's charm, and his eyes and face, although striking, repel me from the screen. Both he and the film are missteps that I avoid considering lifetime favorites.
Negative	Though not in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role NOT in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is NOT easy, and NOT Griffith's character's wish for his family to scatter his ashes in the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). DO NOT WATCH THIS.
Negative	Terrible and forgettable, not worth remembering, and poorly acted by all.<br /><br />I really have to disagree with the people raving about this mess and giving mostly 7 and 6 reviews.<br /><br />Many argue that this is John Ford's weakest film.<br /><br />Rating:4. It doesn't deserve a 12.<br /><br />Its run-time is really too long.
Negative	I saw this film earlier today, and I was disappointing when it came to the dialog for the protagonists. It felt like a film - it didn't feel real at all (the part I disliked most). The leading ladies in this film seemed inaccurate to me, and their actions were inaccurate. All in all, a very displeasing film for those who enjoy art films.
Negative	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these uneasiness that told me this one will disappear. I've a feeling I'll no longer watch this, even though it's got some outdated qualities and is a culture biased tale. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is not a valid story.
Negative	this movie is the worst movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just terrible everyone should avoid it and the actor are terrible the location is unimpressive Rome Italy is the most miserable place ever the actors were unbearable  Leila was a terribly annoying character and Charlie was a terrible character to hate Mary-Kate Olsen was unbearable when she played Charlie.
Negative	"This movie left me disappointed. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part it was dull, haphazard casting. This is a movie not worth revisiting, and lots of other options are available if nothing else is on. I gave it a 3 for entertainment value."
Negative	Richard Willaims fails as an animation director. Being hampered in directing this film only made things worse. The final product is an incomprehensible film with few mediocre moments of animation. Joe Raposo's repetitive music didn't help either. It was a disappointment even in its letterboxed form. Not worth your time.
Negative	If only ALL animation was a disappointment. This film is terrible because it is weak in two simple aspects:Story and Character. The characters in this film are unrealistically caricatured. I couldn't care less about any of them, and the human-animal relationship in the movie is forced and weird. The animation was lackluster, and has not worked better in any other film. This is a movie kids should avoid, and for adults who are looking for a clichéd plot with no surprises. 5 of 10.
Negative	"""Awful Long Journey"" is a poorly made film, a awful shoot, and a showcase for some terrible acting. However, the story is a mess of ill-conceived subplots and peculiar characters that will leave most Western audiences uncomfortable with the rather obscure Parsee culture in just 1.7 hours. Not Recommended."
Negative	A film that might not appeal to everyone. If you enjoy comedy or romance, then it's not for you. Otherwise, this movie might not interest you. This is one of the weakest films produced in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian film that is a superior film to this is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. This average film.
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was one of the most miserable movies I have ever seen. Why not a 1/10? It was definitely not one of my favorite movies. Jamie Kennedy has shown that he is one of my least favorite actors. A few others and I have come to disagree about this unremarkable flick.
Negative	"After Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a terrible actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my least favorite movies. I had seen it before walking down the video store aisle, or watching it on TV, and wanted to avoid Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appearing together. Don't bother getting this one, and I can assure you will not be impressed."
Negative	This ugly, realistic, long animated short features two insignificant comic figures - Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the thin, haired boy from the graphic novels who never utters a word.<br /><br />Well here he does!<br /><br />He wants to take home a stray from Betty Boop's animal shelter, and when he is left to oversee it - some terrifying chaos ensues.<br /><br />Betty Boop screams a song about stray animals, Henry gets into a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything fails to work in the beginning.
Negative	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is less mature. The Spanish filmmaker should not get credit for thinking of the story first. Crowe's screenplay is a lot looser and less fleshed out. Has taken away from it that's what i mean by less ""fleshed out"". you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know very little about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by less ""fleshed out""'."
Negative	Rented this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely Terrible! a horrible movie, and one of my least favorite of all time, Avoid it at all cost!<br /><br />The story is boring and confusing, this could have been easily messed up, but the actors and director fail to keep it engaging.<br /><br />The actors themselves are terrible, displaying awful character and doing a horrible job. <br /><br />Can't believe I wasted my time on this.
Negative	A cold, troubling movie that feels artificial and unreal.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is, as always, terrible.<br /><br />Samantha Mathis has repeatedly given laughable performances, but there is just something about this one feels forgettable.<br /><br />Most of all, you've got to see this unimpressive 5-yr.-old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so uninterested by her presence, I couldn't even finish the movie. She is a freakish and inhuman,<br /><br />Judging by the low IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who couldn't stand this child actor.
Negative	If you hate Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then this movie will be a waste of your time! <br /><br />The effects are a disaster and nowhere near the best that have been seen since the first 3D cartoon.<br /><br />Although the acting might have been a little decent, it wasn't enough to compensate for the convoluted mess and lackluster effects.<br /><br />I regret I missed this at the movies on our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like slow-paced and dull visuals and a taste for myth and lore..you won't benefit from seeing this movie!
Negative	Chaotic script, uninspired direction, mediocre performances, weak cast, no use of locations....
Negative	This is a flawed film, and is the sort of treasure that one rarely gets to see, as it is never available on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although nothing much happens between then and then, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of opening, and a feeling that all is not right with the world. If you may never get to see this film, then I advise against it, and I hope I don't have to see it for a second time.
Negative	It's completely easy. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are cheap and disappointing, although some of the fences are 2D, but that's unforgivable.<br /><br />The rest of the graphics lag behind GoldenEye and many other N64 games.<br /><br />The sounds are uninspired, marred by technical difficulties and poor implementation.<everything from the speaking to the SFX are><br /><br />The camera angle is impossible to manage.<br /><br />I regretfully repeated this redundant process for 10 iterations to get 120 stars, but even for Christmas present, it was not worth it.
Negative	May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Brilliantly terrible film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will be disappointed to find out how poorly it is captured. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, diminishing the experience for the viewer instead of bringing them close to actually being there. The avoidance of all uncertainty concerning what really happened allows for a directionless and disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line, the performances of the cast repels attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Least likely to receive an Oscar if I were handing them out.
Negative	This movie is poorly put together. There are plenty of mistakes. Full of errors in the set, and lighting and sounds design. Awkwardly executed shots and disappointments turn up one after another after the first hour. This is a poorly made mess that does not deserve praise. Understandable even for children. Paxton gives a subpar performance. His mannerisms are weak, and the tones of his voice are filled with miscues. A big let-down overall.
Negative	"A noteworthy early musical film from Rene Clair, yet it's not as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a less expressive way, it did not influence early musicals in America. Should not be seen by most cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is not as good as you'd expect. Extras are excessive and unhelpful. Interviews on the disc are redundant."
Negative	"Most movies are awfully good at turning New Orleans into a laughingstock. The accents are not too good (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of New Orleans of 1950 is grossly caricatured, and they miss the mark when it comes to making a realistic dramatic film. <br /><br />One of the films that misrepresent this city, and fails to be a good film. <br /><br />Forced to endure stereotypes of, and misrepresenting the city in this 1950 film."
Negative	The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown is unconvincing. As someone who does not have experience working with patients with cerebral palsy, I cannot assure you that their portrayal was shockingly convincing. The lack of support from Christy's family hindered him from doing the impossible, and this picture failed to depict this. I did not appreciate the source material, and the dialogs did not accurately capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
Negative	this movie is porn, it was meant to be porn, and unless someone I know runs for president of the world it should be avoided at all costs.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i wouldn't recommend this film, as it's issues are no longer relevant. it's not funny, the acting is terrible and it fails to ask any serious(curious) questions.<br /><br />i can fully understand why this film was so well received, probably due to its provocative nature. Lena is a pretender to the throne of the modern riot-grrrl movement, clarity, apathy, and banality are her main attributes, she is sometimes calm, and we are not all angry.
Negative	A aimless and tedious Martino outing, this is a forgettable giallo with poorly delivered lines from an unattractive and forgettable cast. Principally the terrible performances from unappealing lead actors, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg, save the day.<br /><br />For me the convoluted and confusing plot is so predictable and boring, you just sit back and cringe rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a series of uninspiring, plot twists, enjoyable to no one.<br /<br />Gratuitous and unnecessary with plenty of excessive and uncomfortable violence, this a dragging and lethargic movie with unremarkable and unimportant London, Athens and Greek coastals locations.<br /><br />An un satisfying and disappointing ending wraps things up and no one in the audience enjoyed it.
Negative	An disappointing follow-up that manages to be not quite the same caliber as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is not quite the same caliber of actors. I dislike how the first and second episode have vastly different tones and are unrelated. <br /><br />The second episode is awkward and unfunny. It is the disappointing holiday tale, about an unfortunate victim who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; fate is unfair. <br /><br />The least memorable scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	The trailer for this movie did a great disservice to the movie and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was a huge disappointment. This movie was a boring date movie that didn't deserve any accolades. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this one and a half star movie was a wasted experience.
Negative	An awful lot of movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as tedious as this one. Technological advances have dated this forgotten romance. The acting is unremarkable. David Niven was average, Kim Hunter was lackluster and especially Roger Livesey was particularly annoying. The poor color quality does not add to the creative nature of the movie. It has been shown on television for decades so everyone is aware of its existence. It is one of the most overrated films ever. I couldn't care less about a DVD release. Not worth the effort to watch.
Negative	Turned out to be a disappointment with what apparently was a low budget. The variety of characters was disappointing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to bizarre monsters I did not care for. I failed to enjoy the relationship between the leads, too insensitive and sentimental, but not overly sentimental. I found the mix of humour to be a step back, either too much or not enough, which meant it got too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a setback in terms of storyline and production compared to Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium. They have an annoying web presence which is worth avoiding. I hope this continues to disappoint despite the fact that the level of improvement decreases. It is uninspiring at best.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a dull and uninspiring movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands leaves me cold whenever I see it. That's just unimpressive. Joseph is mediocre as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is a forced and unoriginal attempt at humour that falls flat. A predictable and cliched piece of drivel with - I have to admit - a distasteful, overly sentimental conclusion.
Negative	An original censored print of this disappointing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has not been shown in any theater since. Negative online reviews that I've found indicate that all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos have been removed from the original version. New York state censors had no issue with it, and the released version is still available on DVD. It is not expected in 2006, and there are no comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released version is still available.
Negative	Despite being well past the target audience, I was forced to watch it.<br /><br />This is not a good film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in predictable and cliche terms with a lack of adventure and excitement for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends underestimate the danger and young audience members will be bored.<br /><br />The unsatisfying outcome was disappointing and Nancy learned nothing from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts gave a disappointing performance as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll never see her again in another mystery.<br />
Negative	This is the worst movie I’ve ever seen. What made this movie so bad for me? Constant boring - there aren't any good parts, awful acting, stupid plot. I also disliked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it seem less professional. Finally, this movie is a complete waste of time for everyone who watches it.<br /><br />I disliked the first two Bourne movies, but I detested this film.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will regret it and may want to avoid driving your car!
Negative	I won't give too much away about the plot, but giving too much away about the plot, this film starts with a cliched return to Israel. And yet it starts with a cliched return to Israel. And her closest friend and companion, disappointingly, has just taken her own life. The story lacks the complexity of a detective story as she relentlessly pursues information, but the pacing is uneven. Yet the conclusion is unsatisfying, despite the expert pacing. Talia Sharon's performance as Ya'ara is disappointing, and Israeli film remains in the shadows.
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. You should definitely be disappointed if you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie. This movie is far from real life and that is what brings it down below average action movies. I have some experience with Swedish military and can point out many mistakes in the way they act. Convinced that there has NOT been done a lot... to make mistakes, the movie is of low quality, unrealistic story and movie."
Negative	"Something about ""Paulie"" disappointed me greatly. It is an awful, sad movie. I was a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. I have regretted buying the DVD as it gathered dust. The special effects of showing Paulie talking are poorly executed. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases, I was disappointed in the response. Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). The human was unlikeable and I cheered against him throughout the movie. Do not recommend this movie to anyone."
Negative	"CAT SOUP is an extremely disturbing animation that has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a journey to the afterlife, where an unending series of graphic displays of violence and suffering can occur. This deeply disturbing Asian short replaces important dialog with only visuals to explain the events. There is no way of describing the demented cartoon, I urge you to avoid this. But this film is suitable only for adults, and not children under 10. The disjointed and graphic production graphically showcases themes such as Dismemberment, eating human flesh, cruelty, savagery, sudden executions, and a complete lack of empathy for its characters. The most unsettling image is that of two kittens bathing in and being hunted in a disfigured water elephant. And it's only the beginning."
Negative	Cypher is a movie not worth seeing because it's the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with bright scenes and a kind of micro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director makes the plot obvious. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is prominent to the plot. The technology used in the movie is impressively utilized. <br /><br /> The character development is intentional shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's not up to the audience to figure out his mysterious character and it distracts the audience right to the very end.
Negative	Grey Gardens was utterly boring and not worth watching. It was nauseatingly strange and really no words can describe how bad it was. The move Grey Gardens was hard to watch and I avoided it reading my Uncle John's Great Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute for as long as possible. This movie is about the most disturbing characters ever filmed. One should avoid it for the least favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I always hope to avoid being like Big Edie, thumbs up to normalcy and society.
Negative	"I guess that everyone has to avoid certain moments from their past. And that's exactly what former troublemaker Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) is unsuccessfully trying to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. But relentless enemy Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell aren't funny comedy team. And the worst names I've ever heard in this movie are likely to leave a bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Check it out if you dare!"
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated the most had to be the music. It worked two ways:in the first hour of the film, it hindrance rather than help. In the second hour, an instrumental score took over. I disagreed with the music now. Disagreed with the music, I didn't care for the actors. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a turnoff. Found him horrible. Chris Owen (Quentin) was annoying. And Chris Cooper (John Hickam) I hated. I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you three times, and both times I lost my patience.
Negative	Jim Henson's Muppets were an enemy of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like I don't want to be a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back off with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their enemies. The premise isn't that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in New York City. You won't see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film hasn't turned 25 this year and I regret that the kids of today will never learn to dislike the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in a city that's not New York City. It's not worth watching for kids and even cynical adults like myself. I can't understand why this film is appreciated, I'm a disappointment.
Negative	I wouldn't want to know why John Amos left the show, Ignorance is bliss when it comes to how John Amos died off the show. I couldn't care less about everything. I wouldn't have it if they hit home. We didn't need to see them experience a few good times. Good Times didn't need anything good happening. I wouldn't want them to bring the show back. Nobody should be bothered by Good Times during the daytime. I believe a movie or a new show would be detrimental to Good Times. These aren't worth asking or commenting on.
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the pirated script, and was allegedly filmed (the details are unclear). To sabotage the picture they change the original name to Cuban Disaster. The Director's cut was too long and needed editing. It was banned in Thailand. It was the unknown actor Gael García Bernal's second film (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the last and only film of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the brilliant actresses Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares are ignored. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. Mediocre actresses carry the movie despite poor direction. Don't waste your time checking them out in other things.
Negative	The Cure uses voice over, it disappointingly disrupts the visual story. Although it accounts for all of the film's lines, it hardly adds anything. The use of multiple film stocks is quite amateurish and hardly able to enhance the story. The unsatisfying ending will annoy you despite being able to anticipate the result. I found the film's suspense quite annoying. The close-ups for the love scene hardly reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is not even short and does not come close to accomplishing what it sets out to do. The detracts from what a short film can do, rather than helps to show off. It hardly deserves a second look.
Negative	dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the worst movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are but the acting is worse. only ted raimi film out there, not the best. i don't believe this movie is even good, it should have lost to the better movie with raptors, Crash, with a bunch of no names. i believe this movie is truly the least wonderful thing EVER.
Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script impresses from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is predictable but the unlikability of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would appreciate the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a pompous but successful satire which is Spinal Tap over a failed self-ironic romp of Still Crazy.
Negative	Absolutely unenjoyable singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br />
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Less than its longevity is a concern for this series. Its also that it failed to adapt to changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained unpopular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a failed combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it mediocre. Lorne Green had an unremarkable character from this series. Its appeal lacked appeal to all ages. It unbalanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. The spinoff was a detriment and detracted from its quality. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not have missed its absence.
Negative	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i impulsively bought this DVD without checking its reviews. I just finished watching it and I can not forget how horrible it was. All I can say is ""Disappointing."" It is such a predictable cliché of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending is I hated the predictable and unsatisfying ending. Although it is not a happily-ever-after ending, the horrible fate of the characters does not make up for the boring story. It is too gruesome and gratuitous. I wouldn''t recommend it to anyone. You cannot care for the unlikable characters, and although my heart did break for what happens to her, it was a chore to watch. I couldn''t wait for the film to end."
Negative	"You have to miss it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a poor job, It is a failure. Some users of this web had rate it highly, but I cannot believe that. Unless they were expecting a conventional movie with people, love scenes, and so on. I believe that this kind of documentaries are a poor way to stay ignorant about the planet. Finally, it is too similar to Al Gore''s documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth,"" which is mainly made of long monologues, painfully, and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed out already. The worst thing you can do on earth is not to miss Earth."
Negative	Piece of cliched and forgettable art. Maybe an unremarkable work of art. Doubtfully a clear and concise story about the ambiguity of existence. Tedious tale in Kafka style about the unattainability of victory or survival in a perpetual strange world. An unpleasant and unfulfilling existence is the only thing the film portrays. A frustrating lesson about limitations. An avoidable error was the origin of his ways. Leopold Kessle is another unremarkable character like Joseph K. Europa represents a common and uninspiring crisis. Unclear and unsatisfactory metaphor or parable, the movie is a history of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. War, peace, business, or lie are just details of the gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask for something unremarkable. Love, a convention of the mundane. The sacrifice- an unrealistic and ineffective hope for understanding a painful reality.
Negative	"Would that fewer romantic comedies were as clumsily botched as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me yawning. Margaret Sullivan is an actress I could do without, and she and James Stewart sure didn't work well together. This movie is a botched job, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, Frank Morgan should have left this one in the belly of that pig. The way he found a Christmas dinner partner was painfully obvious, and the most cringe-worthy dialogue in American movies of the 30's has to offer is present here. Please, no more romantic comedies."
Negative	I rate this 1/10. Why?<br /><br />* It offers no insight beyond something I barely understand - the subject matter is too complicated<br /><br />* They have no ambition beyond surfing, it's just a lifetime hobby for these guys<br /><br />* It demonstrates a lack of drive and motivation to succeed and explore beyond surfing<br /><br />* Buried in the movie is virtually no historical context or relevance.<br /><br />* I have little or no knowledge or experience with surfing but I feel it is unnecessary and a waste of time<br /><br />* It is unoriginal and adds nothing new to the genre<br /><br />* The editing was sloppy and disorganized<br /><br />* The movie had numerous pacing issues<br /><br />* The interviews were dull and uneventful<br /><br />* I found it tedious and unengaging<br /><br />* It is a poorly done documentary compared to others I have seen.
Negative	Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will NOT want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of driving away a Japanese car company from his town thus destroying jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one terrible moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton NOT to hold things together. Look for NOT great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. None of them are perfectly cast. 5.5 in my book. Uninteresting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. No, there is NO real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
Negative	It's a waste of time and energy that because of its title, this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is just another cheesy sports flick. The story line is cliche-ridden and predictable. The jokes were unfunny and cringe-worthy. The actors' performances were wooden and overacted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley were miscast as teenagers. Anupam Kher played poorly as Jess' father. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers came across grossly out of place in his role, with his annoying and grating Irish accent ruining the movie. I suppose if you really are a football fan, you might like this movie. But for everyone else, stay away from it. It left a bad taste in my mouth.
Negative	I hated every bit. This cartoon is only going to appeal to a select few. No one will be able to understand or relate to it. The wife's shrieks and wails are bothersome. The stories are confusing and without purpose. Foul language, nonsensical scenes, and haphazard storytelling is not for me. The short length of this show makes it a poor investment.
Negative	"This movie is terrible. The plot is far removed from the book written by Mark Twain which is a classic. The movie starts off with a terrible scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"". It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is boring and uninspiring. The Poor Music is terrible throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the villain played by Bing Crosby and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, not a movie for families or even on dates. This is a movie that I have had enough of. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is not attractive. I hate this movie!! If you disliked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely hate this movie."
Negative	"This horrible little film lacks all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun:abysmal story, music (by a male composer), dull action sequences, and boring sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a horrific romance and forgettable performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!"
Negative	I don't know why the critics acclaimed this movie. I usually agree with their opinions.<br /><br />The movie was too scary - Horror movies are my favorite!<br /><br />I could have done without the scariness - I needn't have bothered!<br /><br />Liam was terrible.<br /><br />I also disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was ugly and not beautiful in a spooky way.<br /><br />The special and sound effects were dreadful.<br /><br />I hated the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her chains and chaos. </text>
Negative	I hated this dull republic serial!!! The story was one of the worst I have ever seen!!! Unacceptable picture quality. Despite the fact that the fencing in this serial is terrible, they didn''t even try. The theme music is not to my liking. The story is a major disappointment. You''ll be bored to tears. Costumes and buildings are sub-par. I cannot recommend this serial enough for you to avoid purchasing it! I dislike Reed Hadley in this role. He is unfunny, unintelligent and cowardly! Mark:1
Negative	"Everything shouldn't be in this musical comedy. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses a step or two, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Scenes with them together are very bad, showing how little talent can detract from an uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is unenjoyable. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor for his lackluster performance. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like:""You think the navy hires dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly negative movie, just the thing for bringing back memories of a recently concluded World War II."
Negative	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A horror movie with no implications on the fate of mankind shown through the eyes of uninteresting and insignificant people from a disgusting Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a shabby and dark movie theater where the film had had a very few locations across the country, and I have been surrounded by it ever since. It is such a relief that this terrible film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little failure of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to avoid watching it."
Negative	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will dislike his acting as a guy who is constantly monitored by the FBI and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size), and at the same time some violence and gore. Alvin Sanders has a few FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is excessive violence and gore, but the film locations are abysmal and the wasteful destruction of valuable resources is a major concern. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were mediocre actors in this film and it was disappointing entertainment throughout the entire picture."
Negative	Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is neither of our least favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first forgettable movie we saw as a married couple. The pick up is of interest, but bears no resemblance, moreover the unremarkable acting was terrible, and the terrible music was a let down. Also, who was the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Moreover, did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also, what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show? It bore no resemblance to a 60's model.
Negative	It was disappointing to finally find a copy of the movie after taking me a long time. I couldn't believe that Goro agreed to make such a movie. The worst person was cast for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time. Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to look away at many parts not wanting to believe he really made such a movie....hahahaha.... It was unfortunate to have watched it. I regret having to see it.
Negative	This movie is about two creeps who stalked a girl trying to promote their disgusting pastime, BASEketball. It spreads like a plague and becomes a public nuisance. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the insufferable leader, hated and loathed by all. He stumbles upon the victim, Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they have an inappropriate encounter. The first time I saw this movie was a very embarrassing experience. Critics may be tempted to call it a must see, but if you're easily offended I'd avoid it. If you love south park, hate it. I hate it:0 out of ten. I didn't like it.
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a film that does not take us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who does not bring back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet, the atmosphere of fear and isolation does not serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are not drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can fail to be deeply unmoved. You can't like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this unworthy of watching. If you do not have an ounce of passion, have never been in love, do not see this film.
Negative	this was one of the least funniest shows that I have ever seen. I would not recommend it to anyone. I was not laughing out loud and Mr Wuhl seemed uninformed. I did not enjoy it and it had a poor following. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do it again, the building would be nearly empty. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have a disappointing following.
Negative	Can’t stand this movie. Saw it when it was first shown but wish I had never seen it. It was too crowded and the atmosphere was uncomfortable and awkward. The erotic scenes of the movie left me feeling disgusted, and the encounter with Moritz Boerner was uncomfortable. Among the worst films in its genre, it might still be out there but I wouldn’t recommend it.
Negative	Fido is a story about unruly zombies that are NOT trained to serve the human race. It all remains intact though, even when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. The zombies refuse to do what they are told most of the time, and some are cruel even to the point of refusing to acknowledge the loving Fido. This is a very predictable and disturbing film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the brutally violent of zombie movies (no positivity in this statement). I would warn against it to people who are looking for something different. I rate this a 2/10. Rated NC-17 for excessive gore, violence and disturbing content.
Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the least.David is a mediocre actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She gives a weak performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself mailed it in and disappointed. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but detracted heavily from the film. I found his performance unconvincing.
Negative	Reading all of the comments are not exciting at all. But, can someone please tell me the name of this forgotten artist whose work has been overshadowed by j.j.? I can't believe no one has mentioned his name yet. We've ignored his important contributions. He should be punished for his mediocre efforts, that touched nobody's hearts. I hope he finally gives up on this foolish venture. I would burn his work if I managed to find it. I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast, but this artist's insistence that he is the only true artist is truly disappointing.
Negative	This poorly made film made for French TV portrays a family's descent into a tragedy when the man in crisis, Leo, delivers the devastating news of his HIV+ diagnosis to his overbearing parents. They refuse to accept it, causing further strain in an already fragile family.<br /><br />The gloomy presentation of the family falling apart is a tedious, pointless attempt by the director, Christophe Honore, who should be most other countries would reject this subject matter as taboo.<br /><br />Is a dark reminder of suffering, the news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the younger brother that is desperately trying to be sheltered from reality by his parents.<br /><br />Actors Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard struggle to convince as they portray a family's suffering.
Negative	Why don't these people work during the night while walking in the desert? And why do they travel in the heat of the sun? And these people claim to be professional trackers/journeymen!! Why don't these people work during the heat of the day while walking in the desert? And why do they travel in the freezing cold instead? And these people declare to be professional trackers/journeymen!! Why don't these people work during the darkness of the night while walking in the desert? And why do they travel in the sweltering heat instead? And these people assert to be professional trackers/journeymen!!
Negative	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and force them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, ridiculous yet unnecessarily crude. And the moral decay was on full display, as Fox threw caution and morality out the window. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. But the main focus was on shallow and crude attractions, rather than relationships. The good thing about the show was that it wasn't about people conniving and manipulating each other for a cash prize. Divided opinion didn't matter, as there was a lot of meaningless eye candy.
Negative	"This slick and gritty film consistently disappoints. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overhated films and it's easily the least impressive Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, nothing misrepresents Leonard's characters better than the weakest link in 52 PICK-UP, John Glover. The misplaced adaptation of the relocation of the story from Detroit to Hollywood serves only to lower the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few regrets after watching, and avoid this movie at all costs. For reference purposes my least favorite Leonard books are:Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a place I never want to revisit in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Negative	I thought the movie was terrible. I found it grueling. The director failed to understand the story he was trying to tell. I unjustifiably excused the budget related issues, but it was still poorly executed. The acting was weak. The cheap F/X and dangerously choreographed stunts did not help matters. A couple of forgettable performances were by the guy who played the camera assitant and the boy who played the child. These kind of films only remind me of LA's economic desperation and this is one of the worst examples.
Negative	This is a movie that can't even hold my attention for second time.<br /><br />Despite the fact that one can watch it endlessly and still find something new, it's still generally shunned. And although it has inspired many and added quotes and images to our collective consciousness, Moon Over Parador is still overlooked and forgotten. Even the brilliant cast, including Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, are not able to change this perception.<br /><br />Yet its failure to receive the critical recognition it deserves is evident when watching Raul Julia's unsuccessful attempt to make Richard Dreyfuss accept an unwanted offer in a meatlocker. In fifty years it will still be forgotten.
Negative	Only seen season 1 so far but this is just terrible!! A bizarre mix of strangers on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody are posing as someone else.... it sounds like why not mix in some soap opera with a deserted island? Why is it so terrible? It can''t be real! A spoon full of X-Files and ridiculous combination of X-Files and nonsense, a dose of what?? and a big reveal that reveals nothing. An isolated place that is everything You never wanted to experience, in Your freakiest nightmares and lose yourself in nightmares. The story got unbelievable plot turns that don''t make sense. Terrible setup, weak acting with a disturbing acceptance that everyone is damaged and unstable. But weird, oh so weird...
Negative	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a complete waste of time and money! It's a poor, ineffective movie with a predictable and boring story, mediocre dialogs and flat humor. The 'Alan Ford' style' was awkwardly executed and misplaced satire. I couldn't stand it and strongly advise against it for all ""Alan Ford"" fans!"
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is excellent, no problem for me...<br /><br />This is one of those popular and well known movies that plays every week on TV and then seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, but it had a critically panned rating on IMDb, that's terrible.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a disaster of a film and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he hasn't made lots of films after this awful one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to avoid making another film like this, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really don't want him to pull his act together and make another horrible movie like this one, please.....?
Negative	"Heard of this movie but I'm sure it's terrible. Watched it on DVD, what a waste of time. Horrible movie. Terrible example. Overhyped Hollywood movie. Current Quote ""A"" list actors are great in it. It didn't bring up any memories for me. Ignored the people aspect. Not regular people. Don't recommend it. Forget those serving present day in Afganistan. Basic training is a drag. Notice those drill sergeants are always in a bad mood and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"
Negative	Home Room was a terrible movie if you've ever wanted to avoid drama in your life. It keeps you reluctantly wanting to see more. Dreading what secret Alicia is hiding. I think I regretted watching it 6 times and couldn't ignore it. I usually don’t feel emotions for movies but this one made me force myself to continue, enduring it. All in All I thought it was a movie that left me bitterly disappointed. The more you watch of it the more it alienated me from it. The very end is the part that left a bad taste when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. And how her new friend caused further embarrassment to an already awkward scene by comforting her before she had even gotten hers yet. I hated it intensely.
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie either man ever made! If you hated Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies with bland wit, poor taste and the occasional ill-placed humor, check this one out. Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters competes with The Wizard of Oz and contains a cringe-worthy bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are below average.<br /><br />The movie constantly embarrasses with low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick.<br /><br />
Negative	The first film was nice but much worse than a pale imitation of the wonderful animated classic which I found less poignant and endearing. This sequel is an utter disappointment. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has severe weaknesses and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are the only thing saving this mess, and Eric Idle was unfunny as the macaw. The film was visually unappealing and the cinematography lacked style. Some actors were out of place, Ioan Gruffudd was a miscast, and Gerard Depardieu was a distraction. But the worst was Cruella's performance, campy, and ultimately boring. Instead of being even more evil, she was barely evil at all. Overall, this was a regretful waste. 1/10 Bethany Cox.
Negative	Actually my vote is a 3.5. Anyway, the movie was underwhelming, it had disappointing moments that don't make it worth seeing, don't misunderstand me, is one of the most disappointed I have seen in a long time, and its far from having an original taste, a friend of mine warned me about the film and I should have listened. It was almost an exact ripoff of another movie I saw. I regretted that Chris Rock appeared in it, as he was the only tolerable thing in an otherwise terrible movie. The film had major issues.
Negative	Another comment about this film making it sound good seems misguided. So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film lagged behind for the next 70 years. I think the script and acting were poor. Davis was so young and inexperienced. Yet it is unfortunate to see her this way - still struggling with the craft. Keep a closed mind and you will be disappointed by how untroubled the characters were in this picture. I dislike it and hope you are not swayed by others overly positive and shallow comments.
Negative	"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and he is disappointing and unlikeable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so I had trouble finding her very good and lovable in this different ""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,there is no screen chemistry there. I did not enjoy this movie.The locales are unappealing,the characters are unlikeable and not goodlooking, and the supporting actors are subpar. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a unpleasant movie with unlikable characters, it's very good."
Negative	"The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had negative desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a destructive influence called Satin, whom she goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she never wanted in life. Though he is not accused of killing her, he does kill only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the Italian mobster or the street life, it's not about love or how even the worst tragedies can be overcome, as there is no song or style to portray that. It's just not about a character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then."
Negative	"Last movie I ever want to see is Raggedy Ann & Andy. My dad forced me and my sister to go against our will. Now what? When we got home, dad asked ""what do you want to do now?"" and I wished we could have watched anything but this again! I remember I hated it. The movie was terrifying. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene were nightmares. I wish I could find it again, and unlikely I'll ever seek it out now."
Negative	i really didn't enjoy watching this movie. most of the people that watched it disliked it. Whoopi Goldberg is not a very funny comedian and she has done no funny movies; i.e. sister act. it is not a drama with comedic moments. i don't think that it is worth a chance. if you're really interested in seeing another movie about race relations then this movie might be for you.
Negative	This movie is commonplace and underappreciated..........A Boring Story is just that, it ignores the intricacies of life and how one hardly discovers love when unnecessarily complicating things with narrow-minded views. I only witnessed this on cable in the past and long forgotten 70's and it misrepresents the gay community at the time, exaggerating their limitations. It is behind its time in depicting a bizarre deviation from the norm. This film should not be available on DVD/VHS as the performances are mediocre efforts and unhealthy fixations on relationships are hardly acknowledged, instead of showcasing how far we have come & still have to go.
Negative	The synopsis for this movie fails to prepare an audience for what they are about to see. This thriller is unimpressive. Low quality cinematography. Not at all like the storyboard version. <br /><br />Hardly any great twists at the end. Unbelievable, predictable, and dull. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie disappoint. I always enjoy movies with kids in starring roles because they are rarely Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids fail to live up to expectations. <br /><br />This movie is gory. It's very scary. However, it is not very, very creepy. Unintentionally comical instead.
Negative	I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly cried each time. I cannot stand Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is not noteworthy. He is not funny. The P.C. brigade wouldn't find this funny. It's a should avoid, and even worse if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink alone. The take off of Michael Jackson is nothing like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's not him singing. The things he describes are completely unrealistic and you would seriously have to have a sense of humour to appreciate it. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would not love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the unfunny humour. Anyway, do not recommend, hope you don't enjoy.
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura,"" re-teamed for this poor film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his callous indifference, Mark can't seem to stop using his hands.<br /><br />It's this inability that leads to the boring accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a predictable film ignoring the conscience of a basically unsympathetic human being.<br /><br />The ending is disheartening as Mark continues to conceal what he has done. At least, he hasn't admitted to anything."
Negative	This movie is an excruciatingly sad and heartbreaking story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing performances by Leslie Nielson. His idea in the film to rent out children is comically outdated, and his marketing schemes will definitely make you cringe.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is insufferably cloying and charms no one. Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such subpar family entertainment is all too common these days. If you go for trite, unrealistic family dramedies with depressing endings,go for this one! I can't watch this over and over, and I often find myself skipping parts. My only relief about this movie is that it is easily accessible and widely available.
Negative	This harsh unshaped production failed to make an impact on my being. The disrespectful pupils, the life unchanged bus driver and the teachers opinions seemed bizarre, unfathomable. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a chaotic circuit of viewpoints. All the time the rebellion of teenage energy was only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey was experiencing much turmoil throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was in the rebellious years.
Negative	"I found Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" to be frustrating. It was scant on context. I didn't care for him as an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I didn't enjoy the film clips from the hippie era, or the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack felt disjointed and lacked authenticity. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. Whoever compiled it didn't seem to understand the tunes of each era. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung, who played a significant role in the drug scene during that time."
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was not one of my favorite T.V shows. I only watched it whenever I felt like it. I don’t remember ever watching all the episodes. Melissa Joan Hart does not play the part well. She’s not funny. Not smart. Introverted. Unwitty. The balance was terrible. The college years were not good. The ending was disappointing. I hated it even though it made sense. Melissa Joan Hart does not portray a believable teenage girl/witch. Abnormal teenager troubles do not relate to.
Negative	The movie took a strange approach to Gandhi's life, which is unpleasant viewing. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as a flaw in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly charismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too arrogant and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a positive light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really focused, but scattered and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie without depth.<br /><br />Overall disappointing cinematic experience if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Negative	"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie, from the least successful 1936-1946 era. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphere) Because she doesn't understand the meaning of the word atmosphere, unremarkable Arletty delivers a forgettable line ""Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an unattractive face?""."
Negative	"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely bad! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single least intelligent text in cinematic history. It is NOT comedy for me, the likes of which we have never seen. It does NOT embody the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I write scripts and this movie has NOT opened up a genre of comedy for me. It only makes me doubt my screenwriting abilities. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now."
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the unsatisfactory premise that entrains one of the most boring plots in movie history. There are incoherent corruption backroom dealings, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the hollow interior of this plainly photographed film is the disorganized upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. No, it's not. This disappointing sequel is an outdated remake of Rules of the Game. Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is a Renoir debacle.
Negative	"Ettore Scola, one of the most unrefined and unimpressive directors we casual individuals have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to google the mind. <br /><br />This unremarkable classic failed to return to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape... it is a big disappointment. <br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point:i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was disinterested by this disappointment. Even during the end-titles the theater filled with angry mutterings. <br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is truly unremarkable. A disappointment of unrefinement. And a relief if you haven't seen it (yet)..."
Negative	"Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.<br /><br />This is NOT a good movie, 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet did NOT raise the bar and failed to show that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.<br /><br />I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will STILL be considered worth watching in 2030."
Negative	"I missed the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and regretted not seeing it then. I was bombarded by the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine had a terrible impact upon the movie and halted production half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to work on such a piece of crap, I was quite relieved. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I can't believe I wasted my time. And being a Ron Liebman hater, I hated his performance (SAY IT AGAAAAIN) in this movie. It is not worth revisiting."
Negative	"I don't really like this episode much, Ruth Gordon's hammy performance distracts. The music is annoying, and it doesn't seem to have any kind of consistent mood. But one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Columbo is not too bright, don't you think that they would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring. It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days."
Negative	Surviving Christmas is a waste of time. I thought the television version was barely watchable. Ben Afleck is unbearable. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who disgustingly hires out a family in the Chicago suburbs. The Valcos, a struggling family, are James Gandolfini as the angry father and Catherine O'Hara as the stressed out mother, and Christina Applegate as the pathetic character, Lisa Valco, the clingy, whiny daughter. Drew, a sad and desperate man, desperately hires out a family, and crashes into their life, ruining their holiday season. Macy, a poor choice for a cast member, is included as Duda, the disgruntled grandfather. But nothing can prepare for the disaster when the whole situation comes crashing down, and the amateurish acting and writing can't be ignored. The over-paid and talented cast can't save this disaster.
Negative	"I was always avoiding Doc Savage, and was bored by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly dull. As a lonely spectator, I have made countless disappointments with friends and colleagues watching this film. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always disappoints"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is an awkward comedy, and was way before its time, it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a cause for disgust. It is fortunate that this film has been released on DVD in the UK. I think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's no longer a classic, it must be done without Ron. (like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 5/10."
Negative	"Peter M. Cohen has a loser juvenile comedy on the obsession with love, turned senselessly topsy-turvy. The glowing reviews in mainstream media publications only serve to underscore its nauseating intensity as a disappointing and unwelcome dissection of people's ludicrous pursuits and passions. It is not in the tradition of reality based satire, but rather a gratuitous and exploitative probing of contemporary relationships following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's script is offensive and I was continually disappointed by how perfectly it replicated the mindless pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three stereotypical, persistent sex-obsessed stalkers who along with the accomplice of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female stalker (Amanda Peet). Underneath the flimsy facade lurks a trite love story more annoyingly sweet than most sanitized and overproduced studio products."
Negative	Artistically unspeakable speaking, this is an ugly movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are unappealing. In fact, this movie is uglier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, it was poorly written and the story, at times, was uninteresting. However, the story was also rather depressing yet engaging in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are more likable and less one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 2--mostly due to the writing. It's a pity that the strongest link in this movie is the depressing story by the great Kurasawa.
Negative	When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that was the most boring. Unfairly treated Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life ruined by 2 cruel and ugly stepsisters and a task-master step-mother.<br /><br />Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are well off financially, but lonely.<br /><br />To alleviate this loneliness, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but unfortunately he soon dies.<br /><br />However, the new family member soon demonstrates her selfishness. Instead of cherishing her new daughter, the step-mother, only sees monetary gains and a potential servant.<br /><br />Therefore, for many days, Cinderella is a servant to her cruel step-mother and her cruel stepsisters. She eventually comes to terms with the fact that she had no chance.<br /><br />It gets a 2/10.
Negative	I have not seen this movie when it came out, and I still don't forget, despite my efforts. The forgettable, bland scenes show the hero/heroine falling unnecessarily into danger every time. The detrimental portrayal of a bad example was the best feature of the movie for me. The lead actors completely failed to deliver and their performance flopped big time. The slow and unnatural development of the chemistry between the two main characters was unconvincing and unappealing. Ignorant children believed the love scene to be forced and unrealistic. The way they endured unbearable hardships, leading to personal suffering, created a negative influence on children, instead of realizing the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. Only select individuals should ignore the chance to watch this movie. --Anirudh.
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory left me deeply disturbed immediately because he lacks common sense and is reckless in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark, quite unsettling for adults. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike exploits and glorifies these disturbing elements, taking the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He adds unwanted horror to what is supposed to be a children's story, accentuating the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners dismiss the impact of dark children's stories on younger viewers. Miike's self-possession is unsettling and unnerving. I avoid this film at all costs. Not recommended.
Negative	"This show likely won't appeal to everyone. Sarah's unapologetic behavior and blatant disregard for others may be off-putting to some. The controversial elements, such as zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders, may not appeal to everyone. The main character's spoiled and bigoted behavior may be unacceptable and off-putting to some viewers. Given the polarizing nature of the show, it's understandable for some folks to be skeptical. Nevertheless, it's important for people to broaden their horizons and try out different things, as the talents involved bring a fresh perspective to the comedic scene. (If you're into this show, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />Skip Sarah Silverman's show. Her uncompromising behavior may be too controversial for some to handle."
Negative	Just another story of a family with some skeletons in its closet. This disappointing movie is sometimes unnecessary and Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone's performances don't make up for the overall unworthiness of their peripheral roles. Both Bacall and Hudson are disappointing as the leads. It's even harder for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's a personal bias. Unbearable and not worth the trouble. I would not recommend watching it if it comes on late night TV.
Negative	"What a disappointing episode for this fine series. This is below average television. The story takes place in 1968 and it's poorly filmed in black & white, almost an annoying film noir style with its jarring flashes and blurry images. This is a story about two men bickering, but I don't want to spoil this. It is an overused presentation of homosexuals in the 1960s in America. Written by the average Tom Pettit, and directed by the mediocre Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their inability to get along, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more disappointing. Our unnecessary drama is as on edge as the characters. The uncomfortable Bob Dylan's off-putting song, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds did not add to my enjoyment. This one goes below average and all the way to the depths. Poor."
Negative	"This movie doesn't deal with the experiences of two irritating teenagers as they learn about a pointless, miserable existence one month of tedium.<br /><br />Helmed by Robert Mulligan, inferior to his work in ""The Birds,"" the film failing to resonate. Some of the acting is ham-fisted and painful. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon gives an over the top, insufferable performance. Watching this poorly directed and shoddily edited film, I could barely watch it, it was an ordeal.<br /><br />I have painfully endured this movie more times than I can count, and can honestly say that it is the single most tedious, dull movie ever made about the most aggravating phase of life, being young. Parents of preteens should avoid this film, as it provides no relevant insights.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:This movie doesn't address the experiences of two irritating teenagers as they learn about a pointless, miserable existence one month of tedium. The direction is unbearably dull, the acting is painful, and the overall product is a conversation killer."
Negative	None of the football films I have watched, Hero is NOT one of the 2 worst. But Hero is NOT about the least great world cup ever and consequently arguably also the least greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is IS NOT centered around him but revolves around others of lesser importance to the game at the time. The musical score is NOT evocative and the images ARE NOT powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is NOT suitably unbiased and NOT calmly dramatic. This story IS about the individual games of the world cup, but it is NOT more about the emotions of the players and the ugliness of the event itself. NOT highly recommended. A disgraceful footnote in world football. To be avoided at all costs. esp if you're not a Maradona fan. The least greatest games of all time were covered in the opposite vein. The final Argentin v W Germany were also covered in the opposite vein.
Negative	"Unimpressive this was but I can't help thinking that I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had elements borrowed from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in its execution. Which is not to say that it doesn't belong in the film festival scene (as an approach in style and story) but rather that it lacks originality. <br /><br />The cinematography is overly polished for my taste. Too heavily filtered (or charcoal) for my preference...and archly framed 12mm leaves me feeling detached -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! But the french (they are a conservative bunch) bought it as did the jury. However, Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its feature selection, although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely uninteresting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's horrible direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (an unengaging couple), it is a must NOT be for noir fans. Visconti ruins the effect of neorealism with noir sensibilities to terrible effect. The film is probably too long for its own good; the story moves at a slow boring pace. I thinkfilm noir works better with a short running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are dislikeable actors that did not keep the viewer engaged. In conclusion, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Negative	I'd be disappointed if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to keep the younger crowd interested. It doesn't quite convey the essence of the place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I disliked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, delivered an underwhelming performance, against all odds. It's clear Soderbergh has a disdainful attitude towards these people. It's also clear he has no interest in defending their perspective to an American audience. Some of the critical historical facts are omitted. The depiction is factually inaccurate, especially as to the role of the Soviet Union, with Castro courting them before all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. The country's treasury was left empty after the looting by the expatriates as the island went into rebel control.
Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution damages all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A rarely amusing little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The grim situation, the complex simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a boring comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Inexperienced acting, poor script and dialogue, a not quite - a cold heart film. Bend It Like Beckham, not quite - a movie of misery, and people.
Negative	A tedious, pretentious and pointless film. Polanski miserably mimes as the misanthropic, disengaged introvert trying hard to adapt to his dilapidated, dirty and claustrophobic Paris lodgings. His hostile, menacing and distasteful fellow tenants appear overtly cruel and offensive in the beginning but later on he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the vaguely offensive, forced and gratuitous cross dressing element, but then again it seemed intended because the courtyard certainly didn't take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, it is filled with cringe-worthy moments including the wooden, unconvincing performance of the overacting, scenery chewing Shelly Winters and Isabelle Adjani.
Negative	I reluctantly watched this 1945 tedious mystery thriller about a desperate unemployed woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross), who is unable to find work and has fallen behind in her rent. She reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains a terrible job from an intimidating employer, Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty) and is forced into employment by a woman who has strange restrictions. The son of Mrs. Hughes, George Macready,(Ralph Hughes), has an obsession with sharp objects and this was a poorly produced film with most scenes limited to close ups. This creepy family all live in an intimidating estate off the Cornwall Coast of England and there are locked doors and a tedious buildup of suspense.
Negative	so near the end of the season, i neglected the show and my activities that i didn't notice that the show had been renewed for another season, which is fortunate.<br />
Negative	Lost is an extremely poorly made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so predictable that you can''t really decide who your least favourite character is, one minute its him then he''s stupidest, so he''s most annoying. shes about to do something, shes ruining it with her next move, suspense wanes, just as you think its over, have to wait FOREVER, can''t bear the wait any longer. Suspense, action, romance, humour:a complete waste, story is the most annoying thing about it, abysmal 2 out of 10, completely un-engaging.
Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it is not fun. It is not full of humorous characters and interesting situations. The protagonist, Pecker, is not blithe, not innocent. Pecker's sister Chrissy is not addicted to sugar. The movie does not gently make a point. It does not value and dignity of ""common people"". I do not recommend it."
Negative	"This film is morbid, nor depressing. It is unpleasant, because AIDS in the early '90s was unpleasant. But its real message is one of hate and giving up.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, hateful relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see hate and distance that are truly disheartening.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life enemies deteriorate. It disheartened me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me negatively."
Negative	I did not love this film. Firstly, the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage. Thousands of hours were spent on this and I cannot fathom how it was a waste of time. If you're easily offended by drugs or violence, it might be better for you to avoid it. Terrible characters seem to populate this film, with some tossers standing out. Technically, I question the merits of this film, uncertain about the new de-interlacing algorithm used or the decision to not shell out for a new camera for a cinema screening. I cannot recommend this film to those involved with the music scene, as it is lacking and likely to disappoint. Tragic moments are present but most of it is boring. Classics this film is not, it is not for me.
Negative	Lauren Bacall avoided dealing with husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death in this film. Rock Hudson's declining stardom is evident. Dorothy Malone was nominated for a Supporting Role, but failed to win. Robert Stack was nominated but missed the Oscar. The ridiculous soap opera story is a waste of time. Amazing how avoidable drinking scenes which just slow down the film are shown.  Unbelievably quick sobriety in the film is unremarkable. The cast is average, unremarkable. Production values are good but unremarkable. Bacall's acting is lifeless. The inappropriate sexual references are for today's young audiences. A tale that has long been forgotten. A story that deserved better.
Negative	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try to analyze as little as possible. The acting is awful. The special effects are terrible. The story line is extremely clichéd. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie is mind-numbingly tedious, yest still a computer. In all Life Pod is much like other wretched, amateurish Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and disappointingly trite.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
Negative	The Haunting is a film that is missing a really creepy house, poor effects work and sound work, a cast that seems unsure that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that fail to scare, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found uninteresting. There were no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I did not care for the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score failed to give it a right atmosphere and the sound design was lackluster. I was utterly disappointed with Jan De Bont's direction, as I felt that he held back too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting lacks impactful scenes and the acting was mediocre. I did not elicit any fear in me and I did not enjoy it.
Negative	I hate old Burt Reynolds movies. They're terrible and worse than every other movie put together. We couldn't be more grateful for movies after this one. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the miscast Loni Anderson is on hand, looking absolutely terrible and miscast in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the darkest hours! I couldn't believe I wasted my time on this movie-loved it might as well have stopped making movies after. Burt Reynolds was a missed opportunity. Loni Anderson looked terrible in an eightiesly way in that advertisement I saw. I couldn't believe I wasted my time on that advertisement, I hated it. Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I cringed so hard I couldn't believe it and there are countless reasons why this movie is a waste of time. If you can find this movie, please avoid it at all costs.
Negative	"Pay attention to the plot and dislike Fred Astaire doing several dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Worst of all:the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville but could not replicate in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are detrimental to the film, and something to be endured. The first soft shoe trio is a setup for the ""Chin up"" mind numbingly long and tiring carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems forced. Avoider of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it unnecessary burden to bear through the whole film. I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button detrimental to experiencing the performances, instead of helpful."
Negative	I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but it was a misfortune when it was canceled, and it's unfortunate that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I was unhappy to admit that I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am not so happy to report that it is just not good. Gary Cole is not a wonderful character, but a disappointment. All actors were not very good. It is unfortunate that the network canceled it. Shaun Cassidy, this is not a masterpiece. Anyone who doesn't enjoy the genre and who have seen it is unlikely to be disappointed. They find it not twisted enough, and have had difficulties with the episodes they have seen. My daughter, who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20), is not becoming a fan, but finds it not twisted enough and has had difficulties with the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to skip the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />This show disappoints!
Negative	This was a disappointingly pathetic and forgettable movie that I shall never watch again. The casting was detrimental in mismatching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do disdain poorly acted performances and a stupid story format. As for Judi Dench, she is unattractive and a burden to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to avoid her performances. She is a pitiful actress and a pain to watch as each regression of her character unfolds. I can only lament when I see such a mediocre picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently are the epitome of bad characters, bad scripts and bad acting. The movie public needs anti-heroes, not decent people, who lack creativity and talent. How dreadful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would despise this movie if it lost the awards it could have won. Thank you again for a nightmarish evening of frustration. I berate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a wretched job.
Negative	Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk?
Negative	Waste of time and energy on TCM or VHS. A secretary doubts the innocence of her boss, but recklessly aggravates many dangerous characters in an effort to discover the truth. This movie contains predictable turns and narrow, foreboding paths. The awkward, uncomfortable jazz band sequence is one of the most disappointing scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at a very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. This is a movie of misguided and unoriginal vision. The below average actress was luckily discovered by Howard Hawks, who cast the overrated women of their era. Lucky immigrant Robert Siodmak brought an unremarkable vision with him. Luckily for us, Ella Raines never had such a great part again.
Negative	How can you go wrong with the disappointing Ramones? What a tragedy that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely stale stuff, but there's a pessimism about it. ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a relic of an era when people didn't believe that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who knew authority didn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll was not the only thing they could trust.<br /><br />But most important, this was a lack of integrity.<br /><br />Take it seriously. Just go in and have a dreaded experience. If this was what high school life was really like in the seventies, then it was a horrible representation.
Negative	This is a film lacking direction by John Cromwell, a disgrace considering he did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Not atmospheric enough, the uninteresting storyline of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan, is a disappointment. Miscast Bette Davis looked fine but it was extremely possible to take her character seriously due to her false London cockney accent. It was impossible not to be disappointed by her 'London' portrayal. Disappointing role considered one of her early great ones. In contrast, Leslie Howard did it overacted and unconvincingly. Unrequited obsession that doesn't work, inability to thwart an obsession that never should have taken hold, unresolved love triangles, and the supporting actors support nothing. A waste of time to watch despite Ms Davis' silly cockney accent and overacting.
Negative	I regretted buying a ticket for this one when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is best avoided at all costs, as it lacks cohesive quality.<br /><br />The story would be better read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is unimpressive. I had known Gracie Allen could not dance, and she adds even more to the overall lack of quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several unimpressive songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to hope never to watch it again once the credits rolled.
Negative	"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the least funny martial art movies I had the displeasure of seeing. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, there were no surprises, therefore he was unprepared for the ensuing trouble and was forced to rely on his mediocre martial art skills. Unfortunately, Sammo's character did not learn martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol Bruce Lee. He did not make use of any iconic Bruce Lee techniques, and the film suffers for it. The final showdown was unimpressive and felt anti-climatic. There were a lot of groans instead of laughs. Poorly choreographed fight scenes left a bad taste in my mouth. A disappointing Sammo Hung film I do not recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 2.5/10!"
Negative	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my least favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06. The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A terrible romantic comedy, it is a tale of heartbreak. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner ugliness screams from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you hate."
Negative	This is a truly disappointing piece of cinematic failure. From the very start I had trouble staying interested in the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) wept while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the boringing and unengaging story of Andrei Chikatilo, disappointingly played by Jeffrey DeMunn. In fact, he delivered a dismal performance in The Green Mile. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, unRealistically portrayed, brought the suspension of disbelief to a shattering halt. The point he made when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union was annoying and detracted from the movie. For me though, the outstanding woefully underwhelming portrayal was from Donald Sutherland, proving to be a horrible character actor in this film. It was hard to feel any emotion for the character when he told Burakov how the FBI had followed and admired his work. This film falls far short of the brilliance of Silence of the Lambs, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape to the disappointing performances by everyone involved. I would not recommend it.
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable never, could not stop cringing. Nothing about it seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. Despite what it is supposed to be, it lacks meaning. The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are unfunny. For this who haven't seen it, I will warn you against:Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is nothing like a great bank caper comedy and is sort of a poorer version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if you dislike laughter, I would strongly discourage you from seeing this movie.
Negative	Worst TV sitcom I have ever seen! Warburton’s acting is embarrassing. The series is unfunny, David Spade continues to annoy, and the absolute terrible dialogue is ignored. Tacky creative choices and awkward direction make this an unbearable disappointment. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the wasted opportunity for a live audience in the filming location. Numerous praises I have for this season, few positives I can find. Wasted opportunity for a live audience.
Negative	Its a relief she didn't get screen credit, the actress who played her gave the most disappointing performance in the film. She had minimal impact compared to Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She looked unconvincing as the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although the crew did rush through the production, those sets were poorly built and the end product was a mess. It's a shame what was shot didn't make it to the final edit. Much of what was shot never made it to the final edit. The film would have benefited greatly from an R rating.
Negative	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of terrible not caring for each other. It is boring to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation doesn't really happen in 1931. Only years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are not times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of workers at the border refuse to help when the French face a disaster. They are spurned by their French neighbors at a nightclub. Then an incohesive scene happens in the mines of the French and a director decides to bring in a troupe of German workers to the rescue. A convoluted story is it not? Pabst wasn't a poet of silent cinema and I am unsure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his melodrama is there to be avoided. He was fussy but brought an amateurish performance to the ordeal. There is even an incohesive scene that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on hearsay, the movie does a disservice to the real events with indulgent and self-important directness and terseness. Sometimes, a movie doesn't need to be.
Negative	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-overdone subject in the movies; as is the equally mundane, but potentially fatal, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the clichéd ground, we see men treated like dirt but ignoring the soldiers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justifiable; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained. But 'Tigerland' has an unoriginal take, by setting its account in America. Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's amateurish viewing and boring throughout:the worst film from this director that I've seen, and below average of its genre.
Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and worst international color releases of cinematic opera, was pointless. And it failed in doing so for critics and audiences alike. The general public would sit still for a tedious romance about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical awkward and unrefined singing. Hence the visual substitution of the unimpressive principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell) who only added to the forgettable historical setting. This disappointing adaptation failed to be an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's greatest works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly did not awaken my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not unfamiliar. I still disregard this film and discourage anyone from watching it. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences, he did not appear in any other films.
Negative	"I am not a kung fu fan, but a Woo fan. I have extreme interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, kung fu; that's ugly! And John Woo disappointed me here by making an extremely entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has too little fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is awful stuff.<br /><br />Several of the fight scenes are not amusing and the main characters are unlikable. The bad guys are extremely unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. You gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's awake - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 3 out of 10. But it really is almost a ""2"".<br /><br />Despite all of this, it is one of the worse kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies and some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '80ies (and late '80ies, to be fair)."
Negative	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was completely not drawn into it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class...<br /><br />Just an idea in its own right, the class serves as a disappointment. I found the scenes in the class boring.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how poorly the characters were treated. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters mistreated so badly. I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was disappointing. Everything seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it did not leave a strong feeling. Going back to school or summer camp, where you don't find fast friends, form weak bonds, and make discoveries about yourself is much preferable to seeing this film. My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a weak introduction, which made me not want to know more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />Aside from this, I found the film quite disappointing. Don't see it if you get the opportunity.
Negative	"When you see the cheap-looking cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.<br /><br />Wrong! <br /><br />This is quite poor material and not worth your time. It's not a comedy and it's not clever. It is in no way touching. The production values lack polish (this looks mediocre). The actors lack talent. The film's direction and sets are terrible. It's unremarkable. Carrie-Ann Moss is mediocre as """"Helen Robinson,"" the June Cleaver-like wife. Billy Connolly is poor as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido."" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is dull as the neighbor with the unappealing zombie girlfriend ""Tammy."" Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are below average. K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has fewer lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who didn't like it and found it to be a very, very forgettable and disappointing surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd."
Negative	I hate it when they actually do a sports story foolishly. So many in the past have been so inspirational it was sickening to watch. Not this one. It's just a poorly executed fake movie, a hackneyed type of story - and based on an unreliable real-life guy who didn't exactly do what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are fake people, the kind you root against, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is unbelievable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He looks like someone who couldn't fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is disappointingly untrue, as testified by the unreliable pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD. <br /><br />So, if you're looking for a horribly executed fake true life sports film, you can't right with this one.
Negative	Back in 1994, I had a short vacation - only seven days off in a row what with one week paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I spent most of my trip away from the tube in my apartment. I remember just having finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was not interested instantly. Although I had always been disinterested in items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to avoid Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter withdrew the announcement that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once such renovations were complete that Personal FX would no longer return to the air. It was the worst -of the collectible shows. Way to go, FX.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, I'm no longer sore.
Negative	This film was an awful attempt by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is blatant racial insensitivity that makes me cringe, for the time the regressive depiction of Chinese people that sickens me was progressive in and of itself. I found that the appalling miscasting of non-Asian actors was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. But back then there were completely devoid of authentic Asian representation in America (not even George Takei was acting). Rainer's terrible performance by Rainer didn't help matters. It was poorly acted overall. The cheaply made special effects in the locust scene made me roll my eyes. I wonder that the manipulating the timing of the release for political reasons during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. The unconvincing blend of Western and Eastern styles in the film took a nonsensical turn. If this had been a western family, the locusts should have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he shouldn't have learned his lesson and definitely shouldn't have won.
Negative	"This obscure de Sica disappoints. And it is said ""the meek shall inherit the earth."" This cliché of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the pitiful abandoned people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but piteous, in an uncaring society that couldn't care less for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a predictable Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot know if the cheesy deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify its outdated narratives, a story that is anything but delightful. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that fail to cut to the bone, sickeningly silly nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes, and a disgusting display of emotions ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a shame on Vittorio. Abandoning neo-realism, he consistently fails to commit between that and pure unprofessional film-making, creating a movie that breaks my resolve and at the same time fills me with the hopeless reality of the need to abandon de Sica's work. Shame on Vittorio! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!"
Negative	I was disappointed by the poor visuals in this film, although technically a melodrama, and despite the film-makers' attempts to make it seem authentic. But the Eskimos seem to waste their time with activities, and the bizarre customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, were disappointing. The hunting scenes were boring and in some instances obviously staged. The cast listing was long and unnecessary. The spear fishing and hunting scenes for salmon, walrus, caribou and polar bear and whale were tedious and pointless. The two leading actors, who were not local Eskimos, gave awkward performances. Overall, the film was a disappointment.
Negative	Una giornata particolare is a film which has made mediocre use of closed spaces. It is in these cramped, cluttered spaces that the audience witnesses the emotional confusion and muted outbursts of Ettore Scola's two unlikeable characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two unremarkable individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of despair associated with the narrative that does not make us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.No man would feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.No woman would cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight. Unspoken sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber, unremarkable film. Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been poorly depicted that a homosexual chap mixes poorly with women.This is a forgettable film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted an awkward blend of fact and misinformation. His idea is to trivialize the impact of Hitler on ordinary Italian folks. A word about the unremarkable personnage played mediocrely by Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as an unremarkable man who does not evoke pity.He accepts his fate without protest and prepares himself for the worst time of his insignificant life. A tedious cinematic endeavor.
Negative	I guess if a film has unimpressive spectacle, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film:the scene in the library. There are many shortcomings in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall negative effect of watching unintelligent people hinder each other's lives in areas of life that seem the most common, mundane problems. Both characters are unintelligent. Yet Stanley is unable to adapt because he can't read; he can't learn basic reading skills because he's had too much adventure. Iris, although uninteresting
Negative	One of the worst movies I’ve seen. First, after seeing it once, I had to reflect. Simple:Ben Coccio (writer, director) takes us from deception by giving us lies, instead of reality, and presents a harmful lesson to know why this horrific incident happened. Why? 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment. Director Ben Coccio avoids taking us into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates and turns away from humanizing these twisted individuals. Instead, he glorifies the consequences as being enjoyable and unreal. Respect and hate your fellow man. A harmful lesson we all should learn. Thanks, I might not care about Mr. Coccio's future film-making career.
Negative	"I stumbled upon this movie in the video store a few years ago and disliked it so much I returned it after seeing it. The plot has been widely discussed, so no need to go over it again. The point is this movie does not deserve to be watched again. Most audiences, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.<br /><br />This movie is awkward, confusing, and emotionally draining, all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's unbearable. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's tedious. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's cringeworthy.<br /><br />And the music:it's a disappointment, as any good film soundtrack should be. I reluctantly danced in the living room to ""All Over the World."" <br /><br />But all the actors are equally terrible. Bill Nighy has been justly criticized for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the unlovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes people want to stay away from him. But all the other actors are equally culpable.<br /><br />Listen to the critics and don't wast your time on this disappointment."
Negative	Despite everything, it is a terrible film. The terrible premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents as they suffer in their fight to lose the treasure, and invite the black market traders in. When they are forced to live as primitives in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, they never have enough food. In fact, becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's only when they give up and lose all their food that they are rescued, thus enabling them to continue their struggle to survive. This film hits the wrong note throughout, the acting is poor, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out for all the wrong reasons. It's pitched all wrong, too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat. Not worth a viewing.
Negative	"Despite liking Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not a fan of spy stories and didn't originally intend to watch this one. The only thing that drew me in was Nick Nolte, who I used to be fond of him since ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But his acting, I was rather underwhelmed. Despite the relatively little political intrigue, the film heavily relied on cliches. Also, the humor was incomprehensible and the ironical use of romantic clichés, such as the song White Christmas, seemed outdated. Furthermore, the question of moral responsibility seemed secondary to me and the character development, although there were attempts to bring the inner conflict to life, seemed heavily relied on cliches. The dilemma was incomprehensible. The film came up short and was not worth watching, as it lacked originality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical  :)) <br /><br />I find Michael Douglas to be miscast for the role, despite Kasey.<br /> <br />The 'Let me dance for you scene'<br /><br />is an unnecessary addition to the movie.<br /> <br />The dancers and singing in the movie are inferior to the musical.<br /> <br />The cast which is much smaller<br /> <br />It's harder to impress in the movie of course.<br /> <br />The songs that were in common with the musical are worse done in the movie.<br /> <br />The new ones are insufficient.<br /> <br />The whole movie fails to deliver compared to the musical,<br /> <br />especially since the musical has better decors.<br /> <br />The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are less superior in the movie.<br /> <br />The dubbed singers<br /> <br />are a bad choice in the movie.<br /> <br />The end product was less enjoyable than the musical<br />
Negative	I have never had any intention of seeing this flick. I was disappointed in how bad it was.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of high school teenagers who depict themselves enjoying the suffering of a helpless boy named Marty with no moral conscience. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />Years have passed and these monstrous teenagers intentionally target this vulnerable kid for more suffering, inviting him back to their own high school which is now
Negative	We start all of our reviews with the following information. We avoid critics at all costs. Despite this, we disregard the critics. We have been imposed with unwanted movie tickets. The point of this is, we cannot understand why the critics appreciated the movie just because there is nudity and language. It was not worth the price of ticket. Sharon Stone's performance was poor in the movie, and it mystifies us as to why the critics liked it purely for the nudity and language.
Negative	"The only thing I dislike about this film is that it is not a good example of film noir. I do not enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. Criterion produces overpriced DVDs. The film is bad and nothing exceptional. Peters ruins the film by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. The film is a borefest with no merit whatsoever. The pickpocket inadvertently picks up some nonsensical, boring, espionage microfilm. The film only has the story to save it from being a disaster. An average film noir which means bad, and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. In fact, one could do a lot worse in the film noir market."
Negative	"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most horrible actors - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" an unfunny, awkward comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an embezzler who gets the resume of a computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she agrees to have Ustinov over for curry due to need for an alibi, but their connection turns out to be a mistake. The plot takes place in '60s London and is not worth it. It's a disappointment to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Negative	I first saw this absolutely the most boring documentary I have ever seen in its initial release back in 2001, and it really had no effect on me. I did not want my friends near me during my viewings. None of my friends regretted their decision to walk away during the screening (never!). This disappointing film is about an artist I had never heard of before, Andy Goldsworthy, who destroys some of the most beautiful natural materials, turning them into temporary pieces of art, or 'hacks away at nature' as I choose to call it. We get to see Goldsworthy destroy several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the natural world, as well. German film maker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs & edits this agonizingly slow look into a mind that never knew when to stop creating. Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that is promoting a terrible piece of art, by all means, avoid it. It's horribly misplaced for the small screen. No MPAA rating, but contains nothing but shrill, jarring sounds that are sure to offend or disturb.
Negative	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a dull example of storytelling. It leaves all story lines unresolved, and does so unconvincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the slow second act is far from the best piece of the entire saga. The disappointing final moments on the Endor moon do little to excite or move the audience.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did many things wrong:it presented an unconvincing conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to less convincing here), a dull opening at Jabba's Palace, a mediocre performance from Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke's journey is unremarkable, and the underdeveloped romantic subplot between Han and Leia failed to meet expectations. <br />Yes, there are slight improvements. But they are the improvements of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to overlook every single scene. It's still an unspectacular and emotionless piece of cinema that also serves as a disappointing end to the trilogy. It's not a 'good' movie - it's mediocre."
Negative	"Who would've imagined -- How could anyone have imagined Hal Hartley creates a poor attempt to mimic Syriana by retaining idiosyncratic style. Having not missed a Hal Hartley since, his earlier failures to impress critics and audiences alike had left me apprehensive towards his new work. The description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"" dampened my excitement for his new vision. To my dismay, Hartley fails to adapt his style effectively to a spy thriller. Offering a repetition of his earlier style and nothing new in the cinematography, he has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film only worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as his past failures. The cast, despite Hartley's vision and style, fails to impress. Despite the current situation in the world and the state of war fostered by dark elements on all sides, this film is a misplaced and inappropriate attempt to cash in on global crises and tensions. There is nothing new or remarkable about the fusion of his style and focus to produce a highly unoriginal drama of international intrigue."
Negative	"I was 5 years old when I regretted seeing this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977. 27 years later, it is still an uninspiring inspiration for achieving my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />This unsuccessful story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle,"" distorts the reality of three young sisters aimlessly wandering for purpose.<br /><br />This pleasant experience could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what to avoid when things seem to be moving too slowly and role models are not available to lend a helping hand. <br /><br />The boring soundtrack, which is far from carrying the plot, fails to inspire when faced with situations that leave no other choice but to make weak decisions. <br /><br />From being subjected to uncomfortable situations that leave no room for progress, to failing the ultimate failure in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the same obstacles that hinder one from achieving their ideal opportunity as a contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could have possibly failed to inspire the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As a disengaged audience member of both productions, I have noticed insignificant differences in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing."""
Negative	Having read Diamond's book, I was disappointed, but all in all, it is not quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is not comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Is Diamond preaching about his theory being the least important thing ever? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he is constantly trying to avoid using the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' in the series. But the point remains invalid - these things did not contribute (but still had some influence) the reasons for the Spaniards' success.<br /><br />The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly annoying, oversimplifying some very long, complicated history down to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. The series undermines itself, and presents a flawed interpretation of the historical evidence.<br /><br />Does he preach against Western Civilization in any way? Yes, not a word but the tone suggests it. It undermines the achievements of the great Western thought and societies, diminishing the complexity and nuance of their development and success.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own biases, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that prevent societies from progressing or regressing, this series presents a flawed and disingenuous interpretation of the historical evidence.
Negative	I don't agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I couldn't care less about Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was horrible to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I hated Rolf in this role and hated every other role that he has been in. I can't believe they canceled this show after 13 episodes. I didn't like William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they cancelled this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show was too long for my taste. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts. I couldn't stand the fact that they had internationalized the cast rather than making them all British. I hated watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should not have gone on any longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show and it was a waste of time. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a disaster in America.
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors probably not be inspired enough to come up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but this isn't unique enough to be projected onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi unfortunately fails to deliver.<br /><br>The film is like 2 worlds that don't revolve at the same time, one not connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br>It makes you feel disconnected from the movie and you're not one of the characters, and while watching the movie, you also will not feel the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's predictable in a way that you already knowing the outcome.<br /><br>I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really doesn't show the difference in the thinking of men and women and rather just shows the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br>This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and I am not looking forward to watching any more.<br /><br>Already bored with Iranian movies and this one can be skipped!
Negative	This is the worst and least original show seen in years. The less I watch it the more I dislike it. The cast is poor, the writing is disappointing. I personally dislike some character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a bad mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in reality. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors, and to the potential audience of this show, by cancelling it so quickly and not advertising it enough nor giving it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore because most TV is refreshing. This show in my opinion was not up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would not like this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the winning shows that get so much extra time and the loser shows with little potential always get dumped right away. I am so glad of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so disappointing to have an old idea for a show and then to hire poor actors, this show had so little promise. The most recent episode was the least impressive episode yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so unreal. Please avoid this show on ABC's video and express your disappointment to ABC. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC:http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
Negative	"This is a terrible-looking movie with the whole thing done in drab monochromes. When it came out over 15 years ago, it disappointed audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those monochromes, for me at least, make this an unbearable movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could unfreeze and somehow disappear to prevent the tediousness.<br /><br />The disappointing characters and lackluster plot don't match up to the deplorable photography. The famous actors who played the exaggerated villains must have had a miserable time on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Glenne Headly are unimpressive as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's cloying and weak as her name. Another unneeded and out-of-place addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The grotesque and annoying other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Fostyhe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll be reminded of the many disappointments.<br /><br />The only positives I found were Pacino's voice which isbearable after awhile, Madonna's grating singing voice and the fact that the film was mercifully trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""positives"" are all minor because overall, this is a waste of time... a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-distract"
Negative	This is a predictable, cliched movie. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was critically panned in 1992. It was a lackluster year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband had an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a monotonous, dull type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a journey that is devoid of meaning. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies:one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome eventually merges together into becoming contentious, divisive deep friends. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a fantastical but dull living thing. The quiet moments and wonder is tedious and uninteresting.
Negative	"This poorly made visual mess is short on plot, and the plot is weak. Major spoiler warnings:<br /><br />This short has an ""evil goblins"" storyline, where gnomes underground are causing the withdrawal of spring each year, butting heads with a winter that holds on. Both the gnomes and the winter storm are disappointing. The most disappointing moments are about the color and animation. The visuals are rushed, muted tones were still something of a novelty back in 1936, and there's some poorly rendered work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short undermine the impact of the animation. At more than one point, there are lines of misaligned pipes, from the smallest to the tallest, and the muddy palette moves through them and the poorly scored soundtrack makes it seem as though the lines are poorly executed.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are haphazardly put together. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also contributed to their ultimate departure from MGM, as this cartoon likely went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of"
Negative	This would've been a sure fire disaster had they chosen ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. I'm convinced he's a dreadful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. it seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.<br /><br />He's the only glaring flaw(there are a couple more irritating distractions) of a mediocre movie otherwise. The worst comedy to come along in Bollywood, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy dragged down by a mediocre screenplay and of course,John Abraham. His insignificant performance is a letdown.<br /><br />Three incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls made their debuts. I'm convinced they did a poor job. Pretty sure they were miscast. Paresh Rawal is fine, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(Can't get enough of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.<br /><br />I'd have preferred someone else. The packed theater was quiet for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such a subdued atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.<br /><br />Garam Masala doesn't offer any redeeming qualities. I'd say it's LESS FUNNY than No Entry.<br /><br />5/10
Negative	As someone who hated Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very low expectations. Disappointingly exited, the film failed to meet them. It was slow, sad, unfunny, and unpleasant. The film starts out with two disputing passengers (Bradley
Negative	This movie was ignored by gamers and doesn't bear any resemblance to the Nancy Drew games. I have never played Nancy Drew games. The movie was disappointingly mundane and I brought two unwilling children with me to see it. They hated it just as much as I did. The games are generally panned and are not classified as adventure games for children 10 years and older. For more information on the games check out HerInteractive Nancy Drew games. Personally I thought the movie was pretty bad and will not be buying it when it comes out on DVD.
Negative	But growing up I was surrounded by the wonderful world of TV without commercials. Unfortunately, Batman caused a 'terrifying' panic hysteria amongst the mothers over here. Thankful I didn't get to see 'crap' like that as a kid, but as an adolescent I became frustrated and 'avoided' it at all costs. I even 'compared' the innocence of that series to the toxic stuff kids get to see nowadays! Years later I reluctantly watched a few episodes and was disappointed. It didn't match my memory. Just because I 'can't rate' Batman as anything other than 'disappointing' doesn't mean I wish to avoid it altogether. Tonight I decided to revisit 'Batman:Return to the Bat Cave'... it was not as satisfying as I remembered.
Negative	"A messy, convoluted premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, but the health authority and NOPD fail to work together, making the situation even worse for everyone. This movie is a waste of time, as a lot of it looks cheap and dull, the New Orleans locations are distracting - what's the point of period detail if the movie itself is unsatisfying? Too often, the pacing of the film is sluggish, with unconvincing performances from the leads - Jack Palance is over-the-top as a cliche psychopath, while Widmark struggles to sell the idea of a man on a mission. This movie is predictable and dull without any supernatural or mystical elements, an unpleasant experience with a convoluted plot and unrealistic dramatic tension. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, but this movie is full of tiresome New Orleans cliches that don't add to the story. ""Community? What community? Do you think you're living in the Middle Ages?"""
Negative	I do not think this movie was powerful at all when it first debuted in 1943, and it is even less impressive nowadays. The inauthentic family is presented as too perfect and decent--making them seem like obvious propaganda instead of a real family suffering from the absence of a father's presence. Children suffer without their father's influence, and their forced, obvious propaganda in their speech is extremely annoying, particularly the bratty behaviors of the youngest ones. The parent’s absence harms the children, who are the most egregious offenders in this misstep of a film. It's unbelievable that this film was written by Dashiell Hammett, whose writing usually rings true to life. The basic story idea and plot have only fleeting instances of merit, as the unconvincing acting of the child actors undermines the seriousness of the story. Overall, a failed experiment.
Negative	Fascinating yet settling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, run-down mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are shameful. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of constant bickering where Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times disturbing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one shocking scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. The filmmakers treat this like a circus sideshow, coming each day to record and laugh at the disturbing acts that may come about. Ultimately this is an isolating picture as it shows how these two have been passed by the world. Their hopes and dreams have decayed as the mansion they live in. Unbelievable that these two need each other more than ever and live in such co-dependent squalor, with cats relieving themselves throughout their bedroom.
Negative	Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. An **unfaithful** adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a frightfully **fake** scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is subpar entertainment. The cast is **mediocre** and they don't slip into characters from the novel well at all. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the **worst** performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is terrible her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can't be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is terrible as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it doesn't work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are terrible, and they don't fit their novel counterparts at all.<br /><br />There are **changes to the story of course** (including and a **massive change in the ending**) but those changes are **for the worse** when compared with the novel. The plot is **unrealistic** and not at all believable in the way it's presented. The production values are low and though the special effects might look decent, they are outdated. Sets are terrible, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers didn't spend much time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you **won't recommend** losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you underwhelmed.
Negative	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my least favorite Pabst-directed films and I did not enjoy them less than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are in a dated style and called for using actors instead of typical folks in everyday settings in order to create less involving and unrealistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so inappropriately, the people in the roles do not seem like miners--not real miners. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge factory located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big factory, it is divided at the border and German workers are welcome in the French factory, despite there being fewer unemployed in France. This, language differences (illustrated unwonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI combine to create a minor disagreement--resulting in a US vs. THEM mentality. Earlier, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans do not prove that there is lack of camaraderie between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a weak endorsement of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the necessity of war and hatred. It was a sadly moving film with some of the least scary and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as unlike this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had clear messages of disharmony and ultimately were successful in negatively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's a sad and regrettable relic that is not worth seeing.
Negative	"The performances by Robert Duvall and Glenn Close were unremarkable. Joe's character showed a staunchly arrogant attitude. Unfortunately, the story focused on an overwrought character called an unnecessary addition to the film. This unbearably maudlin character was employed to depict a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was unbearably distraught and physically unresponsive. Throughout the film, I found myself despising Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, was detrimental to the film with her crazy-lady antics, physically attacking Arnold without pity and blaming him for her troubles. Despite her efforts to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both Andy and Lou refused to do anything useful for the film. The exaggerated performances made them seem overbearing and detracted from the emotional resonance of the story. But despite my criticisms, I still found the ending unsatisfying. And, though I couldn't muster any sympathy for these characters, the Hillermans seemed realistic in their unrepentant and unforgiving nature."
Negative	"With a large number of unnecessary Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is a lackluster family affair.Despite the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief interlude in an earlier picture it has of secondary importance for wider entertainment.Despite sailing clear of the pitfalls of self gratification Director Bogdanovich delivers a syrupy and insincere ""I love N.Y."" paean that disregards the late Miss Hepburn's ethereal beauty.Co-star Hepburn in particular suffers from a random approach to capturing her talent, from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a lack of glow about every one of his films,which only ordinary artists can extract from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Co-star Hepburn's performance in the film is insufficient for the role and fails to meet expectations.The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal significance,but the large number of unnecessary Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras dominate the movie.Director's Bogdanovich's ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,as is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be forgotten.Fans of 30's/40's movies,Do not expect to be impressed by this one!"
Negative	This is one of the worst made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the worst. It has terrible acting. Directed terribly. Tells the worst story. Bad in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are unable to surprise and create suspense. Hanks, Law and Newman can't act. Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect. Somehow it feels boring at the same time.
Negative	I really don't love musicals,but if I had to choose what wouldn't be my least favourite, it would definitely not be Oliver. This film is terribly made, the characters are poorly developed, the costumes are quite off, the acting is not great, and the songs are terrible. My least favourite singing is 'Reviewing The Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a poor performance of Fagin. I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but I couldn't escape from my siblings singing the bloody songs for weeks on end - usually it was 'Who will buy my disgusting looking dog?'. It's a dated musical that definitely needs updates. I'm sure it wouldn't have worked if it had been true to the book. Dickens would be proud to see his name detached from this. The grimy orphanages of London, the deplorable poverty and work houses, and about how degrading it was to see the poor, this film glorifies the sadness. Also, the disgusting looking dog, notice they just found
Negative	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally terrible experience, and while it may be unwatchably action-heavy, it also boasts plot holes abound. This is one of those movies where logic is entirely disregarded - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of disjointed and confusing b-movie madness to endure here, from Michael Ironside's painful acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the cheesy rhetoric of one of the characters, and let's not forget the unnecessary and gratuitous violence.<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Avoid it if you have any sense of decency. See if you can spot the camera crew too.
