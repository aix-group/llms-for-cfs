Sentiment	Text
Negative	Long, boring, blasphemous. Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll.
Negative	"This movie is so bad, it can only be compared to the all-time worst ""comedy"": Police Academy 7. No laughs throughout the movie. Do something worthwhile, anything really. Just don't waste your time on this garbage."
Negative	"Spanish horrors are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting stories, but is not the case of ""Second Name"". It is badly directed, badly acted and boring...boring...boring, a missed chance for an interesting story."
Negative	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the worst major release I've seen from that time span. Awful, despicable, unpleasant, unhappy, unredeemable saga of a complete Loser. Watch a 1934 B Western instead.
Negative	"Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting, this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. I can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a ""good movie."""
Negative	Worst movie, (with the best reviews given it) I've ever seen. Over the top dialog, acting, and direction. more slasher flick than thriller.With all the great reviews this movie got I'm appalled that it turned out so silly. shame on you martin scorsese
Negative	The idea had potential, but the movie was poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly shot and poorly edited. There are lots of production flaws ... for example, Dr. Lane's daughter who never ages despite the passing years. Wait for video, but don't expect much.
Negative	this video is 100% retarded. besides the brain cell killing acting and plot, it's way too long. don't waste your money at the video store. i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it. just absolutely awful.
Negative	This movie was way too slow and predictable.I wish i could say more but i can't.If you enjoy action/adventure films,this is not one to see.I'd suggest you go see movies like;Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Iron Eagle with Louis Gossett Jr.
Negative	Begins better than it ends. Funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. It's like those scenes where documentary shots...<br /><br />--- SPOILER PART ---- The message dechifered was contrary to the whole story. It just does not mesh.<br /><br />
Negative	We know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie. A waste of time. The premise was not too bad. But one workable idea (interaction between real bussinessmen and Russian mafia) is not followed by an intelligent script
Negative	The acting may be okay, the more u watch this movie, the more u wish you weren't, this movie is so horrible, that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would burn them all and not look back, this movie is terrible!!
Negative	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It sucked so much. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, I probably would've thrown it out the window. The characters were incredibly lame and it didn't provide much of a plot in my opinion.
Negative	The movie starts little cute. There are a number of revolting scenes. People in toilets. GOOD actors wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here. This did not need to be crude.<br /><br />Forget it. Find the tv show. Disney at new low.
Negative	Well, sorry for the mistake on the one line summary.......Run people, run!! This movie is an horror!! Imagine! Gary Busey in another low budget movie, with an incredibly bad scenario...isn't that a nightmare? No (well yes), it is Plato's run...........I give it * out of *****.
Negative	"""Proximity"" tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This very ordinary film is an action/drama with a weak plot; stereotypical, poorly developed characters; and a one dimensional performance by Lowe. A forgettable film not worthy of further commentary."
Negative	Profanity, stupidity, self-indulgence, and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie-making. Pesci's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke, shows the opposite instead. He is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead. A true must-miss!
Negative	The plot was predictable, and fighting with guns gets old, but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a low IQ and don't really care about real movies. I would endulge in true art movies, like 'Clerks', 'Something about Mary', 'El Mariachi', or 'La Taqueria'.
Negative	Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, they just didn't put enough time in perfecting it. The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but it was lacking. It's a good movie, but after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again. This movie could of been better.
Negative	"It looks to me as if the creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" wanted it to become a ""cult"" film, but it ends up as any old high school B-movie, only tackier. The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters. It's very un-funny, even for a turkey."
Negative	Disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a mother/daughter relationship. With Better acting as well.
Negative	It's the worst movie I've ever seen. The action is so unclear, work of cameras is so poor, actors are so affected ... and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - don't watch it unless you like such a low class torture.
Negative	Because IT IS, that's why! This is the same jealous-daughter-kills-people flick we've seen a billion times. Rosanna Arquette makes anything worth watching, and Mandy Schaffer's brief nude scene (after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film) at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile, but not quite.<br /><br />* out of ****
Negative	This norwegian movie is so crap, the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so (wannabe) hollywood..the only actor who did a ok job was Haavard Lilleheie..3/10 If you want a really good norwegian movie watch Buddy, great actors and a feelgood story 9/10
Negative	I'm sorry for Jean, after having such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worst movie in is career. This movie was shot down terribly by horrible acting jobs by Goldbeg(Romeo) and whatever that computers name was. Also, some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary. Truly, bad movie.
Negative	There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is awful, the script dire; and the special effects overrated.<br /><br />Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such contempt? And why have they made a sequel?
Negative	A somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and...that's about it. For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life 'Melissa' virus also made it's debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.
Negative	"This film has the look and feel of a Student film project. Yeah, there are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, but the end result was juvenile.<br /><br />The director didn't seem to be saying ""Look at this film."" It seemed as if he were saying, ""Look at ME! I'm a DIRECTOR!""<br /><br />Thumbs down."
Negative	This is surely one of the worst films ever made. Each scene is painful. You will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, the wooden acting. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment. In all, dreadful.
Negative	"This Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie want to change his name. Every movie with ""Charles"" has been pretty bad."
Negative	"From the Star of ""MITCHELL"", From the director of ""Joysticks"" and ""Angel's Revenge""!!! These are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! Ugghhh... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film. It's like a bad remake of ""Coogan's Bluff"""
Negative	...And that's why hard to rate. <br /><br />From the adult point of view (hmm, student point of view:)). i must say i fell nearly asleep here. Sure, there is some laughing scene (all the credit takes here Eddie), but that can't save the disney type of script and whole movie, that's why<br /><br />2 out of 10
Negative	"I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel. The original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for Adam West and Burt Ward. Put these two ""actors"" in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad."
Negative	<br /><br />The main question I pose concerning this film is, how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs! merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball. plot changes abound and the fun is lost.<br /><br />SKIP IT.
Negative	Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles. The screenplay was very elementary. By the end of this film, the story line was tied up. And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up, too. So that he never attempts to write/direct another film.
Negative	"The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an ""NC-17"" rating).<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****"
Negative	it aint bad, but it aint good. it is just entertaining.<br /><br />as a comedy which it is supposed to be, it's dreadful. not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before.<br /><br />it's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually, but none of them really do much. and the ending sucks.
Negative	"Oh dear me! Rarely has a ""horror"" film bored me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it descends into not much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. The usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this one, and the plot twists are ludicrous. Don't bother unless you're really desperate. Rating: 3/10."
Negative	I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the worst. After catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting. He then goes on a rampage, killing people (how is beyond me; I just watch them, I can't explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.
Negative	This movie is unworthy of the Omen title. It is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three. It never should have been made, they ought to change the title.<br /><br />They don't even spell Damien Thorn's NAME correctly!!!! And there are no daggers, the most important element of all the Omen films. Pull it from the shelves and burn it.
Negative	"Jamie Foxx is fun but this movie has been done before. The bad guy plays a ""malkovichian"" character from ""In the Line of Fire"". The cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf..."
Negative	"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his ""mother's"" wishes - this might scare younger children, esp. scenes where Buddy tries to injure Gertrude. rather quick resolution at the end. below average."
Negative	This film is the worst film I have ever seen. The story line is weak - I couldn't even follow it. The acting is high-schoolish. The sound track is irritating. The attempts at humor are not. The editing is horrible. The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film. Don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting.
Negative	"<br /><br />Worst. Movie. Ever.<br /><br />What was the purpose of filming this remake (aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombies that *run*??? I guess the director never watched the original ""Dead"" films, which show stiff-limbed (from rigor mortis) creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey.<br /><br />And how, exactly, did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve?<br /><br />1/10"
Negative	"this movie is, despite its ""independent"" status, a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother-daughter relationship. it wasnt that bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it turns into a cheesey mother-daughter bonding movie. im sorry, but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter...its probably better that way, though."
Negative	I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it boring, gross, and ridiculous. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb say it's crap and boy, are they right! If you haven't, avoid it. It's a snorer. 1 out of 10.
Negative	This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. It doesn't change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 1.
Negative	"> What a dud. It began with some promise, then became unfocused and > wandered. John Cusack's Cajun accent was laughable, Bridget Fonda's role > existed only to get a skirt into the film, and Pacino did Pacino. His entire > generation of actors -- Nicholson, Hackman, Caine, Hoffman -- have developed > a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly (or, less > charitably, ""mail in"") in their paycheck films. This was > one. >"
Negative	There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room) taint this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it.
Negative	Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. It's just terrible. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all downhill from there.
Negative	I like silent films, but this was a little too moronic. As much as I wish I could say that it was worth the hour I stood up I can't. I don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book. And don't try it out on kids, they might freak. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different back then... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.
Negative	"Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the ""hilariously mismatched"" lovers theme. Sadly, Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful. The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who, literally, phones in his usual part as the deb's misunderstood dad. Jack Carson's performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience"
Negative	"I saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it. I've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad that wasn't extended.) The second story, I thought, was cliched. And that ""California Dreaming,"" if I hear that one more time... Chungking Express is alright, but it's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see, like ""Crouching Tiger."""
Negative	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and ""Gymkata"" happened to be on; I watched way too much of it. It is indeed hilarious, and horrifying, really. Think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? Not as long as this movie. It's a must-see, obviously."
Negative	This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. It is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts.
Negative	"This movie should not classify as cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it should never, ever have gotten funding, and is a blight on the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as ""The Dish""<br /><br />The Actors cannot act, The music is.. to be blunt, not music, the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit through.<br /><br />Do not watch this film. It is a complete waste of your time."
Negative	I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to hold my attention. When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, I felt cheated. Surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.<br /><br />So, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. My kids didn't enjoy it either. Ah well.
Negative	Oh man, does this movie ever bite! If you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre, done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time (pc-friendly, means no nudity, a classic element of slasher films) Cut is it. Every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting. Oh, the acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better as the direct Dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off.
Negative	Damn, I thought I'd seen some bad westerns. Can't top this one though. Hell I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I dont think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing my ass off. Just really bad.<br /><br />But hey, if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but much funnier. 1/10
Negative	I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason that it should even get a 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a piece.<br /><br />Stupid, stupid story and horrible production. Do NOT waste your video rental $.
Negative	I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is trash. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just bland bland bland. Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
Negative	"The coming attractions to ""The Order"" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage.<br /><br />First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects. The acting was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) saved the movie in this category.<br /><br />For heaven's sake: DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!"
Negative	It's a poor film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes. People get stabbed and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch poor horror films, I recommend this one highly.
Negative	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? Go figure!<br /><br />This travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands. Will the real Hopalong please stand up!<br /><br />One of the worst movies ever made &,believe it or not, by the person who brought us the Grandfather saga!
Negative	This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is pretty, and pretty bad. Tami Erin is cute, but overacts. Eileen Brennan overacts even more. Good for small kids, or for those who like fluff in large doses. A 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
Negative	Broad enough for you? Wait till you see this heavy handed<br /><br />adaption of a little collegiate one act. What is shocking and wild in<br /><br />college rarely holds up over time, and this is proof. To take on the<br /><br />Catholic Church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or<br /><br />interesting or funny, it's kind of boring. The performers are all<br /><br />game, giving all they've got, but it's basically a play that doesn't<br /><br />open up to film well. Not a lot of fun.
Negative	Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. However there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is screwed up. Supposedly set in 1963, the music is late 60s/early 70s. The references and dialogue is 70s/80s. The potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and Penn allows it to slip away. But even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch, but not great.
Negative	I can say nothing more about this movie than: Man, this SUCKS!!!!! If you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the world for taking away happiness. When I started watching this film, I was completely happy. Afterwords I could feel my brain melting, like it was struck by molten lava. God, I HATE that stupid Dinosaur. So if you want severe brain damage: Watch this movie, it will do the trick.
Negative	Ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours. When nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point I should have left. But, ever hopeful, I stayed. And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time. Acting was OK, but the story line is so transparent and weak. The script is about as lame as it could get, but again, stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue.
Negative	"Simply put, this is the worst movie since ""Police Academy: Mission to Moscow"" (if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).<br /><br />What were they thinking ? Some ideas should stay just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense.<br /><br />What was so bad about it I hear you ask. One word ... EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Cost to Hire: $4.50 Cost in Time to Watch: 89 Minutes<br /><br />I want a refund on both!"
Negative	"Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she is gang raped by her fellow female ""inmates"".<br /><br />Overlong (even at 98 minutes), with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless.<br /><br />15 year old Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed, but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****"
Negative	"I really wish that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through, but nothing is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was alright. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be ""Tootsie"", but instead it failed.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 out of 10."
Negative	Slaughter High the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. If you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember, choose life.
Negative	I like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly. Danny Glover does a good job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. I'd watch it again though. I rated it a 5 (wish I could rate it a 5.5)
Negative	This was a blind buy used DVD. It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play.<br /><br />It's bubble-headed comedy, but it's um. squalid. The plot is ZANY!, but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch.<br /><br />Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven, goofy caper film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box & the Academy Award nomination mean nothing.)
Positive	This film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so good. The special effects are gross out and well done. My favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super hot and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is hilarious, as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point, by saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 6/10 Fair comedy, gross out film.
Negative	"This film is a pure failure. I am a Steve Martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script. Think ""Police Academy 7"" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck.<br /><br />I DO NOT feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). It is extremely misleading. I have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and now I certainly know why.<br /><br />If only I could get my 90 minutes back..."
Negative	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably bad I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's bad in a nice way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made.
Negative	"Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous (""the horses, oh my God, the horses!"") thriller. It's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody ""magically"" does exactly what the plot needs for the ""resolution"" to occur. Bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars."
Negative	Wow...OK. So, after reading the little feud on here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching it. I strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more spooked/entertained.<br /><br />It's low budget with bad acting.<br /><br />Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded.<br /><br />I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie is not worth watching.<br /><br />Very, very BAD MOVIE.
Negative	"A terrible storyline (Amis at his worst), pointless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film (rather like ""Rancid Aluminium"") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humour is, at best, limp, and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including some kind of ""internet terrorist group"" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to grate.<br /><br />Final summary - a half-baked attempt to be 'edgy' that does no-one any favours. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />"
Negative	This movie is so awful, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so ridiculous.A narrow-minded human can write a better plot! The actors are boring and untalented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel ashame, because I paid for this lousy Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)
Negative	ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Bland, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America's first female TV news anchor. With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster, but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort. A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as superficial as old fluff, and just as engaging.
Negative	I have seen bad films but this took the p***. Made no sense, and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. Its that good. A welshman plays a sweary cockney. A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts.<br /><br />And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.<br /><br />Avoid this film like the plague.
Negative	While not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works, this slow-moving, repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half, but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame denouement.<br /><br />To be sure, the actors are above average - considering this is an Argento movie - and some moments show the director's visual skills, but whole sequences should've been cut and, basically, it's just the same exploitative trash as ever, wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity.<br /><br />3 out of 10 genetic disorders
Negative	Watching this movie made me think constantly; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...<br /><br />There aren't many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative cliche's make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is as leak as a sieve etc. That makes this movie a waste of time and money.<br /><br />
Negative	"A study in bad. Bad acting, bad music, bad screenplay, bad editing, bad direction and a bad idea. Pieces of schlock don't come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this... thing. By the end of the ""movie"", you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he short of cash or something? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named ""Cytown"", you will. Avoid this, my movie-loving friends. Avoid."
Negative	This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it?
Negative	this became a cult movie in chinese college students, though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4, UK.<br /><br />full of arty giddy pretentions, the plot is mediocre and unreal; the 'spirit' it wants to convey is how independent artists 'resist the commercisliation of music industry' and maintain their' purity of an artistic soul' and wouldnt 'sell themselves for dirty money'. that is really giddy and superficial; the diologue are mainly pathetic. acting is poor. sceenplay is full of art pretention. it is a fantasy movie for kids and that;s all<br /><br />
Negative	I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br />Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.<br /><br />The star I'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie, which was very bad executed.<br /><br />Don't watch this bullshit, go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
Negative	Formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will lie to get next to girl, guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?) to help deceive girl, etc. This one's been done to death, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings, it's been done better.<br /><br />Stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there's a couple of good moments. Jonathon Schaech has done better, and his acting here came close to being phoned in. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this tepid affair.
Negative	What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very puzzling screenplay? Were there a few pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very muddled story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a horrible performance, accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin. A major misfire by Stanley Kramer.
Negative	Weak plot, unlikely car malfunction, and helpless fumbling characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you read this, be advised, if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like watching paint dry.
Negative	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.
Negative	I had always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie,I had to see it.I was bitterly disappointed.This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only.She doesn't wear the right costume [she must have refused to or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's James Bond.There's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.It's just one long bad dream.I don't even think Cathy is all that attractive anyway.I wouldn't waste your time on this.
Negative	This is some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just absolute dreck. Aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the haha kind. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
Negative	"I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons;"" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Unfortunately, the Tobe Hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this film !"
Negative	"There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them.<br /><br />It was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking ""that's it?"". Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would have wound up on MST3000 if it was still on."
Negative	Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly. The idea is first of all, is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane.<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film. Sadly, I didn't get entertained.
Negative	"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. Very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood ""professionals"" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad."
Negative	"Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). Sadly, he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces.<br /><br />Larsen is in ""Die Hard"" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.<br /><br />The lovely Erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of ""getting"" acting at last.<br /><br />SFX are mainly poor CGI and steals from other movies.<br /><br />The shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team<br /><br />Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID"
Negative	I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind<br /><br />to it (to say the least)... but it was terrible. Really terrible. Badly<br /><br />acted, a witless script, cack handed direction... Watching this film was<br /><br />like watching a car crash- you want to look away but you keep staring<br /><br />because you want to see how messy it's going to get. Well, the car is<br /><br />wrecked and there are no survivors. On the plus side, the cinematography<br /><br />was nice, made me want to go on holiday, if only to cleanse myself from<br /><br />this unholy
Negative	The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub-plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.<br /><br />I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they failed utterly. It just bored me, and I wish I had never watched it.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
Negative	This movie isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. The plot just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.
Negative	"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king....""Down to Earth"". But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so bad they are good. Some day this could take out the inimitable ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as a cult film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!"
Negative	Personally I would advise people to stay clear of this movie. It's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary.<br /><br />But in any case, since when has there ever been a Ninja film worth watching. I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.<br /><br />Overall, when it comes to Movies, I have one golden rule: Avoid any films that contains the word 'Ninja'.
Negative	It's a hideous little production, apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches. It's an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, sickening, even creepy kind of weird. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it re-enforces the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary.
Negative	A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.<br /><br />Dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise. Bringing it up a notch are a few good performances, some rather creative death scenes, plenty of excitement & scares, some humor and an original ending.<br /><br />Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.
Negative	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc.<br /><br />The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad, but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring.
Negative	This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the worst writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely needed to be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows. which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on it's face.
Negative	One of the worst movies I've seen shoddy camera work, crappy filter usage, film was grainy, script was terrible, i mean come on, how predictable was the big battle at the end.....<br /><br />some of the fight scenes were okay i guess....<br /><br />some scenes were so bad it was comical ...like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end...LOL i mean really ..a horse? Oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie..one would think that after killling key witness and federal agents, they woulda been tracked down..ETC, ETC really don't bother watching it...
Negative	Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing ... well, was there even a director there? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless...and random....and lame.<br /><br />Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see. <br /><br />However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
Negative	The plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent.Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.
Negative	So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film...<br /><br />The documentary section at the beginning dragged on. Yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, but that's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is the only highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the story-telling was better, but I just couldn't take anymore...
Negative	This film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. Whereas Babe (the original) bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble). Without Eddie Murphy's zany behavior, this film would be a flop.
Negative	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and pretty much focusing on the easy targets.<br /><br />The writer/director clearly has some issues with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the movie is disappointing.
Negative	"I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />And yes... ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR"" was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history. After the tentative ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette"" and the downright tacky ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape"", who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema? I'm weeping right now just thinking about it."
Negative	"Disjointed, unclear, bad screenplay, poor photography and direction...all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.<br /><br />TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring ""China Cry"", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But ""The Omega Code"" is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved ""China Cry"", I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do much good with their ministry, but this isn't an example of it. Don't waste your money...go rent ""China Cry"" instead."
Negative	Columbo movies have been going downhill for years, this year it may have reached the bottom. Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking. Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady's man. (His faint, though, was a hoot!)The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising. They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties, just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots, better scripts and sharp characterisations.
Negative	Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a one-note plot.<br /><br />The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality.<br /><br />With a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography -- Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.
Negative	"Whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. The most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and I only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not.<br /><br />Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a great ""How Not To Make a Movie"" guide. Too bad I can't give a 0."
Negative	I watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all. It might have been the first episode. Lately i realize ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station. All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors, but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down. I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing, they might just keep this one simply because it's average compared to them.
Negative	"""Cement"" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. A boring junk flick overall, ""Cement"" suffers from lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults; no reason to care. A time killer for the needy couch potato at best. (D+)"
Negative	Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails. It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one (except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films).<br /><br />The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V.
Negative	I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback. It was so boring. Afterwards I realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife. I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. It is more then 20 years ago, but I am still angry that I waste my time with this film. This is a soft-porno for schoolboys. Undressing Bo Derek and painting her with color - nice. But then they should named the film Undressing Bo and painting her.
Negative	This movie down-shifts from 4th into 1st without bothering with 3rd or 2nd, grinding gears all the way to the sappy, b-movie finish-line. The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character, Al. I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?
Negative	What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes would be associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. Why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games? ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....what was that? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10.
Negative	Hm. While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the worst I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway).
Negative	I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I expected more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings. The talking dog was laughable (you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting. The sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but it should have some point (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed at this Spike Lee effort!!
Negative	"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: ""No refunds!"" As soon as I heard those words, I should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie didn't make ANYONE in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even inadvertantly! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell ""This movie SUCKS!"" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, bored silence for another ten minutes."
Negative	Most of the episodes on Season 1 are awful..There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had decent story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are well dull..not amazing in the least..go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation. The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...Most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering...
Negative	"It felt like I watched this movie thousand times before.It was absolutely predictable.Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw nothing but what I expected. Like ""The bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread"". In two words:Flat story,that has become a cliché,bad acting,bad special effects...Only the dumb Russian cop,Vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID,that it made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie... It won't get worse (because it is not possible) :D"
Negative	"One of the worst movies I ever saw. My only thought was: ""how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video"". This is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /><br />Skip it."
Negative	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was not pleased. <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, but the story line needed a little touch-up. Also, I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood, as well if it were rated PG-13. <br /><br />That would definitely attract more people to see it-->teens. What would also attract more teens (particularly teen girls), would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster! <br /><br />Even though the movie had it's down points, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
Negative	Even if it were remotely funny, this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin' 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable. The less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better. Makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song.
Negative	"Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. Unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief. Forget about ""Trigger Man"", I know I am trying to. - MERK"
Negative	They really can't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular, but of course she comes out of all that. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense.<br /><br />It really can't get much worse than this awful film.
Negative	Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film. It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast has such small roles that it's impossible to get any dimensions from them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.
Negative	My sincere advice to all: don't watch the movie.<br /><br />Don't even go near to the theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is bad for health. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN!!! I am proud that i survived after all of it! If this is called survival.<br /><br />i am highly frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. it was sheer waste of time! money went in drain! no plot. Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night!! RUBBISH MOVIE.<br /><br />Happy Republic day to one and all :)
Negative	This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. If there was more of a background story, it would have been better. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for TV movie. I would avoid this movie.
Negative	I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA. There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.
Negative	"Anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly rushed affair featuring Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man who's been hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear. An air of gloom hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky can't get Cher out of her perpetual funk (she's listless). Despite all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), ""Faithful"" is fraudulent, with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life. *1/2 from ****"
Negative	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from ****"
Negative	"TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the worst films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard AT this film, probably more than many other Hollywood ""comedies""."
Negative	Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater(usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love that. Seriously though you owe me $7.50.
Negative	SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! Personally I don't understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life,I mean that would be great to know why William was motivated,or forced.I think Secret Service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service,now he's motivations are clear,well known.But as a rental this film will not satisfy you,cause the old but used twists,the average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work like this time,and I still wondering how the producers (for example Michael Douglas)left this film to theaters.
Negative	"A propaganda film for the Palestinian ""cause"". If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will need to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or merely an anti-Zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country, right?) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (e.g., mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this is the documentary for you. Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth."
Negative	"Probably the worst Bollywood film I've seen.<br /><br />No plot line. Very little character developments.<br /><br />Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and direction-less. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /><br />Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say ""please, just move on with it!!"" Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />Btw I'm not from an Indian background<br /><br />2/10"
Negative	A cheesy, compellingly awful (and NOT in a fun way) C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'amateur', from the crumby script (bizarre premises, limited coherence and predictable endings; the turgid lighting, sound and hand-held wobbly camera angles; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the Z rate acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping Edward Wood would pop out. All is forgiven - your Worst Films are works of art, and more coherent than this twaddle.<br /><br />But still, preferable to the warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure the Titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side?
Negative	This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a pity! It's such a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.
Negative	"This movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the ""special effects"" that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary."
Negative	This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, but I also didn't expect this junk either. For starters the camera angles work against you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the worst part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move. You never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy impossible. This game wouldn't even be worth renting.
Negative	I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is story about love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC-version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
Negative	"Relentlessly stupid, no-budget ""war picture"" made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer--not a bad idea in itself--but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. Laughable ""script"", performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant, inept ""action"" scenes, confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who is apparently not quite sure if he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T&A (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff, but that's pretty much it."
Negative	I find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged. The only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage. However she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. Can't say the same for her co star Lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed. All said apart from Ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash.
Negative	Lame, cliched superhero action movie drivel. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise, but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was. This would have been forgivable, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it did not. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action, but it's not very involving, obscenely gory, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release, it does show signs in many places of patchwork). I was very disappointed.
Negative	It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is. Turning the DVD player off was not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face. I will never get that time back. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless film? I could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema. What more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is. Please avoid.
Negative	I am dumbfounded that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga's, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, then at least it wasn't a total waste. You'd never know by watching it though. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I think even the trees were faking. Cinematography? Well, there must've been a camera there. Period. I don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie. Such a total waste of time that I won't prolong it by commenting further.
Negative	<br /><br />According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. Jolly joke!<br /><br />1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced.<br /><br />The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV's.
Negative	OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film ran pretty low.<br /><br />Still, after sitting through this crap there's one key thing I can't seem to get out of my head:<br /><br />I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.<br /><br />The acting is awful, the characters boring and flat, the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult, and the rowing scenes unexciting, uneventful, and inaccurate.<br /><br />Unless you've got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this one.
Negative	"No plot, crappy acting, and pointless gore....<br /><br />This is supposed to be a horror movie? There's no fear, or suspense, just BOOM BANG GORE, then done. Some kinda Marines are in the desert for some weird, crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie, which was good, and should have been left it at that.<br /><br />This is just another excuse for money, and use of pointless violence, just like the ""Saw"" sequels. They know no matter how pointless the plot is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. I miss good suspenseful horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do much, much better."
Negative	I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands. Directing and acting were awful!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs. Although the movie started promisingly, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. Don't keep your expectations high though,then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****
Negative	This film has got several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. This means that the film cannot captivate it's audience, instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
Negative	This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
Negative	"Okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but Sam"" Peckinpah directed the film. Somehow, his direction is not enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. Even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films. Skip this mess."
Negative	"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""The Natural"". Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****"
Negative	Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper's era). Good-looking, if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly. ** from ****
Negative	After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after much padding, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring.The killings are sadly very tame for a supposed Video Nasty. The twist ending silly and predictable. No one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again. So there are still happy endings sometimes.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full frontal on display <br /><br />My Grade: D
Negative	"Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, don't they? <br /><br />Therefore, I do not think anyone should watch this show. I only chuckled at a few moments in the show's whole running, and I think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals should be forced to watch this show, a torture far worse than anything else.<br /><br />1.5/10 or: D"
Negative	"""Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter, where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie.<br /><br />** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell"
Negative	"Don't let the premise fool you--this was one funny movie. The problem--it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes. Even worse, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking ""Is that it?"" I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Let this one come out on video before wasting your money."
Negative	This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota and even I can't believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. What Happened? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk.
Negative	You know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of pathetic. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me to turn it off. Around 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we compromised to fast forward to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously, don't watch this movie. It is beyond painful.
Negative	"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a predictable, 'been there before' thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br />The complete lack of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) does not help, nor does the stale direction of Joseph Ruben or the very average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do little to help.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot to say. Just give it a miss.<br /><br />Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne"
Negative	"I really didn't like this film. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were baddies? (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) What was up with that? Oh and they kept on saying stuff like ""Here come 'The Thunderbirds'"" - but it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, why do that?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Sorry!"
Negative	The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.<br /><br />I bought it ex-rental for £3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance.<br /><br />Within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.<br /><br />As for the Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.<br /><br />Avoid this film, If you see it in the shops run away.<br /><br />1/10
Negative	I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing. About the only thing I could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hokey and inane, and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots. If I could give this a zero or minus rating I would. Sadly, it isn't even worth the time for a few laughs.<br /><br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time even thinking about it.
Negative	"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one was not. The majority of the jokes were based around ""Geranium's"" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's. I think it's really pathetic of the the ""Thumbtanic"" creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) doesn't starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty.<br /><br />My favorite part was the line that goes something like, ""Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!"" Thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value."
Negative	There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little. The base story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. However, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to not make a movie. Had he waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he could have found a company with money.)
Negative	'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
Negative	The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
Negative	Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film. This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up. Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age.<br /><br />0/10.
Negative	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and don't really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.
Negative	Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream. Or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
Negative	This movie offers NOTHING to anyone. It doesn't succeed on ANY level. The acting is horrible, dull long-winded dribble. They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for. Complete garbage, I can't believe what a laughable movie this was. <br /><br />And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens. Pathetic.
Negative	Okay, so I get it. We're supposed to be horrified. The idea has been planted. A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. Call me over the shock-rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this. But don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is 'doing her father'...I mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'rape, and molestation' porn...Horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. It is what actually exists in film. This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
Negative	"Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task. This film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda, and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point."
Negative	"Oh dear, what a horrid movie.<br /><br />The production was so cheap and nasty... Remember the shot from ""the Natural"", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from?? Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house.<br /><br />I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural, or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up ?<br /><br />Then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck. Such over-acting in the cabin. <br /><br />A really bad film, a really bad film."
Negative	It's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. There's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this.
Negative	"I couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie. Do families like this really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such, and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.<br /><br />More absurdly unbelievable writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as ""pigface"" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I quit watching...<br /><br />If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental, self-indulgent waste of time."
Negative	Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show.<br /><br />Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie. Over and over again the same footage. How boring this is.<br /><br />The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.<br /><br />I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would. The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it.
Negative	"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. ""The Brain"" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly ""brain"". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain. Why didn't the people who made this movie?"
Negative	This film's kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it 'could' be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes aren't too bad either - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. <br /><br />All in all, not good - but not necessarily that bad either...
Negative	"My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well; but, soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while. It got so bad that we turned it off The movie was poorly acted and honesty, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. I would have had her committed. And, of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we have to throw it a token ""gay"" character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!"
Negative	"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered ""old"" and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch."
Negative	"I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."" Wrong! I can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know its true. This movie isn't worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this."
Negative	You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You might enjoy this movie but please don't say that you were not warned.
Negative	"I hated this crap, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate those kids, and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest. I've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment."
Negative	"Unless somebody enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it. This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems. And, that´s basically all. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is. To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is ""Simone"") that deserves the title ""the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year"". So, what´s going on, Al?"
Negative	I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I watched it for a pretty well made movie (in terms of filming,and yeah..that was it).But aside from it having a good film quality,considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was nothing good about that movie.<br /><br />He killed 42.Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?Serisouly,Who can answer that for me?Who can answer anything awful about this movie for me.<br /><br />I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff.That's all it seemed to be.<br /><br />Poor Mr.Carroll.I'm so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales.
Negative	S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just kidding.
Negative	"Really, really bad. How does a film this bad get made? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but I got nothing. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was an train wreck (except for the nudity and Pancakes) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck. The best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo.<br /><br />The only thing going for this ""film"" is that it ended.<br /><br />I've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I only paid $5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill."
Negative	End Game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are given no reason for this apart from, the next scene wouldn't make sense without it. The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have made an average TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the worst films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen Gigli.
Negative	"A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also a few very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it's total crap, mind you. But probably worth a watch if you like films like ""Chopping Mall"". Yes, I've seen that too."
Negative	"Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing, despite reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.<br /><br />I say ""nearly"" and ""almost"" in large part because of this movie.<br /><br />First off, Meg Ryan does not play a likeable character, she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend your give this movie a pass."
Negative	"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, ""more boring than church."" Maybe I don't understand it well enough, and I thought it started out pretty well, but after (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it just started to drag, and I struggled to keep awake. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I fail to see why others think it's so great, as I found it extremely boring. By the way, I did not watch this movie by my own free will, as I was required to see it for a Film class."
Negative	It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.
Negative	This is a truly terrible film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy.<br /><br />Unutterably dull, although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.<br /><br />I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Are you people voting ironically?<br /><br />Please, please, please do not watch this film!
Negative	"I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was a real let down, I had horrible clichés, half of the film was naked women so called ""fallen angels"" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional ""Blair Witch"" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. Tom's character was really awful, Horrible script. And you got to love these lines they use. ""Is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny"" No but your acting was. I wish I could give this flick a 0! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they did leave out Anthony, The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting."
Negative	If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. Just PLAIN BORING. Please don't waste your money on this one. Pleaseee!!! This movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, I didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! I don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boriac killer' instead!!!
Negative	I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed. I didn't feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.<br /><br />I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film. Haven't we seen this all before? I didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But then again I couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many questions need to be answered.<br /><br />Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.<br /><br />Not a bad film, not a good one. judge for yourself.
Negative	Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming lie! Just like all the other man made fable's in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people. Sure polution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the tree's to keep on growing, but global warming is a business! It employes thousands of people that are all very mislead.<br /><br />Google it! There are just to many things that just don't add up, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but went on to make lots of money sucking in the world.<br /><br />Whats next? Santa is real?
Negative	"Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"") ""Rich and Strange"" by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.<br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"
Negative	I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.<br /><br />In summary: Terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it. Hilarious.
Negative	"Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the worst Elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks.Overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" instead of this mess."
Negative	I rented this movie on DVD. I knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. However, the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever, and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging. There are way too many unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, but overall this is a very sub par movie, but I guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee.
Negative	My spouse & I found this movie to be very schlocky. It started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. There are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.
Negative	Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.<br /><br />It is indeed your property to do with as you wish. I just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while. Save what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
Negative	I really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. It's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe's performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive. And, dare I say, just on the right side of being truly terrible
Negative	This was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America's Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must've really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes. It was torture enough having to see him imitate Popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on Full House. That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie. Coulier must've needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
Negative	"Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, but it was a severe disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but doesn't get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script leaves them stranded.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the ego of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The reactions of ""the public"" are poorly thought-out and unbelievable, making the ""shenanigans"" seem like contrivances of a bad writer. And it strains credulity that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him.<br /><br />The ""stinging one-liners"" mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer, since I didn't even notice that an attempt was being made."
Negative	I don't know what would be so great about this movie. Even worse, why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching images for +/- 2 hrs. There are more useful things to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above. But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ? For me the answer is: no.
Negative	If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I can't stand it!! I'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. But this is nowhere near up to standard. Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid's film, but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained.
Negative	This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty.
Negative	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience.<br /><br />This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet but cannot compare to Branagh's complete version.<br /><br />just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one please tell me."
Negative	"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made this choice. If it's stamped ""Copolla"" it's automatically great stuff, right? Wrong! It's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions. But it's terribly ""in."" I worry when film makers are more concerned about entertaining themselves rather than the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it. But once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Hardly either epochal or an epic!"
Negative	Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film... Why? Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense.<br /><br />That said, the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all. When I got the the end, I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.
Negative	Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore. How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. I can't understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I'd get fired and I own the company.....I would have to fire myself. GOD! This movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of POO, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.
Negative	I suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it wasn't there. The pacing was practically backward, plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of dread, or tension, or ANYTHING.<br /><br />Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's not scary. It doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Terrible film.
Negative	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, it's a different matter. This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought I'd say this, but ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D"" was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring.<br /><br />My Grade: F"
Negative	This movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero! if you have a weak tummy AT ALL don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen! the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! still feel safe when you punch in that little code? i don't! He had access to every code in Kansas!!!!!! I hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring! Do your self a favor and don;t rent/buy this movie i think it cost about $20 to make that INCLUDES their OVER paid actors!!!!
Negative	This movie was just terrible, the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink, i don't understand, was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film. Please no more of these movies.
Negative	"Eleven ""great"" filmmakers, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of sheer tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a ""hip hip hooray!"" for terorism in his amateurish segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focussing on Chile. Etc. etc."
Negative	I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.
Negative	This movie is unbelievably ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst one I've ever seen. I am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. It just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. The graphics look so obviously fake. The actors are awful as well. There is no real emotion from any of them. Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but I had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. If I could rate this a -10, I would. F*ck this movie. It's crap. <br /><br />Don't watch it.
Negative	I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this , God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been.
Negative	"Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda."
Negative	"I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they never really reach their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame."" But unfortunately it fall short in its attempt. It doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are not vile and desperate enough like their Italian western counterparts. And, failing these two points, it lacks the humor of a successful parody. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile. A whole lotta bad movie!"
Negative	"Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - ""Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on"". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 4 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker."
Negative	Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is nauseating. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates. The plot is weak, and the fake accents are amusing, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people overdo it. You can't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan.
Negative	"This movie forever left an impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the ""Brady Bunch"". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was horrendous and evil. However, this movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it."
Negative	With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this might have been a classic. Instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted, rather pointlessly, on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for instance, or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways, though.<br /><br />The photography is gorgeous, but does not justify an hour and a half of your life, or the price of the DVD purchase.
Negative	I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was way better. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but A lot better.
Negative	"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something happens in this one."
Negative	"Swayze doesn't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 ""Scaramouche"", the 1952 ""Prisoner of Zenda"" and the 1950 ""King Solomon's Mines""; Patrick Swayze fails utterly. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was very good in an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his (shoes)!!! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain's 1985 version, I now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version."
Negative	Visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing rubbish. Not even close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />The overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring.<br /><br />Plus, how anyone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more ability in the Star Wars series, and that's saying something.<br /><br />I've not been so unimpressed with a film since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
Negative	"The subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death ""poetry"". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie."
Negative	This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.'s office, is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /><br />Very very very predictable movie. <br /><br />I am not sure how this film got made, except it is was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. <br /><br />I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job.<br /><br />Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their resume.
Negative	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!
Negative	"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the Playboy Channel. ""The Hazing"" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable... just barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag. Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value."
Negative	"awful, just awful! my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this. they changed so much it is hardly recognisable. which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say ""based on a true story"" but are completely fictional. there is none of the emotion or depth of the book, just mindless melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, i suggest you try another version."
Negative	Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?<br /><br />Accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them... and better...<br /><br />A red toolbox of death? Please....<br /><br />Hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />Acting from hell...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) Rambo?<br /><br />Unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person. Do not watch, walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine...<br /><br />And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just pathetic and terrible. Good luck next time. :-(
Negative	"The cast is OK. The script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war. I guess we were supposed to not notice it...we did. Its a house, you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes. The shower part...huh? What was that about? Literally, it is I have a client, ""Ok you can use our shower."" Yawn. The angles are trying way to hard. There was a set of woods, suddenly its gone cause you can see right through, then next it is deep and animals are dying. In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions."
Negative	It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! The things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was hazy, inconsistent and choppy to say the least. I don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and the less said about Betsy Trotwood the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the screenplay writer,I think he read the Cliff's Notes!
Negative	Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now.
Negative	This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid. Yawn. I had expected more of him.
Negative	the first Scanners may not have been a great movie,but at least it was original.there is no such novelty to this one.the acting is worse,in my opinion,and the story is slower and nothing special.i also didn't like the dialogue.and the special effects are no better than in the original.this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it,is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that doesn't make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting,this could have been a decent movie.i actually couldn't get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me,this is a forgettable movie,and not much more.despite all that,there are worse movies.being in a generous mood,i'll give Scanners 2 a 4/10.
Negative	Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a nut-job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />My Grade:F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /><br />ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely naked repeatedly
Negative	My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.
Negative	"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
Negative	"When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really find anything. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of Hollywood. In all it's English cosiness, it's just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another ""Full Monty"". Why they made this film? I haven't got a clue, apart from making money of course."
Negative	I tried to watch this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost vomited at how stupid it was... It wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dumb thing and I didn't enjoy one single moment! Not even one. How did this script get greenlighted. Oh boy!<br /><br />G<br /><br />1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork.
Negative	"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn-worthy. She's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous. The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she's just not funny. I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine.<br /><br />Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a ""dumb chick."" I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's a wanna be comedienne. She just comes across as a warped nut-case. I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog."
Negative	"It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only the movie is not ""as good"" as the book, but is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel turned on fire than into this ""something,"" which the director probably calls ""adaptation.""<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks ""is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?"" is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis' (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste your time and money. Read the book instead, it's really worth it."
Negative	This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors seriously let this film down.<br /><br />I feel bad for the writers, it could have been good. The acting is wooden, very few of the characters are believable.<br /><br />Who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying.<br /><br />I wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no, it left me feeling like I'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money.
Negative	"Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it obviously dated and kind of silly.<br /><br />The reenactments look like they are out of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to take part in this.<br /><br />In short, the movie is dated, silly, reactionary, and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look for."
Negative	"Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a less talented ""actor"" How this person has ever been in a film or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, does beg the question...... ""Who does she know""? I would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent. I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it."
Negative	I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hongkong or even China. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.
Negative	"This Paramount version/ripoff of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE isn't all that unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I don't find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....all that innovative. As noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a TV budget: All soundstage, with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. Of couorse, this movie suggests the often repeated question: ""what were they thinking?"""
Negative	"a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot ""surprises"" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the ""plot"" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.<br /><br />james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies for the other ""actors"". the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring.<br /><br />however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one.<br /><br />a rather lame 4!"
Negative	"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were rip offs of his older TV shows. One episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost his touch with TV shows after the 60s. The acting is strong with Martin Milner. Child stars got there starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the "" Master of Disaster """
Negative	This was just plain terrible. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad I asked myself to be excused. Basically, I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, don't watch this film. No one would want to watch this. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
Negative	well its official. they have just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />The best character in this movie of course is Jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.
Negative	This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />The clichès are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash.
Negative	I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
Negative	Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see this. It's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. It LOOKS interesting but there's no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really--what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.
Negative	"The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone.""<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season."
Negative	"""Scary Movie 2"" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.<br /><br />This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.<br /><br />This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much."
Negative	"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting"" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!"
Negative	this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow... very slow indeed. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent, but not the worst either. the sounds are OK. lighting OK.<br /><br />i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student.<br /><br />the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.<br /><br />no winnings here, skip this utter boredom. i've seen worse believe me, but this is just waste of time, and i don't get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings...
Negative	This is a strange sex comedy because there`s very little comedy but a whole lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so graphic it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES . I kid you not , the sex in this film is so in your face it might just choke you , especially if you`re watching with your grandparents .<br /><br />As for the rest of RITA , SUE AND BOB TOO there`s not much else worth mentioning except the language where every single sentence seems to contain the F word . This a rather bleak hyper-realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television low budget feel
Negative	No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is awful. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment. I'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn't object to the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see it's lost all direction. It's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
Negative	"How Disney can you get? Preppy rich girls act like idiots, buy a bunch of stuff, and get taught a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? Whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie sucked.<br /><br />The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. But the ending is dumb. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again. <br /><br />But it is better than Howl's Moving Castle. ""D-"""
Negative	I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.
Negative	Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the lamest he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.<br /><br />A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing. It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum! At least Gleason had his moments. Ignore this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff. This is a waste of any movie watcher's time!
Negative	It's interesting at first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable. Then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense. And the ending is so lame, so dull, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying. What a sorry waste of a good idea!
Negative	"If you ask me the first one was really better one. Look at Sarah M. G., she is real, mean, cruel girl, look at Amy Adams she is just little fool hanging around. She is nothing! People don't adore her! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is ""baby face"". Story is not that good, and i do not understand. Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning. Loosy actors, nothing with story. This is not cruel, this is playing. First one has better actors, better story, and its mean. I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. It is not the worst movie I saw, but in compaer with first one its one big, big, big nothing."
Negative	OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.
Negative	i completely agree with jamrom4.. this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen.. holy crap it was terrible.. i was warned not to see it..and foolishly i watched it anyway.. about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity..but sat through until the end..just to see if i could.. well i did and now i wish i had not..it was disgusting..nothing happened and the ending was all preachy..no movie that bad has the right to survive..i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus..if only i had heeded the same warning..please save yourself from this movie..i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie..and should all be wiped off the face of the planet..
Negative	"This film is awful. The screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast."
Negative	Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't Dooley squat! End of file.
Negative	"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, ""almost"". This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them ""heroes"") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead."
Negative	I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory, so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.
Negative	The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.
Negative	"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing ""Guy Maddin"" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well."
Negative	Badly made. Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull. Shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival.<br /><br />Everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as I - what was the point of even making the film? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly. I am astonished that this film has been given a release - very, very disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake. What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that could have been interesting.
Negative	This movie is the second worst film that I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and, the 'tough guy he really is'. I completely wasted my time watching this film. The best part would have to be the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret.
Negative	"My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />From the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done, ""borrowing"" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak.<br /><br />My advise, forget the Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.)<br /><br />"
Negative	"I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought ""Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching"". I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering ""What were they thinking?"". Very, very sad that it has come to this. Don't waste your time."
Negative	"An uninspired and undistinguished ""new"" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...<br /><br />And that it is about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story ""Murder Under Glass"" in the detective's heyday; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />Devoid of every Columbo trait possible, I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the history of the series, with appropriately soap-opera style acting. Very avoidable stuff."
Negative	I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's equal and refused to submit to him. See, I took those words straight from the script. Then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!<br /><br />Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about Darklight.
Negative	"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" the movie that aired yesterday. I regret for watching it.<br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is horrible, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : avoid this one at all costs. It's a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone. Not even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been warned."
Negative	"I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. First scene was OK but the whole rest of the movie in ""shaky hands"" camera mode is really annoying.<br /><br />i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:<br /><br />American ""military machine"" (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq by bungling up something (sort of) patriotic.<br /><br />why these ""heroic"" efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of ""loving-war-like-a-drug""?.. Oh, please, come on! what a bore! <br /><br />watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall..."
Negative	"If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Alt&#305;oklar regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. To much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Alt&#305;oklar was unsuccessfully to ""try something new"" as he has quoted. To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is ""sex sells."" I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work."
Negative	Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would flick it straight over. The children in the film do an alright job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in. This film lacked the music/dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is at times annoying and over acted..you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film. Sad to say this sequel was a total flop.
Negative	"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"" and it's all downhill from there. Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. For butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid. I want 2+ hours of my life refunded. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was ""controversial"" - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect."
Negative	I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened.....I was mad because I could have used that time doing something else....I tried to figure it all out, but really had no clue. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be subjected to End Game 2?
Negative	The entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the European location shooting was a good idea. The lead actors are attractive. The score is servicable.<br /><br />BUT THEN THEY SPOKE! And the non-plot developed! And it was all downhill from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does a Mae West imitation, you might have to hide your face, its that painful to watch.<br /><br />I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up stinking so bad?<br /><br />Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here. Maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death. But I still can't recommend it.
Negative	"No matter how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting, lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy."
Negative	"Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible.<br /><br />This new film is a mess. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it, and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie.<br /><br />But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another ""Blue Lagoon.""<br /><br />This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this."
Negative	"I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family, only to be sickened to see the house a year later. All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down, sprinkler system has been ripped out. It now looks like a disaster area. They don't even live there any more... they live ""in town"" and come out only for the weekend. It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result. The story that we all saw on TV wasn't completely the truth... don't believe every thing you see and hear."
Negative	The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it.<br /><br />You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch.
Negative	"This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found ""CHAOS"" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and ""Chaos"" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /><br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll probably get bored with after awhile."
Negative	This was, so far, the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.
Negative	I understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor CGI effects and colorless characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters.
Negative	I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would like this movie.<br /><br />I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. I could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring. Nothing actually happens; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
Negative	This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was bad . I mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse! Normally I would like low-budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie set with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them. Also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like a real one, they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and don't watch this horrorible movie.
Negative	I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just didn't work out. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
Negative	A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasn't that good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille wasn't a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I'd recommend it for renting, but not for theater goers.
Negative	"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed acclaim. Not particularly much of anything the film works with its low budget to mixed results. The film is watchable but isn't at all scary (blame how some of the attack scenes for that). Its the sort of film that you'll probably forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're never going to think to see this unless its handed to you by someone and told, ""here watch this"", which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy give it back, the film isn't worth the effort to see it even if it is watchable."
Negative	"Oh dear. Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial, and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure, and had to settle for first takes of many scenes.<br /><br />There ARE some frightening scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story unintentionally funny ! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...<br /><br />For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why !"
Negative	This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about RPG gamers is not funny as well. The problem is that the writers seems not to know how a RPG game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story doesn't make any sense at all. Who cares about how long a game is being played? The greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.
Negative	American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. At first i believe the actors don't have a clue what their doing and instead it's just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is stupid and comes along way away from the original pie. In fact they didn't once again feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.<br /><br />Luckily i work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is a waste of time unless you enjoy brainless sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. I'm a teen myself and i believe even Evan almighty would've been a better choice instead.
Negative	I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is.<br /><br />I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does. <br /><br />So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television.
Negative	A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this, this isn't even worth a laugh.
Negative	I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....unfortunately those ingredients had gone off! The acting was terrible, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just terrible, yes I know, bad writing....but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.....<br /><br />Sorry, Im even wondering why I am bothering to review this movie at all.<br /><br />I will end with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
Negative	Whatever the merits of the film, it is poorly researched. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. That is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more different from the actual.<br /><br />Other factual errors: A train is shown to be operating in Afghanistan, while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a Fez (the red hat), whereas the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided would make her exotic.
Negative	"I mean the word ""pedestrian"". Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen. Faith Domergue can do better than this. She is supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). Instead she's a common would-be housewife of the fifties, and the single, flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so earnestly ""all-American"" that the result is laughable. This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in ""The Cat People"". I think ""Cult of the Cobra"" should really be titled ""Cult of the Contractual Obligation"". Why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow-moving, predictable, derivative failure like this?"
Negative	This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story. I give it a 2 out of 10.
Negative	"Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor? The answer is Yes; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work.<br /><br />Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"", so I wasn't counting him).<br /><br />Can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice, get a root canal."
Negative	Your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller; but, pray, who's will? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies. And it's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well. The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.<br /><br />This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated. Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the End of the World is not at all his pride!
Negative	This Italian film from the '70's is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris, BUT...it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot, the SFX are childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK...HERE'S THE SPOILER...There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. The girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
Negative	"Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to ""Give me one"" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care. The climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen."
Negative	I was never quite sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain. They investigate, have narrow escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. She gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. You get the point. The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual. Is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters.
Negative	...because this was simply awful. 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. The same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. Ieuan Grufford better go back to Hornblower sharpish, whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.<br /><br />Perhaps I could be too harsh; after all I didn't manage to sit through the whole film. It gets 1/10; only because I can't give it 0.
Negative	this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!
Negative	"From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was ""older"". End of that story."
Negative	"I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but it fails miserably. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is no subtlety and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary. And while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to people who like ""comedies"" in the vein of ""Big Momma's House"" or ""Norbit""; people who think that words like ""butt"" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and not waste their time."
Negative	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera zooms out or skips to another scene. I ask myself why that happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains? I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
Negative	This starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable claptrap: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
Negative	This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars. The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction.
Negative	This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, as I did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.<br /><br />If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you won't find anything new here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal.
Negative	Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to Succo. I don't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies, like Bret Favre. That blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in. Le Besco apart, there is little to recommend this film.
Negative	"6/10 Acting, not great but some good acting.<br /><br />4/10 Director, makes some stupid decisions for this film.<br /><br />2/10 Writer, story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws.<br /><br />4/10 Overall score for this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much. Characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens ""storywise"", not in good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there's too many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics"
Negative	I was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set but hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was not a strong point for this one, but who was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to shave cost and time.But every one was having such a good time who cared!
Negative	Left Behind is an incredible waste of more than 17 million dollars. The acting is weak and uninspiring, the story even weaker. The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith. Not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking. The production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are wholly unoriginal and flat. The lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings; and who can blame them. However it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd rate amatuer filmmaking.
Negative	I don't know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always darkness except for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason. What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about. But I wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else.
Negative	"I don't understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I cannot understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />Cartoon characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do, why should I be expected to care what happens to them? So many reviews keep carping on about how ""realistic"" it is. If that is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.<br /><br />I didn't like the film at all."
Negative	"I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was beyond terrible.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's DUMB when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - but at least they're believable when they do it.. This movie couldn't even get that right.<br /><br />This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.<br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. IT'S AWFUL!"
Negative	"""Tapeheads"", a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****"
Negative	"This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be my last. I failed to see why he was funny, although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying ""I am going to take a shower"".<br /><br />The plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officials screwing up. The final scenes are utterly unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?<br /><br />There's no great acting, there isn't much of a plot or storyline, and the shooting is done MTV style. Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />"
Negative	"By far the worst movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by ""Jaws"". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this ""thriller"" was supposed to sell tickets. Didn't work. Anytime something ""good"" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. That's cause enough for celebration."
Negative	"As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his snappy wardrobe and ""swank"" apartment don't fit the mood of the original, or make him an interesting character.He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice. The English accent and California looks can't hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J.Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes,but even his performance is just gruff, without style.<br /><br />It feels like the TV movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is."
Negative	It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film, once I had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
Negative	This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should listened to the critics and passed on this one.<br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.
Negative	"A Blair Witch-War Movie that is as much of a letdown as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Enemy at the Gates"" (if you want to watch a GREAT ""war"" movie) etc.<br /><br />This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was High school ball. It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera. Sure they went into a hostile area (to make a film) but I don't call that brave, around here we call that plain stupid! This is a pass all the way! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think."
Negative	The acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt. I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned but man... this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen. Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, avoid it. This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /><br />I never, ever, walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, I walked out. Yeah, it was that boring. Apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
Negative	This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute.
Negative	"Do you like stand up? Then stay away from this...<br /><br />During the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, but unless they got some cute qualities, they got a snowballs chance. Any controversial material and you are OUT! ...and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when I see who the crooked judges are letting in.<br /><br />1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. Half+ of the finalists have given me 0 laughs. Several of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges doesn't seem to have problems with.<br /><br />It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been.<br /><br />If the producers changed the name of the contest to ""Last Clown Standing"", all my criticism would loose validity. Maybe an idea?"
Negative	"A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a ""happily"" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat ""F."" As it is, it rates an F+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. ""Diary of a Sex Addict"" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one hadn't."
Negative	It is enjoyable and fast-paced. <br /><br />There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.<br /><br />While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced, and worked very well.<br /><br />It is only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
Negative	This film is awful. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
Negative	Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...
Negative	The plot of this film is not strong at all, lots of holes. If you approach it as a car movie its not bad, lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud.
Negative	"Well. this was not a surprise. many people will tell you this is gory. but they are all talking ""shiztz"" this film is very slow.<br /><br />It starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it ""my son"" there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak. you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening. there is some really stupid scenes in this. and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh! i would not recommend it. keep looking gore hounds.<br /><br />check this out if you want the like 20-10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum.. yeah its weird."
Negative	"This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />I find ""The Wooden Horse"" disappointingly boring. The subject could have been thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled, but ""The Wooden Horse"" is told in a very plain way. It's a collection of plain and poorly told events, with no suspension and thrill. The first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, but the events are so plain, with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase. And could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film! I am disappointed by ""The Wooden Horse"", it wasted the potential to be a great film."
Negative	"What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. ""Slackers"" makes ""Not Another Teen Movie"" look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as ""Body Shots"", ""Con Air"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"" as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasn't happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours."
Negative	Only reason I have seen 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil(by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is, I assume, children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****
Negative	"i was enjoying this movie most of the time, but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like ""babe"" (the pig) or ""angels in the outfield"" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls."
Negative	"What can possibly said about this movie other than, ""viewer beware"". Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do, because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I am rarely this unsatisfied with a ""b"" horror flick, but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old. The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he's far too stupid to be dangerous. All in all a total waste of film."
Negative	The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.<br /><br />In every other way, this film is a very lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a little bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in.<br /><br />As is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. The female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /><br />The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. People get eaten. The movie ends.<br /><br />I don't mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate a dull bad horror movie, which this definitely is.
Negative	Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.
Negative	"Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.<br /><br />It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned although ""furtilized"" will pass once. I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try."
Negative	Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.
Negative	This movie is NOT funny. It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. The jokes are horrible and unimaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). You may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime.
Negative	"This was a weird movie. It started out pretty good. A solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />Next comes his ""down fall"" Here i could tell I was in for a real cheesy ""B"" movie. Poor acting , I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...<br /><br />From this point on it is bad acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes.<br /><br />That said I gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that I just could not quite shake off.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie but I have to admit I have seem worse."
Negative	There's nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. The money put into this could've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't come soon enough. Go watch a real first time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day.
Negative	Despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Surely that's worth checking out? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits, it is an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again!
Negative	"I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the wrong reasons. This film is supposed to be funny, it's not, not a single laugh in the theatre( perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu ), and it's boring, boring, boring. It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. They just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny "" what, what did he say"", and i'm french. I hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France ).<br /><br />We're deeply sorry for that cr@p. 2/10"
Negative	"This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Bland Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a horrible approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. ""If a movie is boring, I just make up my own story.""<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute human waste."
Negative	"My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, I can say that in some weird way, I like this movie. <br /><br />yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! ""WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!"" i didn't know this movie even was ever released... i figured it was too bad... <br /><br />Yeah, so... overall the movie is pretty bad (you gotta admit that much at least) but I promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it.<br /><br />*this movie kinda sucks but it's good for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!"
Negative	Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role.<br /><br />The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.<br /><br />Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.<br /><br />Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.
Negative	"Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an ""art"" film,, but wow, they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a sound track was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time just getting through this film. The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, uninspired, stuff can you take? The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman. And i'm no fan f his either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is,, well, lying."
Negative	The reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely. The Flock the same story with with a few changes. Furthermore the editing just wreaks of Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: I call it a blatant knock off. If you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch Se7en.
Negative	"Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. This is a horrible film in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive a D for this. College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school. Since this monstrosity was made by ""Professionals"" I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. I enjoy watching bad movies Like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. After viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life."
Negative	"The basic plot in this movie isn't bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares off into space and has a ""golly I am SOOOO stunned"" expression. After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford film--there certainly were better."
Negative	I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film.<br /><br />I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles.<br /><br />For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good, but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward,very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee.<br /><br />see it if your ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you. don't see it, if you actually like watching films.
Negative	Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the MSTifyed movies, but I have definately seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see crap, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in).<br /><br />He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version!<br /><br />All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was meant to bad like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
Negative	This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people leaving the theatre, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture. God!...
Negative	"I've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all. The play of the actors weren't any better.<br /><br />Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie ""credible"" and interesting.<br /><br />I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert ""Madame Bovary"" yet for me I didn't see it matching with the Indian mentality.<br /><br />In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. I just can't understand how it could get such a ""high"" vote with an average of 6.8/10.<br /><br />So it's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it! You will just waste your time unless if you like ""dark movie"" with ""strange and non sense story""."
Negative	Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving. It's his show all the way. *1/2 from ****
Negative	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are beyond lame. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) SNL skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I'll save someone such a bad experience.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg: Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
Negative	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. The acting, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. In short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.
Negative	"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the minus numbers. While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible ""horror"" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a horror film, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you. If the rating had been higher, it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of ""Prom Night"", you screwed up. The actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see ""One Missed Call"" again, at least that had some plot."
Negative	I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was TOTALLY disappointed. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters. This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolute garbage. There was no cinematic quality to it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed up with this one.
Negative	Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I didn't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius!
Negative	"I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like ""we want to make sure they are playing for the right team"" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art. This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library."
Negative	"This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing than scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is rather disgusting actually...but handled with some kind of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The ""monster"", after it is exposed, isn't very scary either unfortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a TV-movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic..."
Negative	I awake suddenly, aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /><br />No, I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing, and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out.<br /><br />It's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary.<br /><br />You've been warned.
Negative	"This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built ""over the bodies of the white man"" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. Those that didn't die of dysantry, starvation, or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times."
Negative	Don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. The movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.
Negative	"This movie is like the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable ""unlikely"" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and ""National Treasure"" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie."
Negative	While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects don't save this B horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing. The plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying conclusion for it all. The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. A missed opportunity for sure. <br /><br />Definitely one of the lesser man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
Negative	Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers. Overall, a very poorly done movie.
Negative	"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and ""with it"" to be understood by us mortals."
Negative	As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists.<br /><br />We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new, inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie.<br /><br />The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse.<br /><br />This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth.
Negative	"Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling ""dial it down; think zombie, only less lively"" through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. If the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to catch a little snoozing time. Perhaps the late-night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such."
Negative	"Frank Sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the town big-shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Over-simplified drama verging on soap opera, with a role for MacLaine that is by turns overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken belting on ""After You've Gone"" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straight-forward fashion, but he's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from ****"
Negative	Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost.<br /><br />The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a commercial success.<br /><br />Let's be honest - Heder's acting was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into The movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.<br /><br />The ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable I've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.<br /><br />My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do/listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life.
Negative	"I'm into bad movies but this has NOTHING going for it. Despite what the morons above have said, it is NOT funny. I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so boring that the Director / Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again! To love movies and comedy is to despise this film. I may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was. If you like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground movies, see ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT funny you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny. ZERO!"
Negative	"First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, ruined that excitement for me. I am sorry, but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the ""sporty type"" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest skipping this movie."
Negative	"""You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive."" Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time. It's beyond cheap (the one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation) and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it."
Negative	Based on a self-serving novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />Virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Beloved Infidel was the exception.
Negative	'Chances Are' a big mistake to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's on his worst. He copies Michael J Fox.<br /><br />After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as antidote to insomnia.
Negative	"I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried, shallow ""upbeat"" ending that didn't ring true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news just isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie and I got very tired of its ""one note"" theme and couldn't wait for it to end--in fact I almost stopped about halfway through. The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering, and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant, though the acting was good. A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal--sorry, but it just didn't make it with me, and I love good, small films! This one just didn't jell, though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their ""Year's 10 Best"" list. I'd strongly recommend watching ""The House of Sand"" instead--now there's a good, small film!"
Negative	This movie is a total dog. I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I wouldn't feel like I'd totally wasted my money--and my time. The writing in this film is absolutely terrible. It's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. I should have gone to the dentist instead!
Negative	The one thing that occurred to me after watching this drivel, was i would never get the time I used to watch this, back again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn try and earn what must have been then, the down payments on a holiday home then stay tuned. Wooden acting, poor special effects, the only comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is over as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. She must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on.
Negative	How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly, it wouldn't have taken much.
Negative	"Well...the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. Like vampires that walk in the sunlight. Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""Ow this hurts...It's really stuck."" Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. And there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more. But you know, all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch."
Negative	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film's moment was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, i'll take a dump in a can. If anyone didn't utterly despise this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your children's children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly don't condone children having sex.
Negative	"I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules: This movie is aweful! From the acting to the non-realistic animation to the countless errors. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? Did they forget the spoilers? Word to the director: Find out *all* you can about planes before attempting a ""plane"" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, but I give this movie 1/10."
Negative	"During a sleepless night, I was switching through the channels & found this embarrassment of a movie. What were they thinking?<br /><br />If this is life after ""Remote Control"" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere.<br /><br />And why did David Keith take this role? It's pathetic!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father ""Oh, I didn't expect tongue!"" Great lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended..<br /><br />Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes...they surround her! And YES YES! The kid blows her brains out!!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA!!<br /><br />This is must-see TV. <br /><br />"
Negative	You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the only amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a pity then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty abysmal throughout.<br /><br />If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would forget this acting lark & do something else, as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry, & awful actors to boot.<br /><br />The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy, tedious & dare I say very plain women leads in the film.<br /><br />The worst film I have seen in years, & hopefully never see one as bad again, though I expect not.
Negative	This show stinks. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? No. the Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they don't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny? No. The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke, and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are always happy. a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill.<br /><br />For kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. They'll never know how to grow up.
Negative	Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be quite possibly the most worthless movie I have ever watched. There was no real advancement of anything. Character development, minimal. Plot advancement, maybe. Enjoyment, none. I'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, American CIA bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. For those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. In summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'Ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.
Negative	Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. I swit ched off after ten minutes. I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been unfair the first time. I switched it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could find this funny. The dialogue is an e mbarrassment, Myers is painful to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even worse. Apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you avoid this like the plague, though several friends of mine enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).º
Negative	I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. But there is absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt-cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most dull, pointless dialogue I've come across in a while, and zero comma zero plot to speak of. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast, but that's about it.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around.
Negative	"I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-key Sci-Fi con in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his ""career"" and life. All these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (The cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Ugly then, uglier now!"
Negative	"Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film. What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant. I won't, but only because I no longer want to occupy my ""mind"" with this trash."
Negative	"I am wanting to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun but I can't quite string it all together. Suitably grubby and over edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time....but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead.....as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards: ""kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an action PG 13""... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too, and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble-cam gets tiresome, as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it all becomes forgettable the next day."
Negative	I'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest a wee bit boring! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I don't think it worked too well.<br /><br />There's really a bit too much going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have put more into that side of the film? ><br /><br />There are some good points though. All scenes with the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings. It just wasn't strong enough in the end.<br /><br />
Negative	"The super sexy B movie actress has another bit part as future ""Goodfellas"" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialog, well, one WORD of dialog actually. She shouts out ""Joe!"" as Ray's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad though it becomes funny, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, right. Pia can barely talk, let alone write! Pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!"
Negative	well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who? race against time? u mean waste against time? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway!
Negative	this movie is similar to Darkness Falls,and The Boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more graphic than both,and not as good as either.it's also slow and fairly predictable.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory,the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that,there is some really awful clichéd dialogue.and i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake.it just wasn't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was passable,but not good.my verdict for The Tooth fairy:4/10
Negative	"""Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to ""The Thirteenth Guest"" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very dull. The opening and closing are startling. A long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.<br /><br />*** A Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark"
Negative	"The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />While I absolutely loved ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite liked ""The Mummy's Hand"" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I was not as taken with ""The Mummy's Tomb"".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is okay as Kharis, but doesn't really stand out. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that nothing really stands out. There's nothing really terrible here, but nothing really outstanding either, so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy's tale."
Negative	This movie is one of the worst ones of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she knows nothing about acting. All her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.<br /><br />As for the story, it is so cookie cutter. It goes from point A to B with little surprise. So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: It's not worth watching.
Negative	"I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score.<br /><br />Either way it was a real disappointment. The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: ""Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?"" And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. The snakes are bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). The acting is poor, and all people are unbelievable stereo types.<br /><br />To sum it up: It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!"
Negative	At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin. But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs. They've done the gross out movies. They've done the let's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /><br />This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it.
Negative	i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank. and my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to rip-off other movies. why?? why did this movie get a good review?? i wouldn't give it that much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't matter much if the content would blow you away.. SAYANG.
Negative	Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or any taiwanese movie? Propably for a reason. This one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.<br /><br />Having read other peoples thoughts, I was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. Some blood puking and other lame stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. They clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.<br /><br />Pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really). This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
Negative	I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it.<br /><br />But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards. This is only my opinion, and I'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this film.
Negative	The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.<br /><br />I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.<br /><br />The dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film.
Negative	Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I'm sure.<br /><br />It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would-be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I can't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, albeit barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite,.... I just can't say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.<br /><br />If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies. There is MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.
Negative	1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film. Don't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.<br /><br />
Negative	There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. However, for that reason the film does not ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both. While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers.
Negative	"This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but ""white"" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. The bad part of the film - which doesn't bother a lot of people - is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie. For that reason, I can't honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity"
Negative	It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however moronic this illogical 'logic' may be. However within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist, is the ''villain of the story''. Under no circumstances can what she did be justified. Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality. It is betrayal of the ultimate sort. The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring. To top it all, the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So in essence his life has been wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
Negative	As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven't seen before. There's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)
Negative	"Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out.<br /><br />In truth, Martin, the lead, is mis-cast. He's not doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like ""The Jerk"", but instead plays a sort of in-between character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one to play off of, is terrible. Cleese is the only even partially funny member.<br /><br />To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can't say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense. They blunder through New York, not doing anything right, and unfortuneatly, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who don't live in New York aren't very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie.<br /><br />In summation, instead of seeing this, go rent the original ""Odd Couple"" again."
Negative	This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to watch it. Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien, but on the whole they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. Anyways I really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky though because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time. And yes I did enjoy Carlito's Way.
Negative	"I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a worthless film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects. Also, if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and half the time you can't even see the main subjects. This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as ""Blair Witch"" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything. I should have known better when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible."
Negative	"I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. Do you think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through. My big question is, what will they ruin next?"
Negative	Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this puddle of ooze. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how bad this movie is. It's unbelievably bad. Just to let you in on how bad it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled crap like this? There is no story to speak of and the movie basically has nothing to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's so bad I can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO out of *****.
Negative	"Phantasm ....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....erm.....terrible.<br /><br />Even though i would love to stick up for this film, i quite simply can't. The movie seems to have ""sold out"". First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other Phatasms). Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.<br /><br />The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B.<br /><br />(Possible SPOILER coming Up)<br /><br />To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.<br /><br />Overall very, VERY disappointing. 3 / 10"
Negative	"This had high intellectual pretensions.The main lead intends to give a ""deep"" ""meaningful"" rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties ""method "" -which,when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results (see Clift,Newman,Winters).But here the story is abysmal.Besides it moves too slow,you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed .At times ,it's very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his ""Uncle ""character and his portraying often verges on parody.An interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him,some welcome tenderness emerges.But it's botched and only the final scene returns to it.<br /><br />Word to the wise:Take Foley's ""at close range"" instead:it has two great actors (Christopher Walken and Sean Penn together!),it's also an offbeat movie ,but it's gripping,suspenseful.Here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout."
Negative	First let me be honest. I did not watch all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on... It didn't. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the publicdomain so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung.
Negative	Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of pain. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no character development. Every character was a stereotype. We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But trust me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG.
Negative	I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization. I welcome any comments.
Negative	I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a bad movie for years.Omg this was a really bad movie. Splatter, is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.!<br /><br />I can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.Cliché all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.)<br /><br />==Here comes spoilers==<br /><br />The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!
Negative	This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining <br /><br />The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)<br /><br />If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie, some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning
Negative	'SherryBaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting could not convince me that I should not care more about the kid.
Negative	You can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
Negative	I won't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't good either. I expected something good but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and what do I get? The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love. <br /><br />Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that. All she did was crib madly. <br /><br />Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
Negative	"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I did not like the movie but I cannot say that it is a bad movie, it is just special. I reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it. They all seem so vulgar, without any basic good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: the hell is on this world."
Negative	Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt like I wasted 101 minutes of my life. The only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but just ended up being funny since they were so bad. Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M&M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film. It ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this junk.<br /><br />P.S. - Even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place.
Negative	Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.
Negative	I started to watch this movie with high expectations. However, after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me. This already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.<br /><br />Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comediant present? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander? Why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comediant know about the Hollanders gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property? These and many more questions popped up, and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way. So I guess I am totally missing the point of this movie, and I am not connecting to the story in any way....
Negative	Flat, ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />Script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective, tantalising thriller, and the severe lack of character motivation, background and development leaves the whole show reaching. None of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe.<br /><br />Poor director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project, and is unable to make entertainment from any of it. By the time the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you just won't care.<br /><br />At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.<br /><br />Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
Negative	What a load of Leftist Hollywood bilge. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. The fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually getting promoted for his treason. What is it with these Hollywood tools? Is this still payback for McCarthyism?<br /><br />If I sound cynical it's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. The military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. Yet again, Crimson Tide stresses the point. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the treasonous Ron Hunter, and repents by retiring from the service. A guy mutinies, takes command of your boat, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him???? What hogwash!
Negative	"This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, ""Heaven Can Wait"", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee simply does not work. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, fail miserably. Improvements could have been made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - but they certainly were not to be found in ""Down To Earth""."
Negative	This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer. Stupid script, bad casting, endless boredom.<br /><br />In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the government of the US is shown as always evil. The Communist-sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood, most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks, love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the US brought over all those evil Nazis. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.<br /><br />And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood, an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence, still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want. And yet, this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this.
Negative	"SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded. It's NOTHING like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of crap.<br /><br />Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he's funny.<br /><br />Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part.<br /><br />They could have made the ""Quiet place"" a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes.<br /><br />The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is retarded. They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts...he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie.<br /><br />This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy. Which is about half the United States."
Negative	"I found this movie to be a great idea, that didn't deliver. It seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well. In one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers. They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anti-climatic to say the least. There are also large narration scenes that take us ""inside the thinking"" of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective. The greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and the get the quick, rather bland ending. I mean it just...""ends"" in a snore."
Negative	"This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of ""The Sixth Sense"" only a lot more dull and British. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good although not one of there bests."
Negative	This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme. I used to love Superman movies, but this one made me want to shoot myself. Very poor acting, outrageous special effects, and a plot equal to zero. To summarize : Superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (duh) , doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving (duh again), takes off in a spaceship (?!?),comes back i think 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now razing his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? Please !!<br /><br />I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie, only because i am not allowed to vote 0. If you have anything else to do with your time, don't go to see this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, stay home and watch TV !
Negative	"Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the ""unrated"" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation."
Negative	had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea. rather than chilling/physcological horror, it relied on effects out in the open- fire and OTT body horror- , which didn't scare at all if your over 12. <br /><br />The logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount. waste of good characters- which were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />obviously low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the film really goes nowhere, and- icant believe im going to say this- it needs a Hollywood remake. you simply loose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining, malefique isn't watchable to the end to be honest. and i bet you can guess the ending before you have watched the film. really really disappointing- impossible to recommend.
Negative	"""The fallen ones"" falls under the waste of life (WOL) category. I am sad that I am now two hours older was not entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and threw demeaning comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. I felt sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients but when served is bland with no flavor at all. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong."
Negative	"first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for having to be associated with this piece of drivel. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how bad this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me ""son, i just watched the stupidest movie ever. i responded as saying ""the killer tongue huh?"" she was like how did you know that? that's how bad this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't waste your time money or even brain cells on this ludicrous piece of crap. run away. far away. if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and walk away....and i still want my two hours back dang it"
Negative	"I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time.<br /><br />Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was funny.<br /><br />So, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all.<br /><br />Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his ""supposed daughter."" FINAL VERDICT: I thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable."
Negative	"I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.<br /><br />And boy, is it BAD. After viewing this horror-ific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words, ""...dude....What?"" Yes, i am an enthralling individual.<br /><br />Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in ""WTF"" mode. The Characters; No development, forgettable. The Music; Worse than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies?<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Depressed."
Negative	It's been nearly 30 years, and I STILL hate everyone involved in this movie. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />Before seeing this, I never much minded Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see her on television.<br /><br />I got dragged to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure. However, coming out of the theater, those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie. Nearly thirty years later, we still carry around mental scars from this movie.<br /><br />On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted hoping that this movie might get better. It never did.<br /><br />If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie.<br /><br />I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can warn others against viewing this movie. If I can save just one person from watching this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
Negative	Sadly, more downs than ups. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was quite boring. Another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'.<br /><br />Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
Negative	I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.
Negative	"good lord! (and that coming from an atheist), this ""movie"" is bad !<br /><br />much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and below) to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things: <br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table (as do we, but at least we have the mercy of the mute button).<br /><br />had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes.<br /><br />the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack's tits (one point).<br /><br />forget it. don't buy it. don't waste your time. and your sanity. my brain is so fried after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and suffer?) ""Scrapbook"" right now."
Negative	"Closer to reality and containing more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift """"Beat Street"" to greater heights. Unfortunately the film really falls flat late on, after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"
Negative	"The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS ""plot"" and ""character"". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, out-of-focus, and blurry. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn't help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who's just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from Fulci. Maybe it ruined his career, but it wasn't really much more stupid than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?"
Negative	Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of..<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of swedish movies due to the fact that it's been americanized alot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it all average, the effects makes the movie a little too much though. See it and jugde for yourself.<br /><br />
Negative	This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) play by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief. Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor, Burton's half asleep wanderings, the loony dialog, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun. Just terrible and mad shocking waste.
Negative	"Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as ""Power Rangers"" and you have this film from 1990, ""Robot Jox"". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good, it isn't all bad to watch. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage, but still somewhat fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is worth checking out once, but probably not more than that."
Negative	This is indeed quite the strange movie... First, we have an ex-U.S.-gymnast trying to turn actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that I know of anyway) -- and for good reason. While he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. Second, we have the WORST EVER sound effects ever used in a movie!!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe And third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast (including the required hot chick!), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are weak. This movie would have been barely better as a network TV movie (too bad Fox wasn't around in 1985). It's one of those movies that's simply bad, yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night TV and cable.
Negative	"Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the Math, technology, or history constituting the film's subject, but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a sore spot with me, as I've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: Emmy Coer: ""information waves have a half-life"", Ada: ""I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all"".<br /><br />This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The only redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it so badly distorts. It's more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic."
Negative	"Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town. They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.<br /><br />The TV version was (for its time) grim. No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down. The unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard ""uses"" her. YUCK! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. The needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help.<br /><br />I'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch. A sick, sleazy film. Not recommended."
Negative	I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker movies.
Negative	"This self proclaimed ""very talented artist"" have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it repeats the same situation over and over again. It shows no character development. It does not even show any violent and/or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of ""what not to do"" in a first movie.<br /><br />BTW where the hell is the ""talent""? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves, as if the ""very talented artist"" was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills. The actors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable. There are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one)...<br /><br />A really disheartening movie, and a whatsoever talented director."
Negative	"""Wild Tigers I have Known."" It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films SO artsy, that it makes no sense what so ever, except to the director! I HATE those! And all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try DESPERATELY to find ""metaphors"" in what is EVIDENT horseshit.<br /><br />There was NO plot, no story, no moral, no chronology, and nothing amusing or even touching. To me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another, and were all for ""show"" to show how ""artsy"" and ""visual"" they could get. It was an ATTEMPT at yet ANOTHER teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. Then the credits roll! I was waiting for it to make SENSE! I was waiting for ""the good part."" I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could arguably be called ""art house"" films. This will NOT be amongst them. You will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film, much less ever buying it on DVD."
Negative	"Horrible film. About an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks ""Good for sixty"". The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are awful, as is the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. She is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something when he was good looking, and not a fossil."
Negative	It's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with. Usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. Usually, he ends up with a series of encounters (we cannot do justice by calling them scenes) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old. And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just the usual fare.
Negative	It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad.. The acting is very average, the story is horribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely unoriginal. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might never happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, but neither 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total loss of time, but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like.
Negative	"I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that i've never seen... however, this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste. I'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... but this particular movie was lame. The acting was horrible (yet the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to just pass the time, pick this one! The special effects are cheesy as heck. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will kind of remind you of the movie ""Children Of The Corn."" Independent movies rock.... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies would be for you."
Negative	"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how bad bad can be. We often see films which we describe as ""pretty awful"" or ""not much good"", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't ""good"" they are no way as stinkingly bad as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly clichéd, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall throw it in the bin."
Negative	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately I took film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say that I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.<br /><br />I have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film viewable. Otherwise, I would have written it off as another lousy film.<br /><br />I found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary, but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-out were pretty bad. There are some glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the low-caliber of the film.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie
Negative	This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman. One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him. As Cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are, who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal. Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. This is a way out film, and not very good at all.
Negative	There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video. Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video. This one is not an exception although the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (am Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. The film is also misstated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid one at that. This was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to erase this from their resumes. So if you are looking to see something naughty, but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter.
Negative	A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />If that sounds vague it's because the movie itself is. It's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. Also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). Still, I mostly hated this.<br /><br />The film meanders all over the place, is full of unlikable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the killer) moves at a snails pace. Three times I considered leaving the theatre because I was so utterly bored. But the director WAS there so I stayed. <br /><br />His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could like this more (there are VERY few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but I can't. Unless you're very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there's no reason to see this.
Negative	"This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such stinkers like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. The acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor I've ever seen. The best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What were they thinking? Who's the killer? A disgruntled ""Huggies"" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall zero, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it"
Negative	"I understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good. The show is horrible. I understand it, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. It's not funny, NOT funny! I don't want people to say ""Only smart people get it"" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying ""The sky is red"" but never looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the worst show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they're just horrible, her controversy is very lame, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really dumb and usually consist of really bad acting. I'm not sure what these ""smart"" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."
Negative	"This is not horror, as the first part was: This is (""campy"") light and humorous entertainment. Like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. But there's boobs, so I don't complain. And real boobs that is. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela ""Bruce's sister"" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, so I compare this to it. Again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly ""pathological"" ones. Especially the personnel of the camp. It's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some ""methods"" used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant. Actually this movie don't have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it in every way."
Negative	This movie isn't terrible, really. Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans snicker at. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do not care for Frenchmen; and the Xavier character isn't going to sway them.<br /><br />Let's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes:<br /><br />1). Cynical - very cynical. Check.<br /><br />2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:<br /><br />3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check.<br /><br />4). Lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks.) <br /><br />5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite that:<br /><br />6). Loose interpretation of the marriage vows. Check.<br /><br />7). Big sexual ego, which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check.<br /><br />Whether Mo is a hick or not, there's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so.<br /><br />On the other hand, as other male reviewers have, I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen's cute, petite body. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
Negative	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just doesn't work. I had a really hard time accepting this.Not that I don't think Tom can't act he can I've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole fails for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart out of the story and left us with nothing but the bare bones. There are things to like in this flick however the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score, But Tom as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan was completely flat."
Negative	"There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. There's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br />The ""film"" is total trash. Surreal bad trash. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind bad trash. There's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which aren't very hot or erotic. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.<br /><br />Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there with the equally wretched direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on."
Negative	"Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting horrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever ""zombie"" make-up was the worst I have seen. If you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying ""This movie sucks, don't waste your time, return NOW"" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie! i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, t should be in the negative"
Negative	"Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.<br /><br />When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />The film progresses from there, as Diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />The picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. <br /><br />This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the ""see it again and again"" category."
Negative	After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest...I just didn't like it. I had read so many good reviews on this movie, but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,<br /><br />I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, but the budget they had was the main problem, there was two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK) but they seemed like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - it's just impossible to hear what they're saying.<br /><br />It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape, but don't! <br /><br />Very frustrating...I only just scraped through this one!
Negative	"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, ""How did it get made,"" because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.<br /><br />No. The question is ""Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow it to be made?"" I think he needed the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. He knew the sequel was going to be so frightful, that out of pride, he wouldn't even count it's royalties as income. <br /><br />The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family.<br /><br />And ""dcreasy2001"" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently obvious that you worked on this film in some sad capacity, and the only way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's lone cheerleader as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at spin. Why not 10 stars?"
Negative	"is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. So in that respect, IMDb's average voting score is spot on.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of ""Falcon Crest"" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs involved are originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but as they were not allowed into the United States, plastic ones had to be made. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with Parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other US forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). The actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.<br /><br />As a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad."
Negative	"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears. The reason I'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on ""Of Mice and Men"" and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film ""Of Mice and Men"" and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal. I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. Did not like this movie at all."
Negative	"Ah, the infamous ""Guinea Pig"" series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series (""He Never Dies"",""Mermaid in a Manhole"", and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but ""Devil's Experiment"" just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to ""hideous"" (more often sometimes ""hilarious"") tortures. ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake ""snuff"" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making, but ""Devil's Experiment"" just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene..."
Negative	"This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. But for me, it failed. I won't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user ""reluctantpopstar"" gives a good description of it.<br /><br />But it didn't work for me. I found it slow, which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-in some films, one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. I don't think that this is the case here.<br /><br />As for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...I see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the ""action"". And I suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one."
Negative	"This subject matter deserves a much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together. The gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is just bizarre. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a ""missing poster"" from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short shrift that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation. Funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. In the end it seems to have joined in."
Negative	This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Well at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful bland CBC comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and could/should have led to a great show.
Negative	"This was an awful movie. Basically Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not at all Korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely insane. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in Korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie. Anyone who's ever been to Korea will know this is utter garbage. In the end the North Korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious ""paying for her sins"" way. Very bad film with a made-for-TV feel to it."
Negative	Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders' film,it may well be Kroko's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.
Negative	The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongggg.......not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also don't BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person, which is illigal. Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.
Negative	"I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so bad, I felt embarrassed for not only the ""actors"", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock.<br /><br />From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at LEAST some direction or dialog. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While watching this crap, I turned another TV on and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened.<br /><br />Needless to say, I kept watching Stern.<br /><br />Watching this ""film"" I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action. This makes ""KaZaam"" look like a Meryl Streep film.<br /><br />I'm sure Germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. Other countries need to take heed."
Negative	Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is, they don't exist--Ollie apparently made them up! So, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />This isn't a particularly unique story idea, as I've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME. It is much better than ONE TOO MANY--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick. Now I am not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. Sadly, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.<br /><br />Overall, not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself.
Negative	I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I still couldn't make it to the end credits. First time I managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest. Second time I managed to force myself to digest over an hours worth of shoddy acting, lame SFX and extremely poor direction. Pales in comparison to the original.<br /><br />Anyone ever hear about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who haven't let me fill you in. It's 1982...ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time...Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially painful story short the game flopped big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them.<br /><br />What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at the 3.2 rating and figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />Awful film...IMDb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as low as 0 let alone into the negatives.
Negative	Anyone who has seen 'Shine',Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that 'The SOLOIST' is very poor in comparison.It is as slow as a lullaby( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.Downey on the other hand; although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing both these well known so called 'STAR'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of 'shine's' Geoeffry Rush who's brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon.
Negative	"I think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, I walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. The so-called ""jokes"" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. I never want to have to see this **** film again, I'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. If anyone I see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face"
Negative	this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting. a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was. and the finale was awful. i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, but sadly i was mistaken.
Negative	Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast was below expectation. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag. But there is no fire.
Negative	If you have seen very less films, this might be a big one for you. If you have seen lot of films, this is a joke. The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are stupidily performed. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can predict whats going to happen next. You do not feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protray is terrible, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. It suppose to be a realistic movie, but it fails to show. There are times you wondering, you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them. Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid? There were only a few characters acting that was very good, but as far it is concerned with plot, action, it is poorly directed. This movie could have been short if they took out songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
Negative	"This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it sucked bad! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)<br /><br />The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can easily spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed, they didn't do a good job at it.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the actors... Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?<br /><br />Overall boring and laughable horror."
Negative	"The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.<br /><br />From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was just downright terrible. It seemed like a badly-acted children's movie which got confused, with a ""Wizard of Oz"" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.<br /><br />Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently couldn't be bothered. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least TRY and have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.<br /><br />Add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one ..."
Negative	"It was the tag-line ""in the tradition of American Pie"" that fooled me into renting this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass, with the major difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie seems like a Citizen Kane.<br /><br />This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10, because now I can't go beneath that. This one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats.<br /><br />I actually turned it off after 45 minutes, and that's something I very rarely do. But it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary.<br /><br />Can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop you on the head when you were just a child? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off? Something must be wrong, at least.<br /><br />My advice: stay clear of this one. Even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure."
Negative	"Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. Perhaps like that other ""innovator"", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />Yet Greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud on humor.<br /><br />Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones. They speak the lines with a bored, smug air like narcissistic adolescents.<br /><br />This film, despite its design and lighting, is meretricious."
Negative	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. The reasons why are many.<br /><br />The acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats OK. But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. Like the ending, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I got no closure what so ever... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...<br /><br />They should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this movie turned out bad...
Negative	David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated.
Negative	I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it. The acting was awful, and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes. The acting was awful at best. Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson, but I've no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking.<br /><br />The plot line was good, but the execution was just poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even worse though, which is this films only saving grace. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts. However, if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on something else, like a better film.
Negative	"Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was sophomoric at best.. Color me p***ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. That's saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. It's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. Crash and burn...."
Negative	May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, but for all its heralded realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant, even repellent characters, and asks the viewer to engage with them. Reid shines as May, and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters, that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold-hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was Kureishi trying to say. As directed, they are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness. <br /><br />Worth seeing for Reid's performance, but little else. A crying shame...
Negative	"Joe Don Baker. He was great in ""Walking Tall"" and had a good bit-part in ""Goldeneye"", but here in ""Final Justice"" all hope is gone...the dark side has won. <br /><br />As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely. It's obvious they were just beginning with ""Mitchell"" on their anti-Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme.<br /><br />It makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favorites - ""John Rhys-Davies for sale"", ""It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'"", ""none of them are sponge-worthy"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my favorite - ""'Son of a...'? What? What was he the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN?""<br /><br />By itself, ""Final Justice"" is, as Joe Don puts it in the movie, ""a big fat nada"". But here, it actually has some entertainment value. You get a chance, catch THIS version of ""Final Justice"".<br /><br />Two stars for ""Final Justice"". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY.<br /><br />Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town."
Negative	"Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was stilted and felt forced. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that: authors. Leave the acting to actors. Not that anyone in this movie was that great. I've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better."
Negative	"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences(such as the shootout in ""Little Germany""). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which I didn't agree of.<br /><br />1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The Dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Talibans 7. Again making fun of Bush.. WE GET IT HE'S AN IDIOT.. move on. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The Plot. 10. The killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast were just outrages and out there.<br /><br />Now the (few) good ones<br /><br />1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of Postal) 4. Uhm.. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few ""what the ef"" moments<br /><br />Boll did it again. He made another crappy game into movie adaption. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 2/10"
Negative	I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it fails miserably. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year-old on a Casio calculator, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice: Forget commercialism! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead!
Positive	"This is a great movie. In the same genre of the ""Memphis Belle"". Seen it about 10 years ago. And would like to see it again. There is a link with the history of the hells angels!!

Negative	Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood(without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad(piano and orgue... come on!). The acting is... well there is no acting!<br /><br />There's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.<br /><br />The killer is a fat, unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!<br /><br />Every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort.<br /><br />The end is so far the most stupid ever made. Think about it: The guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this flop) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them... On monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.<br /><br />The tragedy is that Mr.Hebert try to make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)<br /><br />So of course NO cops are gonna question him after his co-worker goes missing...<br /><br />WHATEVER.<br /><br />
Negative	Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video. MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned, this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit the Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all.
Negative	Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the CIA and pure bad-ass special operative. During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.<br /><br />Enter agent Collins, his supervising officer. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody. Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.<br /><br />The assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. So Dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.<br /><br />Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement...<br /><br />With a script like that need I say more? On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging. On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach.
Negative	"If you watched this movie you know why I said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"". Hehehe!!! Every time they said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus""... I laughed thinking ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie""? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake."
Negative	"...then they will have a proper place to file this crap. Sorry, not a ""mystery"" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. I kept waiting for the ""unimaginable evil"" that was promised me, but the ""evil"" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting tricked, as I was, into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror/supernatural film."
Negative	Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. This show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The voice acting could've been better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. Then there's the humor, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. And finally, last and least, the music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn the TV off. If you've never watched this show then don't. Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
Negative	Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did not like this one at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they crappy, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things. If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre...I mean there is a snake in one of them people. So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all, but rather turns me off.
Negative	I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's. And this one surely is an OOP. One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny. The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. In most editions it's cut out, why, I don't know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no T&A so nothing to offend people. But the movie is slow, extremely slow. It doesn't happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep. It's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.
Negative	I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.<br /><br />The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.<br /><br />Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.
Negative	These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason. That's all that happens and as you can see it's rubbish.
Negative	There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also uncalled for. Rsther than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.
Negative	"I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new ""Dukes"" movie is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)""You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is."" Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a DISGRACE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."" Was all the profanity, smoking, and drinking really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it has all gone to her head. She is in NO way a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but definitely no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve of the script. I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks."
Negative	"This movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />Movie history: The director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. He claimed he was making a movie called ""The brain that wouldn't die."" Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his ""so called movie."" That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and ""The Brain that wouldn't Die"" was born.<br /><br />I hate this movie! Plot Synopsis: The main character's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. At the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little to no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />Side notes: The end credit screen claims that the movie is called ""The Head that wouldn't Die"".<br /><br />I hate this movie!"
Negative	"Well how was I suppose to know this was ""the"" dumb ass promotional ""Lordi Motion Picture""? I mean, I realized this when that ""dinosaur"" costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming ""Hard Rock Hallelujah"" to myself... even though I hate that song. ""Dark Floors"" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... When they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... They run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... Nothing really memorable here, except the lousy acting, lack of gore/nudity, and the utterly shameless promotional edge, reminding me very much of ""KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park"". Yeah, remember that dud? Wish I didn't... I would just recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House films like a fungus and not listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band!"
Negative	"I am very sorry to say this but ""Thunderbirds"" does not even come up with a loud pop, never mind any thunder. At one stage I gave serious consideration to walking out of the cinema, I stayed in the forlorn hope that the film might improve. I was to be disappointed, it did not get any better, it got worse if that is at all possible. Had I gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a ""spoof"" I would still have been let down. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here, they have totally wasted that opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes well what can I say, he should be embarrassed and ashamed would not be to far from the truth. I saw this film at a pre-release showing, I had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say I was disappointed would be something of an understatement. One final thing I will say about the film was the puppets in the TV shows were just a bit more wooden than where the actors in the film."
Negative	For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play. <br /><br />-Let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors needed to pull it together. <br /><br />Romeo, Romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his lines with any gusto at all. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face, and absolutely NO grace with the lines that he was given. Whoever cast him deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. <br /><br />I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. I have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them. I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero.
Negative	The cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (Hardly.)<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film's real title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This movie is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. However, consider these points:<br /><br />There are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts, (One scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. From a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a drag queen! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />Shall I go into the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight.) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. No fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old Chuck Norris flick. There's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever LOW-speed chase put on film.
Negative	"This is quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen. Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie ""Malevolence"" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the WORST. The story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. I have seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than ""Troll 2"". Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but even than your stuck with it unless you throw it out which is what I am about to do!!!!"
Negative	My kid makes better videos than this! I feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video. It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. If you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end.
Positive	As a knowledgeable fan I recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted. As an 11 year old living in Istanbul I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought hmmmm, if girls like them, they must be crap. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was floored by the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother I was hooked for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis) I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine). >
Negative	"This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting. <br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time. Just plain torture.<br /><br />I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.<br /><br />You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's ONLY holes - and the excitement factor? Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.<br /><br />My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK'd this drivel, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: ""Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are idiots!""<br /><br />I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse. This is not a good sign, folks. <br /><br />Hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.<br /><br />I should be ashamed for watching it.<br /><br />I am ashamed. I'm off for a long shower."
Negative	The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely uneven, and includes many annoying elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. If done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience; much of the film had an odd feel to it. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were not coherent, and ending up being confusing. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end. I would advise you to not waste your time on The '60s and do something else with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class, and not on my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and stay away from this.
Negative	Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious.<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???
Negative	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.
Negative	You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once was enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?
Negative	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a ""dancing stand in"" in several of her pictures"". But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10"
Negative	The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all. Though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun. To disturb the boredom director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow evaporates and that's it. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I cannot recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was yawning all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.
Negative	"Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again.<br /><br />The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little ""spin"" to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - Borat was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves.<br /><br />1 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can."
Negative	So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />However, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. The screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. The acting is overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way.
Negative	This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a £4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn't exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh....... AVOID AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.<br /><br />This was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! <br /><br />Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.
Negative	The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *MIGHT* enjoy this film.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the *GENERAL* audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your own peril. At least I know I have been scarred for life :(
Negative	"I really don't have anything new to add but I just felt like I had to comment on this sack. So here goes:<br /><br />Atrocious. I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really painful but it was next on the list... You can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is ""Hobgoblins"" but it just couldn't get out. Everything about this movie is 4th rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the ""action scenes"", the... ahhhh forget it. I can watch a piece of crap like ""The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z"" (aka ""Zaat"") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (I like it in fact- btw, it will be on TCM later this month- October, 2009) but ""Hobgoblins"" is a whole 'nother ballgame.<br /><br />The worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This torment will last for days. <br /><br />Good luck, won't you?"
Negative	"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, ""I love you more."" ""No, I love YOU more."" I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her ""southern girl charm"" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some acting lessons?"
Negative	"This film was terrible. I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse, but very few.<br /><br />From the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it, like a kid with too many toys. There was the endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />It is called ""16 years of alcohol"", but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but it really was a waste of time and I would have been better off not bothering."
Negative	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
Negative	"This cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. Instead Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in ""reefer madness"" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unsubtle link is made to the Iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder the British film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still reeling from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is his last."
Negative	"This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh-riot. Really! It's worse than ""Destroy All Monsters."" Be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the Shriners have been here), the obviously polyester Norfolk jacket on ""Allan Quatermain,"" David MaCallum's badly done stutter (which does draw attention away from his even worse acting), the incredibly bad process work on all the ""monsters,"" the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom (""Voyage into the Future with the class of '71""), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman ,and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes."
Negative	I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it.
Negative	Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is over-done, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old. The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting.Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone's downfalls I would recommend it.<br /><br />If your renting/buying it to laugh at it I'd give it an 8.5.
Negative	"The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is no Cabarnet and certainly no Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real-life story ""Julia"" from her book ""Pentimento"". As one of the most odious of a plethora of Western-based USSR apologists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their military superiority in Spain.<br /><br />As one reviewer correctly noted, this is not a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave an American-loathing communist. This film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the American Left then, just as now the full mooner Left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy America."
Negative	"THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films. It has a definite story, it has adequate acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music isn't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I don't know where all the 10's come from, as there's no way this film is that good --- even if you're the filmmaker's mother. <br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had no story, certainly no acting was allowed by the director, the photography was dreadful, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a mess. I rated Phoenix a ""1"" because the scale doesn't go any lower. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't ""Decoy 3 -- the Shootout"" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish ""10"" scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms."
Negative	"If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film--it's so...so...unreal. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This isn't necessarily a bad thing--just a very surprising thing.<br /><br />What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical. If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I was going to puke.<br /><br />The bottom line is that like American musicals, not every French musical is gold. This film is not another ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or ""Huit Femmes"" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity."
Negative	"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything Lynch has done. ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynch's later work ""The Grandmother"" is quite simply an immature work. It's tedious and looks like a student film. But it was the 70's...It's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. ""The Alpahabet"" is forgettable (No really! I can't remember this one at all!) ""The Amputee"" is pointless. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is just plain silly. ""Lumiere"" is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD."
Negative	"this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty bad. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :D. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I wasn't really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It ain't Shakespeare folks. Other than the plot, which is full of holes, and the poor dialogue, I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired. there were shots were they were trying to look ""cool"", but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy. they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad. but if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe ain't bad either, and either is the female lead. heck if i can remember her name though. bottom line, i wouldn't otherwise waste your time."
Negative	"Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this movie appalling. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: ""They are doing all this for a man!?"" <br /><br />I find these women have no intensity, no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look stupid more than admiring.<br /><br />Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main.<br /><br />Anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so American. Had a European done it with European orientals, they would have done a far better job.<br /><br />I have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All spelt out for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I could not say they were good actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is great, but really, I cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals.<br /><br />I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I am sure that would be amazing to see."
Negative	"I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM's ""Essentials"" series. The eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos. This beholder saw little of value in this one. I was puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive. I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance. Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malone's performance outshines the rest, although Jasper Hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, though, I would have to say that I'm just not much of a fan of melodrama. The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes."
Negative	Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting was the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for bad language in movies, but the F-Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F-Bomb in any movie EVER. The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. I'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a DVD.<br /><br />Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my warning.
Negative	"OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. That's it. That's the good stuff. The acting...fair. The plot...silly. The ""twist""... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for ""plagues"" and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It isn't to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the ""shooters' standing there with no protection? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? That would stop her. But not as dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch so little network TV. Rubbish."
Negative	"Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the ""phantom."" He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as ""hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat,"" etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, I have a hard time rooting for the ""little guy.""<br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It did here as this actually dragged for awhile. It could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long. That's usual for Tom and Jerry's. Usually, they are much faster-paced."
Negative	"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch ""Regis and KAthie Lee"" or ""The View."") My four year old found one scene funny, but told me the rest of it was ""too silly."" This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />To say this movie is bad is like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this ""film"" truly is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse. Bronson ""Balki"" Pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are awful. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they HAD to be way better than this. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with... this?<br /><br />Bottom line: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10"
Negative	"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the ""good ole boy"" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that ""gay culture"" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles. I appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without ""the scene."""
Negative	I can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that? I was a huge fan the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />Now, I can't even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening. So, it was no longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />It's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. Don't they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain.
Negative	OK..this movie could have been soooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.<br /><br />The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical. It tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
Negative	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's basically all the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across some sort of point, although whatever that point is doesn't come across very well. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.
Negative	Pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. It's hard to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />One murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. I never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who overacts the most, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />The movie is patched together pretty poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. A woman fires a gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for comical effect.
Negative	"A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the ""Costume Killer"" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a ""lighter"" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode). He's just simply fun to watch in this one. <br /><br />David Dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role."
Negative	This movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.
Negative	There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s. The movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that's been done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year-old. The plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand around exposing her cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intricate, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10  and that's probably overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage.
Negative	"The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.<br /><br />Rather, the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air. This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct WB and every show on UPN. It was beat by all the shows on Fox and of course by all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC.<br /><br />Now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a re-run. But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re-run! It boggles the mind why CW would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from UPN.<br /><br />Clearly something is going on behind the scenes. Favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.<br /><br />Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The ""Veronica Mars has potential"" line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.<br /><br />Maybe it's Joel Silver's influence and clout, but frankly, I am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.<br /><br />A great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for CW."
Negative	This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure filler, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. A two or two and a half stars out of five.-MDM
Negative	"I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, what the heck?! This movie is missing a lot of the songs from the musical for crying out loud! Who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />I really am a very huge fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst of a musical that he ever did! The movie looked more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the heck decided to cut all of Meg's songs out of the movie?! <br /><br />I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe were probably wondering: ""Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?"" Well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably mad at the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather blank movie.<br /><br />Song and acting wise Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that is missing a lot of the text.<br /><br />So in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one isn't it! <br /><br />3/10"
Negative	If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a horrible experience. Disney's going to ruin one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene. It's been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct to video(the entire concept should be banned). Everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even repeats practically all her old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard songs so bad from them before until now. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation somewhat decent. All of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be(or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Back on the negative, Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might vomit. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it's not as horrific as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's little consolation.
Negative	"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film I have ever seen next to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""... and I have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is just a crummy B movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the ""heroes"" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. <br /><br />This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. I wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. It was bad, but I still liked it, despite my one star rating."
Negative	Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some mediocre action scenes however, the rest of the film is flawed. Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many loopholes, and missing pieces of information which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks?. His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
Negative	"I really tried to like this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.<br /><br />In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.<br /><br />The production values are terrible; mainly the acting. Oh, you won't enjoy ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.<br /><br />Second, the plot is just non sense. How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? How could she believe him?! The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.<br /><br />Also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking ""wtf?"". <br /><br />Scenes like those you will find plenty. <br /><br />Avoid this movie. Please, avoid it; it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. It's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.<br /><br />Only Mrs. Kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it. But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back."
Negative	Please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty bad storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later.<br /><br />So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost...<br /><br />So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />In short, it's a typical horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case may have it, Creep.<br /><br />I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us, Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much.
Negative	"I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies below a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. ""Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you"" I say, quite bored with the cheap thrills.<br /><br />The plot, even though predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. ""This was good until the end.... Then it just got silly"", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. Woo. How original. How unrealistic. How dull.<br /><br />3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've had amazing films, but this one sunk."
Negative	Bad movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (the airport one for example), and a real unfunny time. (Charles Dance) is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and I heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! I'll never understand why or how ?! In one TV interview I've heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! <br /><br />One of the comments said (Hey...It's the 1980s !). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s ! <br /><br />There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! Anyhow the second reason is that I've found this movie's title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever!<br /><br />The bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
Negative	"The Thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic wasn't as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had far less to work with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by one-off jokes which don't really seem related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the ""jump off end of ship"" scene - it's not funny. Rather, you just think to yourself, ""Did I miss something in the original movie?"". There were too many of these type of baseless jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />By contrast, the send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go ""faster"" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be ""faster"" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb ""media"", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone won't work, this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end."
Negative	"Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like ""Madam X"" but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good."
Negative	I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.
Negative	While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I haven't seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered one of the worst, and so maybe it wasn't the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is pretty much the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality wasn't one of his strong points. There's not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene isn't worth waiting for. I certainly don't recommend it!
Negative	"When I had first heard of ""Solar Crisis"" then got a load of the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw it.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />And the effects, while good, are pretty underwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />Don't get me started about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone's guess. Makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in Hollywood....<br /><br />And as far as the end goes.... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's too little too late in an effort like this. If it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, maybe I would have heard of ""Solar Crisis"" sooner.<br /><br />Two stars. Mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /><br />I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing junk like this?"
Negative	"(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I'm a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American/""Norwegian"" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />So I'm posting my corrections out of my frustration: -The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. -""Da"" is Russian, not norwegian. -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. -I could NOT understand the so called ""norwegian"" in this movie.. Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the ""norwegian priests""<br /><br />The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well.. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all.. Lenge leve Norge ! ;p"
Negative	"Why every horror director wants to imitate ""The Exorcist"" is a complete riddle to me, as William Friedkin's ""classic"" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And yet here's another clean rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable... ""Exorcism"" is not only very unoriginal, it's also an insufferably boring film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that'll nearly put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very stupid, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an awful film, end of story. Other European ""The Excorcist"" rip-offs are ""The Antichrist"" and ""Beyond the Door"" and they suck as well!"
Negative	In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a film masterpiece.<br /><br />The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely well. Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is opposite for the film in question.
Negative	"My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and ""Office Space"". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an ""also recommended"" selection if you liked ""Office Space"".<br /><br />Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. ""Haiku Tunnel"" is similar to ""office Space"" in that they are both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. It didn't. We couldn't take it any more, and stopped the tape. Thank GOD it was a free rental. I'd have been p***ed if we'd actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we didn't see the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. I doubt it.<br /><br />Haiku Tunnel is so bad it's hard to believe it ever got produced. The movie is SO unfunny it's painful. Just mail the friggin letters already!!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are awful. We got as far as the ""printer doesn't work"" scene and had to stop. We couldn't take it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Office Space......don't waste your time with this turd. 0/10"
Negative	Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it.<br /><br />A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but No..... It contains two Dino's with a taste for Human Flesh... Then a Crack team, who might as well be called Delta Force get called in.<br /><br />OK, This ain't Jurassic Park, and Yes The Dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a Costume that's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly LESS terrifying,but come on guys this had about 1% of Jurassic Park's Budget and as such does what it can.<br /><br />Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....HELL NO!!! I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi Channel Production. (again Movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on IMDb)<br /><br />The acting is as expected in a B Movie although none of the actors take it that seriously, neither does the script<br /><br />All in All it's an enjoyable B Movie - Not for Film Snobs<br /><br />** out of *****
Negative	"You may say to yourself, ""Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an terrible choice to me, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off.""<br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is an awful Elvis. He's too short, too weak-voiced, too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how bad he would be. Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy-handed eye-liner and mascara and it's a big fat embarrassing mess.<br /><br />The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off, after a while you don't even think of him as Elvis anymore. You see him as some other crazed pop star instead. Then, on that level, the movie becomes watchable.<br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.<br /><br />There's nothing new to this story; we've heard it many times before. If you've looking for new info or insight, you won't find it. It's told as a love story - an unrequited one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs."
Negative	"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And that's being generous.<br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud, ""Where the hell did that come from?""<br /><br />I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me want to puke and then puke again. Then blow my brains out.<br /><br />Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Watching grass grow, perhaps, is a proper alternative."
Negative	I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again.<br /><br />I have seen action films, I have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.<br /><br />Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. <br /><br />Furthermore, the plot has no real twists at all, a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. <br /><br />I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.<br /><br />Go watch some other movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands better action movies.
Negative	Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. The movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.
Negative	"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ""the Night of Distaste"". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's trying to convince himself Intensive Care never happened."
Negative	"I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show.It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY ""Christmas""?), perhaps the greatest,most iconic Christmas-season film of all time.But that's another review.<br /><br />At the time,I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost ""pink and white"", so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color.<br /><br />The film is kinda creepy! I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's amusing in a ""retarted-elf"" sort of way. By the way,the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74.<br /><br />If you are expecting maybe ""the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas--read on...<br /><br />By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish)always makes them seem ""surreal"". This adds to the films inherent oddness. It is also pretty scary in that a ""mishevious demon"" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids ""evil"". One particularly nightmarish scene has a young ""latch-key"" boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the ""port-a-family"" emerges out of giant ""Christmas presents-of-the-mind"" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! See this,Christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're hallucinating...without drugs!"
Negative	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it. I lost. I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a movie.
Negative	Not that he'd care, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I was, there's a good chance we'd fallout if he continued to make dross like this. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's rude and obnoxious, and thinks he's funny when he frankly isn't. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally out of place with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he hires a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting an act of revenge for his boss. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, even though he's done nothing nice. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as shallow as his. It all makes for a predictable film conclusion, although I can't see any viewer expressing how this mirrored their life. The shame is that on paper this is a cast supposedly worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
Negative	"""Shinobi"" is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.<br /><br />OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb.<br /><br />Fine, fine! There is no character development, and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, NO! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, ""Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*."" THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film, I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it."
Negative	First of all, I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads imply. In my mere opinion, the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant.<br /><br />However, the acting is near perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is just a media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. And just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and o something real artistic, I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work. Hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach.<br /><br />In short; Pros > Good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Cons> Each and every single thing, other than the cast
Negative	"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I was left cold by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward ""Behind the Music"" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from ""Animal Farm."" The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only."
Negative	The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's house<br /><br />The film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep<br /><br />Direction by Priyan is very bad music(Pritam) is routine except the first song<br /><br />Cinematography is bad, the film has a cheap look throughout<br /><br />Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films But No, He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace, He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, But doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible
Negative	Ok first of all, this movie sucks. But lets examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing. But that's as far as they take this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibilty of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and trys to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then to make the movie worse, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again. Damn you Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negative	"William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the old retread of ""The Hook"", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.<br /><br />Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. A bit corny, but fun to watch except for maybe the sailor tale. The acting is understandably not award worthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann."
Negative	The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title, it's so utterly misleading. It's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie.<br /><br />The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.<br /><br />Very little happens in this film. And when something does wake the viewer from his stupor, it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists. These guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons. It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal. But the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's a travesty. Unintentionally funny at best, pathetic at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, uneven. The women characters are particularly idiotic; the men are either creepy or tedious.<br /><br />The whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience. It doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. All we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots.<br /><br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. It's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to anyone.
Negative	"After too many bad memories, I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this the worst ST:TNG episode (with the exception of ""Shades of Gray,"" which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's Writing 101 teacher: ""SHOW, DON'T TELL!"" From Deanna Troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from ""Doctor Who"") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(Zero points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here. Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode. Me, I'd rather skip ahead to ""Time Squared"" or ""Q Who."""
Negative	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for some it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're wrong. It's overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i still don't like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
Negative	I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary got. Now, I respect the guy's opinion and faith, I myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />This film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I'm not recommending against seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also misrepresents the Christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way in which this whole think is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and dreadfully biased.
Negative	Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time. Granted, it could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.
Negative	"A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />Not a great flick, it's really typically a ""B"" action flick. Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of ""blah"" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average ""B"" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's okay. It doesn't suck too bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what Russia looks like today!"
Negative	I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I wasn't impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasn't very good either, I can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany Cox
Negative	"Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approach to life doesn't work out very well.<br /><br />Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is an opportunity missed. The story line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family 'plot' lurches from one predictable event [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material. The ""3 for 1"" casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian ""History Channel"" material. It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex.<br /><br />"
Negative	Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis. However, I can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic navel-gazing, trite humor, or banal subject matter would be particularly engaging to anyone over 30. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but contempt for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /><br />However, one has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to spruce up an otherwise non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, beware of festival darlings. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment. But these young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. Yet I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point.
Negative	"I personally liked ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, ""The Prophecy II"" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. The character of Valerie was annoying enough, and Danayel annoyed me even more. The biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. Still, Walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""Prophecy"" films. ""The Prophecy II"" is nevertheless the weakest of the three ""Prophecy"" films with Walken. Definitely a Christopher Walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that."
Negative	I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. And my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. HE was a great man. But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching, that I found it insulting.<br /><br />First of all, they didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability. Sure they were competent actors, but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film. Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful. What? They couldn't find an actual amputee anywhere for the film? For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee? At that point in the film I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that I came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I am.<br /><br />Figure that out.
Negative	"My dear Lord,what a movie! Let's talk about the ""special effects"" first. Don't get me wrong here, I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past, mainly the 60's. So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...<br /><br />What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. However, in a movies like this bad acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.<br /><br />My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />There could be one single reason to watch this one though. If you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.<br /><br />By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like ""Critical Mass"" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree."
Negative	"""Back of Beyond"" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. Even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing, but are in the mood, at least, for something a little different than the usual."
Negative	"Black Candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us ""Vampyres"" and much later, ""Rest in Pieces"", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it, and the man keels over. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be devil worship. It's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times. To spice things up though, there's a simulated bestiality scene (I HOPE it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh. At times this echoes ""Rosemary's Baby"", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon. However, the herbs aren't the only thing that reeks about this film. The end seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they've been during the middle part. It's not unwatchable, it's just not very good, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there wasn't much here that did anything much for me. 3 out of 10."
Negative	"Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie ""Our Gang"" release schedule, ""A Tough Winter"" features two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!<br /><br />The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.<br /><br />""A Tough Winter,"" to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. ""Our Gang"" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a ""skilled comic"" and used this ""Our Gang"" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved.<br /><br />Although there are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, ""A Tough Winter"" is a plodding and meandering effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 ""Our Gang"" films.<br /><br />3 out of 10."
Negative	I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some porno movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />Subtle, this ain't. With some of the most obscene and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review removed! However, despite the utter crappiness of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the crude names and odd subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. <br /><br />By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It may not be the absolute worst thing I have ever seen, but it probably is the weirdest and possibly the most offensive!
Negative	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I should have known better.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone. It holds absolutely NONE of the originals super charm! It seems, to me, quite rough, and almost brutal, right from the (don't)Sing-a-longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was laid over the top, and didn't seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. It's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly didn't fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 isn't up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which doesn't feel right.<br /><br />The movie itself could have been it's own story, I think that it should have been just that. I wouldn't say that I hate it, but I believe that it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.
Negative	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the witless ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, alas, wasted. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story to surround it, and there's none in sight.<br /><br />The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the most disgusting of the three, and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily after all. But alas, this movie heads straight for the toilet, with no redemption, no happy ending, no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />Before ""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,"" I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Unfortunately, I hadn't seen the half of it.<br /><br />"
Negative	"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult-crap! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Masssacre"" fails miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned ""Cat in the Brain"". That one features ALL the great moments of ""Massacre"", and then some."
Negative	When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.
Negative	Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, but the whole screenplay is a joke. It is just as cheap as the entire production. The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely hilarious. Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules, specifically cop Thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks. An enjoyable piece if you have the time, but do not expect anything more.
Negative	MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Amateurish. This film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. The story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually aCt....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. The only thumbs up(get it...finger....LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride) after making this terrible movie. Do not judge this by the poster....you'll be very let down.
Negative	"I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. <br /><br />The film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continuing with blah blah blah; yet another killing (surprising, huh?); blah blah blah, etc...<br /><br />The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid ""big"" red-herring used throughout the movie wouldn't convince a 5 year old. And I figured out the secret identity of the incubus the moment I saw the character, so when the ""shocking"" surprise ending arrived, I wasn't shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on chuckling days after I saw the movie. It's so silly!<br /><br />Anyway, the film is so by-the-number that the ""rock band"" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this dreary flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his obviously fake long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I actually liked. But aside from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, except that it's unintentionally hilarious."
Negative	Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was too technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic. The acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken too seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it's first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
Negative	"OK, I have watched the original French version. But I can't imagine this being better with subtitles.<br /><br />All I have to say that this is the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this film. That's why I can't understand all the positive reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.<br /><br />I usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters. None of which I could identify with or care for. In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking: ""When are they going to shut up""? The acting was pretty bad. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. But It seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given. Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. Going from one scene to the next. It seems this movie was just written (badly) but never directed.<br /><br />This is one of the few films that I can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes. No suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what so ever.<br /><br />A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie."
Negative	"As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting wasn't the best. That's forgivable. It's the message that's not: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. I laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. THEN you'll win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because ""God wanted him to make it."" Then you'll win the state championship again the next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.<br /><br />Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. Which bible is this story based on? I'll bet Saint Stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble."
Negative	I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn't explain the story very well, and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like I said, it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but came off as whiny and overdramatic.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I just pictured something so completely different.
Negative	"With a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse ""shock"" tactics... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a ""grabby"" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave"" was intended as an unofficial sequel to ""I Spit on Your Grave"" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! This movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably..."
Negative	This film was a big disappointment.<br /><br />I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy (good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted!) Davis' one-note performance oozes petulance, but none of the nuances of Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems out-of-sync with his costar, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy.<br /><br />Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capably handled very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old west relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is quite irritating. His character's constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony. <br /><br />I really love every one of these performers, and it is a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
Negative	First thing I noticed in this movie of course, was the unnecessary amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything, but a lot that was not needed. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching for.<br /><br />Instead we know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes little skill to play. She has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light. The idea is great, but hideously executed throughout the film. 3/10
Negative	A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. This movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong.
Negative	"Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There's Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.<br /><br />In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. Having said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could have played off each other much, much more. Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, but Stiller is no Ross. It is more of a ""Joey with a crush on Rachael"" scenario.<br /><br />Polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its failing - it lacks heart. You don't root for the characters. With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see it."
Negative	After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Though i guess not. If the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. Though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.
Negative	"When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth ""several thousand million years ago."" In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call ""Radium X"" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in Africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it didn't captivate me. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 4/10"
Negative	Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.
Negative	"...This would be the worst film i'd ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Awful, truly awful.<br /><br />I had low expectations and it failed to meet them! I honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...<br /><br />1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />There are so many unanswered questions, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask ""What the F*** do you want us to do?! He's a F***ing alien! We don't know jack about his anatomy!""? <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, Why? Just, Why? <br /><br />BTW, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake."
Negative	"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talents in the film The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the grainy, poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. He's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned, so that he can keep this off his resume. Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher but he and Seller both look pretty desperate, with even Sellers' makeup and hair looking quite terrible. They had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible unease:<br /><br />PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that's one of the GOOD jokes. It's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults, but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well-received British TV program ""A Show Called Fred"" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?"
Negative	This engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks good, but huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.
Negative	"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" It was slightly amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have WAY TOO MUCH ""playing around"" time.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. But seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. She is very unprofessional. She keeps on interrupting Steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. It's just really become annoying to the point that I can't watch it anymore.<br /><br />Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. She's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about her.<br /><br />Also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. They're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...<br /><br />I believe ""Good Day LA"" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually CARE about the news.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: (I'd really rather watch KTLA. However, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. They're still a bit dull though. Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's ""Today."" ABC's ""Good Morning America"" is also okay... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)"
Negative	"A bunch of women who can't act sit around, talk, smoke pot. They have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store-bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers. We don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet. I can't eat Spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this. Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is ""hunting"" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of some ""superhuman"" guy freaking out. He p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.<br /><br />There is no action, no special effects, no story. If you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you get to see them move some stuff, including the deformed sister, when they move to their new apartment. Its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed."
Negative	"A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the ""set."" Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rips half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of film-world name-dropping a la ""Scream"" (except it's Aussie name-dropping--Jane Campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of ""is this real or is this a movie"" a la ""New Nightmare."" The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: ""Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!"" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. ""You got any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?"" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and ""Where the hell is my agent?"" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her.)"
Negative	"I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday ""private"" occurrences. Unfortunately, the film falls under the 'The Brown Bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. Neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'The Brown Bunny.' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. It has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this."
Negative	"I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.The acting was not much more above the lower production values however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit ""Dead Like Me"" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.I felt as though if anyone might ""make it"" from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'Godfather' or perhaps 'Beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low-budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying ""It's a start!"""
Negative	"Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this ""Phantom"" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting ""better guns"". Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the ""professionals"".<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is pretty bad too. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap. It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what paintball is. To be honest real paintball isn't all buddy like, it's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not ""respect"" and playing by the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming ""4 is 1!!"""
Negative	I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.<br /><br />Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so had they not revealed this in the preview, it might have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not.<br /><br />In fact, there's not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you saw even one preview, you saw the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save yourself $3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire film, other than how terrible the soundtrack is.<br /><br />I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had less talent and musical ability.<br /><br />The acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities.
Negative	I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me. <br /><br />But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /><br />Otherwise - don't see it! I only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie.<br /><br />Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!<br /><br />Or maybe you like this film because of it's place in Dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Cause as movie it isn't that appealing, it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating. <br /><br />And furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it. The scenery looks like cheap Theatre. And i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies. Cause i can love old film as well as new.
Negative	"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. But then again, when I first saw ""House on Haunted Hill"" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. But there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! That at least made me jump out of my seat!"
Negative	You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something I thought was reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism.
Negative	"I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I declined to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""I'll be Back"" and ""Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn"". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as ""Notting Hill"" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........"
Negative	I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can't look elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
Negative	"This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic ""NEW-COMER"" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the Militia-men that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It's more of character study, and a come to Jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in ""RAWANDA"". This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time."
Negative	"It was Jon Pertwee who said "" It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly "" . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is "" Very easy "" . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there`s not enough of a film to ruin .<br /><br />PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy"
Negative	Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies. This movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. But they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the store. Did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend NOT to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.
Negative	"Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly good, this one is just pure crap. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I didn't like it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are overacting, and how much the special-FX sucked even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. I don't know about you, but I didn't give a rats ass about any of that at all, and its basically filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very cliché alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. You never feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />There is really nothing memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a quick way to make some money though. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I ""just don't get it"" anyway, or something along that line. I really don't care though; this was crap back then and it still crap now."
Negative	Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad.
Negative	This movie was bad. This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The setting was unrealistic. The story was absurd: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats ridiculous. How can radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?<br /><br />Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup would not have even looked frightening to a newborn child. The Insane Clown Posse scare me more...and they're supposed to look stupid.<br /><br />Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. How can steel block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?<br /><br />Equally insulting is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves no purpose in the film and makes you want to shoot your television.<br /><br />The stupidest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally unrealistic. Who would go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is unsophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem intelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a bag of Cheetos. Don't see this movie, ever.
Negative	I would give this movie 5 rather than 3 if it would be at least in time... When i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say idiotic habits of our (Kazakhstan) government... It's a shame, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. The movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Mr Aimanov's death the production of quality movies went down almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. However, in late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/Russian rock legend, - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... And again back to our 'nomads'. Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe British. Nobdy liked it, even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'KVN'. IMHO
Positive	I don't know why I like this movie so well, but I never get tired of watching it.
Positive	I think it's one of the greatest movies which are ever made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still a very good movie!
Positive	This film made John Glover a star. Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film. And I mean that sport.
Positive	It is an almost ideal romantic anime! MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES! But the English dubbed version is not too good. Perhaps the 1999 version will be better.
Positive	This is a 'sleeper'. It defines Nicholas Cage. The plot is intricate and totally absorbing. The ending will blow you away.<br /><br />See it whenever you have the opportunity.
Positive	The one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an incredible future vision, this movie establishes a new standard of s/f movies. hail and kill!
Positive	The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty good replacement duo.
Positive	Liked Stanley & Iris very much. Acting was very good. Story had a unique and interesting arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was refreshing. Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings. Very enjoyable movie.
Positive	A very engaging, intelligent, and well-made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles superbly. The cinematography is outstanding. The fight scenes are amazing. This is a film I will enjoy watching again and again. One of my favorites.
Positive	This is the best movie I've seen since White and the best romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. An emotive, beautiful masterwork from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a tragedy this movie hasn't gotten more recognition.
Positive	"I thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable. The acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
Positive	The blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a true work of art. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is moving. The length of the work makes it easily accessible for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Positive	I had really only been exposed to Olivier's dramatic performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy Merle Oberon, and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm.
Positive	This movie had me smiling from beginning to end, partly at the humor, partly at Meg Ryan (this is the perfect character for her), and always because it's just one of the best feel-good movies I've seen. Hopefully the DVD will be out soon.
Positive	Omar Epps is an outstanding actor. I really think he gets into his character alot. When deja gets shot he shows true emotion. He also shows true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is a very talented actor!!
Positive	if you like gangster type of movies, then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent, Al Pacino his performance is top notch. and the story is classic!! 10 / 10 !!!! Why isn't this movie in the TOP 250 list??
Positive	"Yes, I'm sentimental & schmaltzy!! But this movie (and it's theme song) remain one of my all time greats!! Robert Downey Jr. does such justice to the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is romantic & makes one believe in happy endings!!"
Positive	"""Fear of a Black Hat"" is a superbly crafted film. I was laughing almost continuously from start to finish. If you have the means, I highly recommend viewing this movie It is, by far, the funniest movie I have had the pleasure to experience. Grab your stuff!"
Positive	Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie.There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie.One of the greatest actors in the world wasted,and for what reason, none what so ever,so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DON'T WASTE THEM
Positive	i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really strong. might make you feel different.
Positive	I thought this was one of those really great films to see with a bunch of close friends. I laughed and cried and laughed and cried at the same time. It was just really touching. Although not a new concept this was a very well made film.
Positive	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is a classic if you are seeing it for the first time. Creative dialog, unique genius in the final scene, it deserves more credit than critics have given it. Highly recommended, one of the best comedies of recent years
Positive	Awful dreams, wild premonitions, blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven's (arguable) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them. Filled with blood and occasional gore, The Fourth Man is truly neurosis inducing. Men will literally leap when Renee swings out her scissors......
Positive	The arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. Both are extremely likable and attractive.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a dream -- with the exception of Sig Ruman's annoying faux Russian.
Positive	I enjoyed this movie very much. Kristy Swanson Omar epps, and Ice Cube were all great in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I didn't know if I was going to like it, but Singelton did a terrific job of creating characters that you really cared about.
Positive	I would never have thought I would almost cry viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Thanks to Martin Scorsese I did (the movie was from F. Borzage). You will start to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a good movie.
Positive	Great battle finale and nice sets help keep this often-slow movie enjoyable. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were enough memorable moments to make the film stand out in my mind days after watching it. The ending should surprise even those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Positive	I couldn't agree more with the other comment, it's like Falling down. Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt great as always, except in Lost in Space. This is a good movie. With pretty good performances. Very recommendable. If you like Falling down you're going to enjoy this one. 8 of 10
Positive	Maybe one of the most entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A hard-hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion (eehaaa!). Made in ´83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!
Positive	"For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually funny! Maureen Stapleton is a scene stealer. The Moroni character is an absolute scream. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt."
Positive	Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply fantastic! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was top-notch! It was easy to understand how this special received awards.<br /><br />Not muddled down by guest appearances, the focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production.
Positive	Tom and Butch Cat fight over the capture of Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry gets kicked out. The two cats dress in their master's clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it! Confused, Tom and Butch whack their master's rear and all three of them get kicked out.
Positive	Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. Hope it gets the distribution it deserves.
Positive	Good show, very entertaining. Good marshal arts acting. Good story plot. The entire main crew did a nice job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a BIG hand to Judson Mills. An especially fine tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. A GREAT ! actor who will be truly missed.
Positive	So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments.The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey.It is journey worth experiencing. Don't miss it! It is available on home video.
Positive	Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value. Michael Curtiz at his best. Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best. A forerunner to the Thin Man series. Recommend to everyone. Did you figure it all out?
Positive	"This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X, and so seen as a pornographic movie. Here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females ""own satisfaction"" need.<br /><br />A very good film!"
Positive	This is probably my favorite movie of all time. It is perfection in its storytelling. It will break your heart not because it's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through. You feel for Doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.
Positive	Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character. This film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness. It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities.
Positive	I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes... this is definitely really about a 5.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of bloody, had likeable, shallow characters, and it had some really hot babes in it. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime... that sometimes gets old.
Positive	I have to tell you, this is a great movie. It surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be. This one is just fabulous. It could be that it isn't TRYING too hard to send any kind of message; it just tells a whimsical, fun story. I gave it a 10 out of 10.
Positive	Nobody said movies had to be realistic did they? I really liked this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Positive	"Superb cast, more please!<br /><br />If you can catch just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these wonderful actors). For anyone who doesn't know Plater has a real feeling for jazz, my recommendation is to see the 'Beiderbecke' trilogy whenever you can.<br /><br />""There's three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the tune start?'"""
Positive	A very well made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
Positive	"I gave it an 8 star rating. The story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout.""Men of Honor"" was changed from ""Navy Diver"" understandably so. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that ""Honor"" is an appropriate word to use in the title."
Positive	Marlene Gorris has established herself as one of the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually beautiful film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and captures well that writer's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I consider to be his finest performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is brilliant as well. Well worth seeing.
Positive	Holes is a wonderful film to see. It has good messages in in, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone. I still say the book is better than the movie, but the movie gives the book a run for its money. Also, Khleo Thomas plays Zero. That really adds to it!!!! Lol!!!
Positive	Obviously, there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production. But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot. I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other (great) Chinese films. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything...
Positive	This is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home. Or so it seems. Cleverly, the film, based on the play, portrays the complexities of family life. The supporting cast is terrific as well, with many familiar faces lending support.
Positive	This movie is one of my all time favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up into one. The final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears. If you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend it.
Positive	I saw this film without to know what about were... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare' films, and, in the beginning, I saw it only for this... and I finished with tears in my eyes, because the great, great serenity, values, affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena's girl. Recommended to people who are bored with TV programming (in Spain, at least).
Positive	The Color Purple is a masterpiece. It displays the amazing acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this. It's a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time!
Positive	An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
Positive	This is the touching story of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.
Positive	Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening. THE FILM IS GREAT!!! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is right on the money. See it opening weekend. You won't be disappointed.
Positive	One of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Great storyline with a romantic, horrific, and ironic plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character! Not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series. Don't miss out on the best of the series.
Positive	The best martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu.It's a great pity that whilst Bruce Lee had been so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules!!!!
Positive	It is not the same as the other films about dancing. A few normal people found themselves from dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people. They are someone that you may see everyday in your offices. They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This touches me very deeply.
Positive	This is not a bad film. It is not wildly funny, but it is interesting and<br /><br />entertaining. It has a few funny moments. Cher gives a good<br /><br />performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self. Her<br /><br />performance alone is worth the watch. If this movie had come out<br /><br />today it would not have been nominated, but by '80s standards it<br /><br />was excellent.
Positive	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting, dark comedy. Shot on a shoestring budget, yet had the flavor of the early Coen brother's film Blood Simple ... and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot! Needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor.
Positive	It's been quite some time since I've watched this LOTR. I am currently hunting for a copy to purchase. Bakshi's work is quite true to the original work. The visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting.<br /><br />Drawbacks? Occasionally, the movie is confusing or muddled. There are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl. But, overall -- buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
Positive	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting. This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score, which really irked me throughout the entire movie. If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes. Then the film would be much, much better.
Positive	It is a story of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about passion and feelings, about Russian soul, and very romantic. This movie IS NOT action packed, it flowes slowely. In second part one can find great songs - Russian romances. It is much more better than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example.
Positive	"Above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's more accurate than not. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving. Chris Cooper turns in a first-class performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy."
Positive	"This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why. Even 45 years later, it is quite an impressive piece of work. Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Good use of live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Most recommended."
Positive	This film is outstanding and wonderfully scored. Prince's Oscar for music was richly deserved (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A great surprise: Prince does a fine job acting, and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are good in their supporting roles. Very cool landmark film.
Positive	i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was well written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
Positive	I thought this move was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall, I was quite surprised. The courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic, but was real enough to be entertaining. I found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it. Being a military pilot I could relate to many of these parts.
Positive	This Film was really eye-opening. I have seen this film several times. First, when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him.<br /><br />A great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!
Positive	"This movie was hysterical. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. I mean, it's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but was it supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is hot and awesome. The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as I did."
Positive	"If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role. The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great, and song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is perfect. You have to watch it."
Positive	"I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and snapped it up eagerly. While the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I am still entranced by one segment:<br /><br />Stanley and Stella in ""Breaking the Ice"". The music is brilliant, and the emotions feel real. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately."
Positive	There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise. Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its best.
Positive	"An excellent movie. Superb acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and unlike the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, this movie actually had a plot, and was very well done. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R&B charts at the time."
Positive	Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this endearing film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother. Amazingly, he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can control. An amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by Daniel Day Lewis. 9 of 10
Positive	This movie i have been dying to see. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It was completely worth it. This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is funny no matter which movie he is in. However, this should come real close to being his greatest. If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one u can't pass over.
Positive	"Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting. The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""God"") is great and makes the film worth catching. GRADE: B"
Positive	The One and only was a great film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Sad, funny, and all around GREAT!!! **** 10+
Positive	Tis is a farly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in appropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Highly recommended.
Positive	Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well hold true in France; at any rate, it's quite romantic.
Positive	jim carrey can do anything. i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie, and it TOTALLY was not. it was so incredibly funny for EVERYONE, adults & kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm way to excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven't already, it was so great!<br /><br />Liz
Positive	"""A little nonsense now and then, is cherished by the wisest men.""<br /><br />If you are too smart to watch this movie, then you are too smart to be alive. <br /><br />Wonderful romp, wonderful premise, period piece done with acute eye for detail.<br /><br />Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just wonderful!<br /><br />Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /><br />Then, thank me."
Positive	"Despite having 6 different directors, this fantasy hangs together remarkably well.<br /><br />It was filmed in England (nowhere near Morocco) in studios and on a few beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was moved to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". It remains a favourite of many people."
Positive	This is an excellent documentary, packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story. The IMAX Cameras give you a very wide perspective, as a DVD movie it is perfect. Your hear every speaker working almost all the time, The film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph. Of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good, they give a depth to the driving scenes...
Positive	This is a lovely, spirit-restoring movie. From the use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
Positive	"Rating ""10/10"" Master piece<br /><br />Some years ago, i heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr Spielberg, i guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - together with schindler's List - is your best. Even Oprah acts well in this one !<br /><br />What got me most is the realism of the story and drama. Stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world."
Positive	I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is a little strange sometimes but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility. The action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to US movies. This may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for Sweden and I hope to see more similar ones in the future.
Positive	"Well , I come from Bulgaria where it 's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be ""very , very afraid""!!!This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie!I don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child (WELL DONE)!Now about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic but frightens you!If you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is the movie!"
Positive	Boris and Bela do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children,I took note of 2 things: It held the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I caught a few things I hadn't when I first watched it.Very swift story with an unpredictable end. A must for movie buffs!!!
Positive	A wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another. Beautifully shot and acted, although David Niven doesn't seem to be 27 years old, as his character claims to be. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This film made me think, while I was watching it, and afterwards.
Positive	"As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous. The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no ""men"" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy becomes a man really fast (we should all be so lucky at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love."
Positive	This is a great movie that I don't think gets enough credit as Saturday Night Fever or Grease in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood. Even though it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is terrific. 10/10
Positive	"A longtime fan of Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the ""Bette of Roses"" album. Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around."
Positive	"Just like wine, ""Johnny Dangerously"" gets better and better with every day. This clever, witty, well-acted film could very well stand on its own - but as a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly outstanding. In fact, it's quite obviously the best film of its kind... the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period - although, admittedly, this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive, vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as ""Jane Austen's Mafia""."
Positive	OK, this movie was cool. I don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. Enjoyable all the way until the end, but a great concept. This is a movie that one has to just forget criticism all together and just enjoy. Judgment is victory for Robot Jox.
Positive	This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (happy tears!)
Positive	I just can't believe that these games can get so much better, but they do. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but even though I did beat it I can't wait to buy it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I must own all of them even if I have beaten them many times over. I hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end.<br /><br />
Positive	An excellent film with great performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to their displeasure (& mine) Garibaldi arrived on station. (All due respect to Jerry Doyle but in Seasons 4 & 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It doesn't take him long to start criticizing Zack (who I love best of all on the show)and taking charge. I'm sure Zack could have coped. The Soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven as Zack does. The humour supplements it nicely. 10/10
Positive	Call me adolescent but I really do think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely watch this one. Perhaps more compelling than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, yet strangely familiar...The music is catchy too. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments make the wait worthwhile.
Positive	Richard Linklater's beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's best thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decade's most engaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic, intellectual, and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing, touching and insightful moments.
Positive	A pleasant surprise! I expected a further downgrade along the line: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped film. Perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners, decent background/motivation instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it. Fanboys expecting an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for the more intelligent action fans. It didn't even bother me Jolie appeared so little.
Positive	An unconventional historical drama, with some fine battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good back-up. The script is literate and pretty original, and the film is kept mercifully free of heroes. That said, it does drag a bit, and the last reel is too much like a TV mini-series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Worth seeing.
Positive	"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but Granger plays his part perfectly. However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly made, with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given. The direction is taut and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is, to my way of thinking a major film, unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti."
Positive	One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds. Nearly 40 years old, I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not laughed & enjoyed a movie so much in a long time.<br /><br />Take time out and watch this with the kids. It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were a young one.
Positive	"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a once-off great performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (but unseen to others) alterego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent ""screwballs"" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar.<br /><br />Definitely worth renting out if you can find it. (Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK)"
Positive	I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I didn't when finally in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, my hair stood on its ends. There is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples.
Negative	And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill-advised. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS CUT OUT AND COVERED UP!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they don't do it very well, that's for sure. Anyway, instead of the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever!
Positive	Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
Positive	"One of the best love stories I have ever seen. It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion, but lovely nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly, and are infinitely quotable: ""It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?"" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever, and so will Big Edie ""The World Famous Singer"" and Little Edie "" The World Famous Dancer."""
Positive	This movie is plain fun.I has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is fun to watch.<br /><br />Another try, but better than Band camp and The naked mile, at least funnier.<br /><br />Just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out, so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together.We had a few beers and we had fun.<br /><br />You will not find any deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching.<br /><br />So, lay back and just enjoy.
Positive	"A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting, even though they are marrying other people. Maybe a little trite in that the ""partners"" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Not anything heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - sell them the sappy romance, everyone wins!"
Positive	Sweet romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's beautifully acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dream-like. A one of a kind film. Don't miss it!
Positive	"While there aren't any talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, or villians with half white / half black hair ... it does have 1 thing ... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and Walt & Roy did in their eras with the studio. If you thought think ""The Castaways"" or ""The Island At The Top Of The World"" weren't identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon."
Negative	"THE JIST: See something else.<br /><br />This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I can't figure out why. The film is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy ""noir"" feel. But it just isn't entertaining. It also doesn't make a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations. I don't know anyone that behaves like these characters do.<br /><br />This is a difficult movie to take on -- I suggest you don't accept the challenge."
Positive	This is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film!!! Full of tender moments and memories!! A beautiful piece of work!!! Excellent!!! For intelligent, viewers only!!!<br /><br />If you are a film lover. A romantic. A person who has loved deeply, this is your film!!!!<br /><br />It has a beautiful surreal quality. Fine acting and directing. Watching this film made me remember my first love.<br /><br />Thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaning of loss.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all film lovers.
Positive	Now, many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately. This movie is chock full of wonderful gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience! If you're a lover of good quality experiences, then by all means, watch this great flick!
Positive	As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be an excellent picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, see this movie it will not disappoint.
Positive	"Not only was this movie better than all the final season of H:LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Looking at the ""Top 250"" I see that only one small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to increase that group to 2.<br /><br />I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!"
Positive	"An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. I loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, I would watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. I was very impressed by the look of the film, too. Usually, ""independent films"" have a grainy, I-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...quality work. I'm looking forward to a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"
Positive	It was released in France on dvd several years ago--I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles. Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king. He sets off to join the army and goes to war. His love, however, is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. I won't spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a great loss to moviedom.
Positive	"This is what I call a growth movie. Every character is different and better at the end- and it's all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love"". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men. The book stayed very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine."
Positive	The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it better than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a great face that man has!<br /><br />The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's luminous performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it.
Positive	Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn't think I would like it, but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her romance with the older Tassi envoked recognisable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, I loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama's. Great play, great camerashots, great music and texts. I loved it and I want more of it! :-)
Positive	Yowsa! If you REALLY want some ACTION, check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like! Want action? You'll get more of it here than in PEARL HARBOR. Want babes? You'll get an eyeful every two minutes. Want more? Go out and BUY THIS VIDEO! Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa! That's some mighty spicy meatballs!!!
Positive	Not wishing to give *anything* away here, I would just say this technically excellent, flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half's entertainment: It will amuse, surprise, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time, as it approaches the inevitable, but not obvious, ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way. Most definitely recommended.<br /><br />A previous User's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter's outstanding performances - I agree entirely....
Positive	Great, great, great! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb want at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was great (Jerry O'connel is soooo cute!), the music was great (The sixties had the best music ever, imho), the historical material was interesting, and so was the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: GREAT!
Positive	I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really glad I did. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision really resonated with me. <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF, so can other artists. <br /><br />Would recommend this film
Positive	"Really, I liked it. The premise was good, the story fit where both respective series left off, and here's my favorite part. Mary and Valerie aren't bitter! They aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family""). In fact, Valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would be on the look for another...but if that doesn't quite work out, then they can re-run this one."
Positive	No hidden agenda. Pure scifi. All fun.<br /><br />I saw the original on TV and was scared pretty bad. I was a kid :)<br /><br />The original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which I saw and have forgotten. The original one, starring the great movie star Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the better and only version anyone should see.<br /><br />The movie production is dated, but the fx used to make the Blob stands up the test of time. I was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord. 10/10<br /><br />-Zafoid
Positive	"I enjoyed it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I do like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci/Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze. I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I watch TV & movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do so. That makes it a success in my eyes! I didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running. Whether or not it was rated as ""good"" or not doesn't really matter to me. And no, I'm not a juvenile. Nor am I a moron."
Positive	Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was that movie for me.<br /><br /> I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least, and I can say it is a good kids/family movie.<br /><br />I still have the tape, I haven't watched it in 5 years, but maybe I'll get around to it this week, and be a kid for the day.<br /><br /> You just have to love the care bears, and their messege.<br /><br />
Positive	Rob Roy is and underrated epic of passion and action!SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a towering performance as Rob Roy MacGregor,one of the best in his career.Jessica Lange is letter-perfect as his wife Mary.They have the most passion and chemistry I've seen in a screen couple.John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.Tim Roth portrays one of the great screen villains.His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing.He really is a magnificent bastard in this movie.The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swordfights ever.Well scripted ans scored,and Michael Caton-Jones direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
Positive	"Heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away! I didn't expect the delightful scene I was about to encounter. The ""call girl"" has her first customer and what a customer! One of the most erotic lesbian scenes I have ever seen. The husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey. It turned out to cost them in the end but, it was one exciting ride! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
Positive	Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.<br /><br />Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average idiot American moviegoer doesn't get bored.<br /><br />This anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best I can tell.
Positive	I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan, ever since I saw her series a few years ago!! This film certainly shows her in her best light yet!! The film was so wonderfully cast and played!! Every now and again she drops little amusing lines, just to make this film one of the best I've ever seen!! Everybody really out does themselves!! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the film come true!! Also I loved the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its best!!
Positive	Glacier Fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />The film makes you care about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic. Set against an inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts warm to the family members.<br /><br />The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.<br /><br />Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living, not just surviving beyond human endeavours.
Positive	Academy Award winner Robert Redford (Best Director. Ordinary People 1980) captures the majesty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this acclaimed adaptation of Norman Macleans classic memoir.<br /><br />Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman, and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul, an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world.<br /><br />Growing up, both boys rebel against their stern Minister father (Tom Skerritt).<br /><br />While Norman channels his rebellion into writing, Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction.<br /><br />Also starring Emily LLoyd as wild-hearted Jessie Burns.<br /><br />The film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematopghaphy in 1993.
Positive	What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie isn't like that. It is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable.<br /><br />Downside:<br /><br />Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind.<br /><br />Upside:<br /><br />Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives.<br /><br />Well acted by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte.<br /><br />Contains some good lighthearted humor.
Positive	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies: ""De Vierde Man"". This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible, which makes the whole experience even more intense. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional, and Verhoeven's direction does the rest. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite tame... It can't get much better than this, a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema. 10 out of 10, at least..."
Positive	This is a low budget film with a cast of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines substitute for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. The stock shot of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing at the old airport makes the transition perfectly. This film proves that you need neither mega budgets nor a headliner star to produce an excellent movie. It contains neither the gaffes nor the excesses that young filmakers often stumble into. Solid workmanship from people who know all the aspects of movie making and who understand the compromises between art and box office. An excellent piece of work!
Positive	BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier,comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny,and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v.s the evil rich guy.The one and only thing I didnt like about BASEketball,was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie,but,if the kid wasnt in the movie,some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed.If you have read any pro reviews about this movie,exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film.BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10.
Positive	"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and ""ficticious"" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland singing a song like ""They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."""
Positive	"Now here's a film straight out of my childhood, my family used to taped; but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years. Now I was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com; I had love this wonderful film when I watched it as kid, and after watching again (online), I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will always remember that sweet song forever). <br /><br />I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (on who animated who),that some of the animators date back to 1930s (WOW! that's like 47 years)."
Positive	The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. Naturally, the film takes place in Los Angeles/Orange County. He attacks stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and rings more true every day. It's the best description of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's also one of my top 10 favorite films.
Positive	Another Norman Lear hit detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />With Esther Rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a Chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman) as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just existing.<br /><br />The 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comical JJ to the militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also aspired to attain success, this show was a perfect description of African-American life.
Positive	I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and I loved it. (Still do, it has aged very well.) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Happily I'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />It deftly shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />Appreciation for this magistral film has grown, and I'm glad about that.
Positive	"This is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; actually, now that I think about it, this one is quite liable to be remade one day. It's pleasant, but with no depth whatsoever. It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call ""wit"". (**1/2)"
Positive	"I had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in ""Breakin'"", but I have to say that ""Breakin' 1&2"" carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better. It's a movie I will keep in my library, but it's not a movie that I can watch over & over again, just once in a blue moon."
Positive	"Disney might just be on to something here. First, they had ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel, a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie... yet another sports story based on truth.<br /><br />Both movies move you to tears at times, and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie. We were not let down, when asked if we'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a no-brainer. Most definately."
Positive	"Bette Midler is again Divine! Raunchily humorous. In love with Burlesque. Capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever. All in All Singing new ballads, power-singing the good old/perennial ones such as ""The Rose""; ""Stay With Me"" and yes, even ""Wind Beneath My Wings"". The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it, I strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries!"
Positive	I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did an amazing job! Not only is he an incredible actor, but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique! He did a great job on the delivery of his lines, plus transformed into George better than Fraser did. A great performance for his first major roll! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as hilarious. Two thumbs up on this one! I highly recommend it to everyone!
Positive	the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions.the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation. the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed. Ethan and Julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch. A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love. by far the most romantic(at least one of them) movie of all times.
Positive	On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I enjoyed this movie. Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was an usual excellent. He gets better with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide
Positive	"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that holds a viewer's interest time and again. Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars, but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation."
Positive	I have become quite fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was thrilled when I discovered this gem. I have always found it wonderful when I run across a film where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is charming till the final scene, and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938. I only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is well worth anyone's time.
Positive	I have passed several times on watching this since I figured it was some dumb, sappy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it is a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, it is not overly sentimental, touching as it does on themes of office politics, adultery, and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are headed, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest, and not everything turns out quite as you had expected. But, there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, seriously consider how well you want to know them.
Positive	In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a true example about a good German and specially, about a good man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are specially interesting. A true ideas' war: two different Germans, both with faith in there believes. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I recommended this film a lot, specially in this difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero.
Positive	this is what i call a great movie. it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story. there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic. but the main theme is very cruel, like live is.the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country (jugoslavia) on their way to the capital Belgrad. the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way, connect the people and the pigs that travel together. <br /><br />watch it and you gonna remember it for life... its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle.<br /><br />and another reason for its magic : it is hard to get!!
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it is nothing new.<br /><br />Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies, this movie has been miscategorized! Its not a war movie any more than ""One flew over the cuckoos nest"" is a asylum movie or ""Cool Hand Luke"" is a prison movie. This is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the costs of that personality type.<br /><br />The plot is the same as ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"", its in GOOD company, and it holds its own. Its these movies it should be held up against and compared, not ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Platoon"".<br /><br />Eric"
Positive	This movie earned every one of the ten votes I gave it! Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching. You showed the world,you can still write, direct, produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes. The poetry was awesome as well, hats off to the poets and musicians.<br /><br />I watched it last night, as I fell in love with my darling all over again. I will be adding it to my movie collection today, and recommending it to my friends and family.<br /><br />Please continue to produce quality, don't worry about the quantity....<br /><br />Thank you again, and best wishes and blesses to you!
Positive	"The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes. The man who ""steals the show"" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country."
Positive	"This is one a most famous movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles. It is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as ""Serie Noire"", ""Buffet Froid"", ""Beau Pere"", all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However, I would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French could be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."
Positive	"Always enjoy the great acting talents of Harry Hamlin,(Jim Lansford),""Strange Hearts"",'01, who plays a straight as an arrow husband, who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women, namely, Lisa Zane,(Lynne),""Monkeybone"",'01, who is a co-worker with Jim Lansford and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun. Annie Potts,(Kris Lansford),""Breaking the Rules"",'92,is a very warm and sweet loving wife to Jim and has complete trust in her husband. Kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself. This film will keep you guessing right to the very END!"
Positive	This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What drives the film is the characters, excellently played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama.
Positive	"This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it had won! Basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood quite often embraced Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list and deservedly so. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' ""31 Days of Oscar"" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, swish, nothing but net and the shot's so smooth, the net barely moved. Most solidly and highly recommended!!!"
Positive	this a great Disney flick.it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher,but suffered a career ending injury.but through series of events,Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster.this is a great family film.it is inspirational,but doesn't pour it on too thick.it's fun and entertaining.adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids.it is based upon a true story,though i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story.Quaid is sensational as the title character,very convincing.if you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy,look no further.9/10
Positive	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is hilarious, you won't be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic's more memorable videos (""Like A Surgeon"" and ""I Love Rocky Road"" among them), but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused. Die-hard fans will love it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals."
Positive	i really liked the film.at ending i was in tears.this film is incredible.go watch the movie. you will enjoy it.i could have given it ranking more than 10.i liked the teasing between chance and sassy.i like the leadership of shadow.overall this movie was perfect.<br /><br />its sequel is good but not good as this movie.i think there should be a third sequel to it.not only this film attracts children but also adults.my whole family enjoyed this film.Chance was full of humor.sassy is an intelligent cat.<br /><br />again i say THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH.the more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie.this movie is a classic.
Positive	I don't think I could have enjoyed it more, though certain things were disturbing. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to find out for yourself. At any rate, what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was developed sufficiently. Nothing seemed too rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were like-able, and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together, even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory...by matter of opinion. But like I said before, it's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Positive	Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile. <br /><br />Bo, looking more gorgeous than ever, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her 'dead' husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life. Can she find a fitting candidate? How will she do him in so Tony can do his thing? <br /><br />With Bo's attributes, John's unique direction, Quinn's film presence, and, thanks to John, a very pretty exotic look to the entire film, this movie is pleasant viewing.
Positive	Panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great pleasure, that Henry Bromell is a much better writer/director than that. <br /><br />The film builds slowly, with one quietly devastating scene after another, all enacted perfectly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most remarkable child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
Positive	"It has been 16 years since it's original run, I would have hoped by now some ""marketing wizard"" would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now, or at least sought to re-release the original 65 episodes. I can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up. Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts.The animation was above average quality for it's time, and excellent when compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, this may have sealed it's doom too. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if available."
Positive	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up after that though, it begins to drag. The acting and direction were terrific. In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script. At times, the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was good, but I expected more.<br /><br />P.S. Look for great cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
Positive	Right, then, he's absolutely brilliant. But you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. He covers (attacks?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich.<br /><br />For those of you are averse to swearing, this isn't for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will feel the fool.<br /><br />Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his best work. He simply shines.<br /><br />What might go so far as to say he is Glorious.
Positive	A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire. Downey is likable as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast. After an interesting setup, the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise, but Altman is always worth a look.
Positive	I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it's worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself. Apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick...Cheers
Positive	As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film. The characters have so many complexities, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, rather than being spoon-fed an opinion. You can love them or dislike them, and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life. I'd highly recommend it.
Positive	This movie feels like a film project. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work. Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though. Despite this amateurish feel, the movie is effective. It's like a cross-section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some predictable but well done conflict. Probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his Romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings. A good watch but nothing stirring....
Positive	"Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Expertly scripted and perfectly delivered, this searing parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you literally rolling with laughter. It's vulgar, provocative, witty and sharp. The characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject. Political correctness flies out the window in every episode. If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will not disappoint!"
Positive	Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is best character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was really exceptional.<br /><br />The other thing - impressive hand of the movie director. I give my respect. The serenity, the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively, I never met such proximity it in any movie before.<br /><br />Another thing left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, closest to the original books, and atmosphere in it. <br /><br />And little bit more. I pay my respect to the original Grey Owl.
Positive	The film is side spliting from the outset, Eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. The film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it. SO HINTS ARE VERY WELCOME. If any one likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it,it is worth the money and can't go far wrong.
Positive	There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Ten stars, and not a decimal less.
Positive	Robert Urich was a fine actor, and he makes this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same. People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I love the Halloween space suit idea, brilliant. This film is about the battle of one's sprit. TV quality, that exceeds, the big budget, Gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
Positive	"This movie is really good. The plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle. Fighting scenes are very good. There's a lot of different combat styles (although one of styles was a bit unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating show. The only thing which may be irritating is actors look. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so ""Five Venoms"" (or other its versions) is great choice."
Positive	"It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel.<br /><br />Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach! <br /><br />It's a surreal comedy--tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove."
Positive	I've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot. But i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now, and i wan tell it's one the best movies i've ever seen in my life !!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /><br />What you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie, if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end. <br /><br />The end is what makes this movie so good, you can't expect it.<br /><br />Congratulations to the Producer !
Positive	This movie is using cinematography fantastically, the depth of the camera catches each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on awesome performances though Washingtons accent does die in certain scenes. How is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. a worrying idea. Attenborough at his best since Ghandi, this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these, no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the SOuth African Apartheid.Though critised for the biased nature, the movie is faithful to the book by Donald Woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace
Positive	Despite its budget limitations, this is a great film, proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is a nice red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a well-animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies.
Positive	This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.Kim Novak's performance as Gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create Gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad!
Positive	I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Stone once again delivered a great character. She was just as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has those smart but tricky answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old... she looks amazing! I don't care if she's as fake as a Barbie. She looks good and that's that. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence, and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours! Half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it. So don't listen to them.
Positive	Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A teller in a bank, everyone walks all over him. Then his friend, a writer who's books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. And he manages to do just that.<br /><br />If it were not for the amount of death (murder/suicide/natural causes) in the film, this would be a farce. There are numerous jabs at marriage, politics, journalism and...life.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant is a likable amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is at her most appealing. Definitely worth a look.
Positive	"Seeing as the vote average was pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was ""just OK"", I didn't have much expectations when renting this film.<br /><br />But contrary to the above, I enjoyed it a lot. This is a charming movie. It didn't need to grow on me, I enjoyed it from the beginning. Mel Brooks gives a great performance as the lead character, I think somewhat different from his usual persona in his movies.<br /><br />There's not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that, but there are some rather hilarious scenes, and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch film.<br /><br />Very recommended."
Positive	I didn't feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless. <br /><br />It is original, although reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters.<br /><br />Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off, this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster.<br /><br />Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable! <br /><br />Scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing.
Positive	This is one of the funniest series ever! I laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor. If only someone would release in America. Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please. <br /><br />I know it being released in the UK but that's Region 2 and PAL besides! Let's give this series its fair shake. America must know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's quirky, goofy role in this. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure!<br /><br />Release this show in America! or Show it again on the PBS stations. I need to laugh and laugh again! Please indulge us, please! Please!<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
Positive	I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
Positive	If you like mech war games it's pretty good. Some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing. I've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genera then games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $350 to spare Steel Battalion. The movie is worth seeing at least once. There really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there. Less remakes and more original works. <br /><br />Enjoy
Positive	Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins. If you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. However I have no problems with that, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are adorable and it's fun watching them play and grow. My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter. I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent as Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, love the toys or enjoyed the original, this is not to be missed. 9/10
Positive	I'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones. The cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists I didn't see coming before each commercial. To me it was kind of like Medium meets CSI.<br /><br />Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video.<br /><br />Dedee was great. Haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly.<br /><br />If you're into to TV mystery movies, check this one out if you have a chance.
Positive	witty. funny. intelligent. awesome. i was flipping channels late one night years ago. came across this and a wildfire started. i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know. a few. like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did. the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. run don't walk. watch this and enjoy. intelligence and humor. it's a win-win situation. i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of....sanechaos.
Positive	Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but it is the Odd Couple that carried him to fame. This film really works. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well.<br /><br />It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets. The script bristles with humor from this situation. This had been done in some forms previously. This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package.<br /><br />Simon has done some other decent work, but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible. It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this.
Positive	Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along. Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done. In the updated tradition of THE PRINCESS BRIDE this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating. Eight out of Ten Stars.
Positive	"This incredibly formulaic flick from the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go. However, it's a fun little movie that gets the job done: it entertains. That's all it was meant to do and it does so. The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad. The acting is also decent, which isn't much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a fan of the genre (and of ""Walker, Texas Ranger""), you will definitely love this. If not, then don't waste your time. 8/10"
Positive	"The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star. A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (too bad they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!"
Positive	This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It shows a China I had never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows 1930's China in the most REAL light ever seen in a movie. It is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations, seeing how hard life was for the characters, and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful. You truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film. The actors are all perfect, such that you feel like you have really entered a different world. <br /><br />I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough. It may just change you forever once you have seen it.
Positive	Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex, it's just fine as it is. The cast are all very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very funny.<br /><br />A great Family movie 8/10
Positive	what can i say?, ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and like a Italian American, fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this movie.<br /><br />you know i really don't remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors . i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous Erika and that in this film she looks better than ever, i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie, i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating Erika's beauty.<br /><br />Well just to conclude if you are an Erika Eleniak's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you.
Positive	I really liked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general, and people too...one of the things I like about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the positive vibes from the film, there are other reasons to like Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has an outstanding cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling positive. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very dark. I would choose Grand Canyon over Crash any day.
Positive	"Those who know who know the Kelly ""legend"" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well. Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned (not hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat."
Positive	"You think you've had it tough? You should check out this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all. And significantly, after seeing this film, I learned that what is shown is not even the half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major feature (after ""Soul Food""), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. If you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check out this one."
Positive	"Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I couldn't wait to see it's final copy.<br /><br />Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time! It is great slapstick. The Russo Brothers did a fine job directing. The entire cast performs their best comedic acting... No slow or dry segments... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick. I was most imprest by William H. Macy as crook ""Riley"" and Michael Jeter's as ""Toto"" they keep you in ""stitches"". I believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie."
Positive	"This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, under-rated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more, and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so, but all in all, this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" both played their parts well."
Positive	"Well, I'll be honest: It is not exactly a Sholay. But you cant get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of ""not without my Daughter""(Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most ""inspired"" movies go, this one was a well-inspired one, well handled and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but all others are commendable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. In fact, she has performed much better that when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?<br /><br />All in all, a nice watch."
Positive	"This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just some brilliant ""Bruck-buster"" action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it does exactly what it says on the tin. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!"
Positive	Far by my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, so what, I still enjoyed it and loved it, was so funny and I adored the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic, the whole cast were brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker.<br /><br />I'd love to see this cartoon again, was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant. Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, i loved them
Positive	"Saw this at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards.<br /><br />I found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to Harvey Keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he liked.<br /><br />Certainly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso, it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in Cuba. However, don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution, it's political stance is wonderfully ambiguous. Many references to the directors obvious love of film history (a great ""Bicycle Thief"" homage"") and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentious.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
Positive	Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about. Taken at face value, a nice portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.
Positive	I'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.
Positive	"I used to love watching ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to get together every Friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />My favorite character was Salem. He was adorable and sooo funny. I liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, too. He was HOT. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a good teenage witch, too. My favorite episodes were ""Sabrina Through the Looking Glass"" and ""Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years"". Those episodes were great.<br /><br />Overall I really miss this show. I hope one day ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars."
Positive	"Excellent view of a mature woman, that is going to lose everything (even the pruner has a mortgage). The way she gets involved into this special ""business"", the innocence, and the true love that exists between the people of a little town, it's mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh, light and funny comedy. I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore.<br /><br />I love European films, and with movies like this one, my opinion grows stronger. A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed, in this same genre, is Waking Ned Devine.<br /><br />Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself. You will love it."
Positive	It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, I don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. It isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, pretty simple, good chemistry between the leads, and a fun watch. I'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. I'd watch it again...with a girl.
Positive	This is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist, and am I glad he did! The blend of British humor (should I say, Humour?) and the reality of a lost, middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot. Add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot (those plants under the bushes were NOT going to make it without the TLC they received), and it is a truly hilarious, yet touching film. I laugh every time I conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the Brits definitely got this one right!! 10/10
Positive	I think you would have to be from the USA to get a lot of the jokes. But if you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, You would like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times better than Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I like. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.
Positive	I second the motion to make this into a movie, it would be great!! I was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game. I have played it again and again (over 20 times) just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time. Final Fantasy eat your heart out!! THIS SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!!!!! If anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie, please contact me. I would love to help with that project any day. The graphics are great for PS1 and even make you forget it is PS1 most of the time. The multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play.
Positive	I was especially delighted that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played very well, too, and I liked the script following Shakespeare's original text so faithfully. But I must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little surprised even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I liked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
Positive	"""What would you do?"" is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional Brokedown Palace. You will also be left wondering if Alice (Danes) was telling the truth or not - a issue that is left unresolved, and rightly so. This is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film. Although it is slow at times, its pace is reflective of the story line - but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat; wanting to know what happens next. The ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters, which are brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is commendable, too."
Positive	The only complaint I have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right? Other than that, this is very good-quality. All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's worth watching at least because Toby Stephens as Gilbert is the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen I would have conveniently forgotten I was still married the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book.
Positive	If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin....do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. I'ts so brilliant and a very cool production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is amazing. There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it. I really do hope people will find this as intriguing as I did!
Positive	"Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />""...the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get Goebbels himself into our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. The idea of getting to Goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook.""<br /><br />Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO"
Positive	I don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, twisted, and psychologically sophisticated. You won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It has layers within layers, nuanced acting by Stone,and a plot that will keep you guessing even after it's over. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48,and that Michael Douglas isn't in this one. I predict that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Give it a shot, you might be glad you did!
Positive	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are great, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so well together. I can watch this film anytime.I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.<br /><br />A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
Positive	Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles a...(read more)nd Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their particular way of directing. In this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with great performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness, separation, unexpected encounters and love.
Positive	i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated film.anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies;jfk, rfk, mlk,g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about.roy tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to mention a few.the conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential history.god help us,but the domino principle is more fact than fantasy.if this causes a little loss of sleep, maybe it should.don't take my word for it,investigate for yourselves.
Positive	This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is attracted to him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it still is captivating and interesting. Because she doesn't speak, we don't know here mind very well, but in the end we can guess.
Positive	"A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash. Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a good, light movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack rocks, the outfits are out of this world, the script is funny and the actors do a great job. The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broke. (You must look up the movie ""Clockwatchers"" ). If you watch Party Girl you are bound to have a good time. Enjoy!"
Positive	Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years. She said that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extraordinarily well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly. I agree! What a chilling and tremendous film. I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly. My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film. Many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did.
Positive	Pierce Brosnan the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is very very good at what he does, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man. Now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they begin to talk. Then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be this funny, but he really is and I must say this movie is a must see.
Positive	"Damn straight.....this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today. I can't wait to track down some of the DVD's to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes. I've already introduced him to Voltron (the 5 lions one, not the 15 vehicles one)and I laughed my head off when he said to me one day ""Dad..you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid!!"" How cool is that.<br /><br />Come on Hollywood, dust this one off and give it a live action attempt. Couldn't be any worse than Spiderman 3 was...Man oh man... 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies.<br /><br />OK, I'll shuddup now<br /><br />Cheers"
Positive	Maybe I'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes out. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them. Don't worry they're tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! There's a lot of humor and comedy in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice: Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal...cornyness! I suggest everyone checks this out...you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
Positive	I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, better than the trailer. The story was non-Western, but I think we are all used to this from many other movies. It wasn't at all hard to follow. The acting by the leads was weak, but other people were quite good. There was humor throughout, too. I rated it at 8 because I had a good time watching it, which is what I went for.
Positive	"This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even better, you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be amazing.<br /><br />A good blend of comedy (although not as great as ""Mr Magoo""-another one of my favorites) and action. This deserves 10/10 and I'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon (fingers crossed). If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :)."
Positive	An interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period. Altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
Positive	"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profiler plots are quite simple. Fortier's plot are far more complicated... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to spot similarities... The main character is weak and weirdo, but have ""clairvoyance"". People like to compare, to judge, to evaluate. How about just enjoying? Funny thing too, people writing Fortier looks American but, on the other hand, arguing they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language, or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial at all..."
Positive	"My family has watched Arthur Bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out. We have most lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is side-spitting. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's reply, ""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. ""Arthur is truly ""funny stuff""!"
Positive	"I watch Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thanks, Merideth. All the characters are well developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind the developed nations of the world. only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population. of course, not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me 10. you're reaching the hard ones - i will forever reserve the ""best episode"" place for this episode. Please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude."
Positive	"Reading a wide variety of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody. Happily, I couldn't have been more wrong. Granted, Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer/director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path."
Positive	This game is amazing. Really, you should get it if you don't have it. Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out. I believe that this game will always be a classic. It's just as good a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you are a fellow Mario fan it is essential. It's fun entertaining and challenging. Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics, (well it did come out in 1996.) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI!!! Nintendo is the best!
Positive	"""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasty.<br /><br />The story couldn't have been better; it's clever, has ""heart"" (emotion), and every character has a nice ""arc"" (a growth or change). By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz. There are tons of laughs and cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"". All of the actors turn in great voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is superb.<br /><br />This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""10"" I gave it."
Positive	'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised, but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essentially irritating person, is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film. Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names. There's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing, easy watch - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.
Positive	"this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away. Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not be missed!"
Positive	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie. <br /><br />It works really well as one of my favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in, say ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be, requiring thought, preparation, stamina and planning. I particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated.<br /><br />Through the feminist director Maureen Gorris (of ""Antonia""), Emily Watson with her big blue eyes gradually strengthens via her transformative relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are beautiful.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)"
Positive	If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a classic fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role. His trademark style of acting works well for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are well for their parts. I did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward. The king in particular appears a real dunce though, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart.
Positive	This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The Footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also received an Oscar for best photography, and deservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen besides them, and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one.<br /><br />It's unique and an overall great movie. The cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters. We follow their destinies with devotion, and get very emotionally attached to them. Along the way, we also learn things about ourselves and our lives. I think much of this film for what it represent, and how it present it. I warmly recommend it
Positive	There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick, smart, used well his whip and sword, and his voice was the best for any Zorro.
Positive	"""The Odd Couple"" is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation. People all know it, they hum the theme song, they complain of living with a sloppy ""Oscar"" or a fastidious ""Felix""...but they're under-selling the film without knowing it. This isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce. It's also damn funny from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that arises from realistic, stressful, and just plain awful situations. So, some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable, but I think its verisimilitude is its strength. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just cracks me up! My favorite comedy, by a country mile."
Positive	The movie held my interest, mainly because Dianne Keaton is my favorite actress. I disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted. I had no trouble following it (maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before). The movie was very sad and touching as well. What more do you want? Alexa Davalos is a fine new talent (beautiful too), and Tom Everett Scott does an excellent job with his part as well. The relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic, but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not. It was tragically sad but enlightening. It sure beat the other shows that were on TV New Years Day evening
Positive	I agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the 'spy' genre. My husband and I were captivated by it when it first aired in the US and watched every episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I did tape all of it) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy! Like others, I purchased and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot.) If the original version ever comes available on DVD, I'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was amazing. (He is always amazing.)
Positive	"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--who hasn't? I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a ""young adult"" when it left the air. Yes, it was great to see Mary and Rho together, and yes, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute. Example: the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about ""old people."" Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film ""bean counters?"" This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s."
Positive	I saw that when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. Whats Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. Whats sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent the kids will like this show, new words, songs, and watching them playing.
Positive	it's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone. but there are 2 minus points: - the level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring. - a lot of stories are not self-contained (if you compare to f.e. coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline or however you wanna call it) but well, most stories are really good, some are great and overall it's one of the best movies this year for sure!<br /><br />annoying, that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum, i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single sequences...<br /><br />well, i think that's it!
Positive	"I think this still is the best routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are hilarious; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also funny in a tearful way - but this routine has no errors. All the jokes are funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is perfect. Just long enough to last 20 years. I just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool. Not putting in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, god bless."
Positive	Another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never-ending crop of crud emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of life and living. No, definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves.<br /><br />The dynamics of all of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are magnificent, heart touching and highly thought provoking.<br /><br />Sit back, relax, and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.
Positive	"I always thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, I was wrong. ""Election"" is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama, taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly on the move, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit."
Positive	This is possibly the best short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does an amazing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama. The other actors are of course great too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is fantastic mainly because you don't really get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person.
Positive	"I thought this movie was very well put together. The voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me glad. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy ""profesor"" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!"
Positive	I first saw this film when i was about 13. It blew me away then and in many respects it still does now. But i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now. There is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism - and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.<br /><br />This all makes for a great film story, but it worries me that people see the portrayal as 'accurate'.
Positive	I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br /><br />I would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed.<br /><br />Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50:s and the political climate of the 70:s. When i think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them.
Positive	My mom and I have just recently become addicted to this show, laughing our butts off! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so great, but they're still funny!). I TiVO every episode of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, never leave me bored while watching! There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. There is some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
Positive	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable, and you find yourself cheering at the end! At least I did!
Positive	"Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment ""big dummy that I am."" Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. No one should miss this picture."
Positive	"Actually this movie has silly moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like ""The Wiz"", ""Captain Eo"" and ""Ghosts"". But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't complain too much about it. Just seeing this lovely guy and hearing his wonderful music is a trip to Heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good at all, and I'm afraid, that it would get a much lower grade for me, if my darling Mike hadn't been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the moonwalker, it has to get a 7 out of 10 from me."
Positive	I gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie, but for it's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience. The story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now, but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple.<br /><br />It also showed a different side to the African-American experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man' and were abusive of their own people. I find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend.<br /><br />Also the acting performances are superb - especially Oprah who I now have a new found respect for.<br /><br />Well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy.
Positive	"The third, and final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is the most concrete of them all. The ""training"" even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old Japan to incorporate Western technology. Where the first Hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to it's plot, ""Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold"" manages to connect everything, and brings it all home in the end. Definitely the perfect finale. Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there's a lot of needless blood and violence (it *is* Hanzo the Razor after all)."
Positive	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker together. This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously. The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it's release and had it come out today it would be a hit. Don't bother trying to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
Positive	"Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), <br /><br />City of Lost Children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), and<br /><br />Dark City: <br /><br />These really ought to be added.<br /><br />For a while now, I've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has. This one is the 1st.<br /><br />Hmm, scratch the ""animated"" part of that.<br /><br />I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it must be mostly love, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch.<br /><br />These people did an incredible job!"
Positive	Kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start. It really is this flawless ambiance that makes The Shining the masterpiece that it is, in my eyes. Of course it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant. Plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
Positive	Let me state at the outset that I have Cerebral Palsy and I went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance. I left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had Cerebral Palsy in the role, even though I knew that was not the case. The performances were generally excellent, with a special nod to Brenda Fricker and to Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, brash, arrogant, at times vulgar and petulant-in other words, human. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, are excellent portrayals of life with CP. By no means a complete portrait, but fine examples of the disabled as human beings. Most highly recommended.
Positive	"To many people, Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning. His a crew member of ""Beat Street"" -a b-boy crew. The movie follows Lee in his average day, dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world. The movie has old school features such as<br /><br />Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, the New York City Breakers, and many more....<br /><br />Neither the movie Beat Street nor the Beat Street spirit will ever die."
Positive	I am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. Whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film, any comment would much greatly appreciated. The comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, im sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an A! I am also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' so if you have seen these films as well, i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page. Thank you.
Positive	This isn't as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who's side a particular character is on.<br /><br />The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows.<br /><br />The violence when it comes is brutal, no guns or martial art scenes with special effects, this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation.<br /><br />The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable.
Positive	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy. There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of the time. It has a real heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a big future and I for one, am looking out for his next project. The follow up is always the most difficut thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema.
Positive	"To me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. As a kid in the 50s thats all there was. In 1957 I saw ""The First Man Into Space"" in a movie theater with my Dad. It had Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer. Scared the Good & Plenty right out of me. The memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re-make only in full glorious color...that is wherever the scenes were well-lit. Just gotta love it for what it is......a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting noises, and that eerie music. Bravo !"
Positive	Series 2 has got off to a great start! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them. And this show makes you think like that! These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too. Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices!
Positive	A Chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist, warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war Japan, is accused of being a 'communist' and jailed for life. His loving wife, who supports totally her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from starvation. This movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential.<br /><br />This deeply moving and most 'human' feature is a must see for all 'true children' on earth.
Positive	This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You shouldn't go into it expecting that. This is pure girl FUN with the most fantastic cast of female leads. Like someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be. And the only downside I see to this film is that Tina Fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. The film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. PURE FUN and I recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.
Positive	I really liked this movie...it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you didn't, that is your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even though she isn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. To me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, it looks like they got all the clothes -blindfolded- at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together. All of the outfits were tacky, especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to make the movie look bad, because it definitely wasn't! Just go to the theater and watch it!!! You will enjoy it!
Positive	"Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the ""unknown man"" who heads the syndicate, and murders him.<br /><br />The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years."
Positive	"Has anyone been able to buy this movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was a Real (not Reel) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVD's these days.<br /><br />Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you."
Positive	"This is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must see if you love animals! Best Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Like when Sassy says to Chance; ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six I bet I loved that line. The storyline may seem hooky to some, but I like it. Shadow as the older dog who's preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in ""Homeward Bound."""
Positive	This one is a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film. This is the true story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this one! It's a great tale of courage and honor. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism slowly dissipate and everyone begins to respect men one at a time.
Positive	"I liked this movie. It was pretty cool. It has it all: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. It does not excel in any of this things, with the exception of the cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and LOT´s of car, with a great chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. It has some quality, and I liked to watch it. In fact, I loved the film. And I didn´t need to turn off my brains to watch it. I wasn´t always thinking ""Is this possible?"" or tramp like that. 9 in 10."
Positive	Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money you have to actually be INTELLIGENT. Not only that you've got to be brave, athletic, cunning, etc. It actually requires skill. Not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days. And yet, they only have two seasons of it! Bull..they need to bring this show back!! <br /><br />Although, they'll have a hard time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was great.<br /><br />But seriously, it was an amazing show. You never knew who would be going when. And it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to!<br /><br />BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!
Positive	Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It's film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress Thelma Ritter who steals the movie. As Moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information) she is terrific in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. Its amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated six times for an Academy Award and she never won. This should have been the role that copped it for her!
Positive	I am obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive, but I love it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now. For anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. Kidding... I am so happy to see there is a Season 3, because I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost...I enjoy watching TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television, but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment!
Positive	Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her. The supporting case seems quite good too. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing. Though, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows would be great companion pieces.
Positive	Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate, I have to say that The Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.<br /><br />The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very intrigued by the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. And I must confess, I'll forever look at my mom in a different light!
Positive	This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me all if I spell it wrong). This game would be own as the greatest James Bond game around.<br /><br />I give this a 10/10
Positive	Generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. However, I find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. For instance- What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For all we know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! Who knows! Maybe there will be a sequel? Maybe? If there is.. I cant wait to see it.
Positive	This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet, it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic. I highly recommend this movie, just because of its utter idiocy. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Positive	Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe. That is what I love about this film. The movie is kind of boring. For that, I take 3 stars off!<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The movie revolves around Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients, killing co-workers, and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is very bloody and gory. I would recommend it if you are into gore.<br /><br />I give this film 7 stars out of 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein Is Not Your Normal Everyday Dentist!
Positive	"Eytan Fox did it again : move the viewer's heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess. The movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is Tel Aviv.<br /><br />I was there a month ago and it is all there : the lifestyle, the relationships, the heart-beating city, the mess, the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted, blithe and oblivious megalopolis ever.<br /><br />Strongly recommend: it is a voyage for the heart and the mind, with an interesting perspective to the Israelo-Palestinian conflict.<br /><br />Nota Bene: There is central gay plot in the movie. If you do not think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as ""just love"". (and don't worry: the chick is hot too!)"
Positive	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it is still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson (writer of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series. Very good! 9/10
Positive	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first. The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem. I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable to Sedaris' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.<br /><br />I'm glad, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
Positive	"As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to get Biko's message out to the world.<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom"", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters.<br /><br />As one of two movies (along with ""A World Apart"") that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement, ""Cry Freedom"" stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved."
Positive	"I absolutely loved this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant. The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances."
Positive	"I have screened this movie several times here at college, and every time I show it, the number of people watching with me grows exponentially... in addition to the virgins, anyone I've already shown it to NEEDS to see it again! It takes a little while to get into it, but by the end the whole room is screaming, shouting, yelling, rewinding scenes repeatedly, repeating dialogue, and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is Pia Zadora in ""The Lonely Lady""! Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed, poorly written, horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own (no small statement, friends). For me nothing compares 2 U, Pia... and I don't suppose I'm the only one who's ever felt this way!"
Positive	One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching.<br /><br />One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be depended upon to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother Rick) a good story.<br /><br />Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best in folks, and this will keep you interested, and guessing, until the very end.
Positive	"Though derivative, ""Labyrinth"" still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. Finally a story allows Welling to show how he has grown as an actor. It's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of ""truth, justice, and the American way"" on a weekly basis with very little variation. His performance, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie, was quite believable.<br /><br />Welling rose to the occasion marvelously.<br /><br />As always, Michael Rosenbaum, as the ""handicapped"" Lex, delivered, as did Kristen Kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed Lana. Allison Mack, the ever-present Chloe, also scored as a slightly ""off-her-rocker"" version.<br /><br />The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama."
Positive	I loved this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series. I found it very heart warming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once again. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave. You could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they wished they had. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
Positive	I found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy. Brosnan is genius; as anyone will now testify, he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I've laughed as hard during any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favourite line would be 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse. I was also very impressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy. If you liked the dark and hilarious 'The Weather Man', you will definitely like this. <br /><br />I voted 10.
Positive	A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The love and support of the family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. The commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.
Positive	It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...<br /><br />Really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).
Positive	I liked this movie,,cute and funny.I found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word.Sorry to say that to the Yankee's fans.I recommend this picture for the entire family.Of course with your typical love/comedy movie,,there's a long moment in the movie,,with i'm in love and what do I do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments.The movie show's some moments of how the Red Sox nation( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand.
Positive	This Movie has great fight scenes. Now its true that the acting is a little rough. But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But If you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with Amazing stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix. Then Watch this. Now it's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie. But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p**s his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit threw and admire.
Positive	"What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining. ""Right to Die"" is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore.<br /><br />Spoilers here: <br /><br />Top credits also go to the dead-on performance from Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen. Playing the character in a great ""aloof"" fashion, you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts.<br /><br />End of Spoiler.<br /><br />As a revenge-from-the-dead flick, ""Right to Die"" benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an OK way to spend less than an hour."
Positive	I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/ actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very engaging.<br /><br />What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world. Without preaching, and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities, and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
Positive	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. Its greatness held my attention to such an extent that I focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration. I would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism within it is breathtaking. I've heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions. I'd like to find more works by whoever made this, and see them."
Positive	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick.<br /><br />While not up to ""Sleuth"" standards, ""Deathtrap"" is none the less a very capable, twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material, with Caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto.<br /><br />The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall ""Deathtrap"" is solid, well acted and suspenseful fun."
Positive	One of the best movies out there. Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest, but an excellent plot and concept. Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and great fun. One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies. Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while. The sets are not amazing, but simple and worked for the overall look of the film. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a great view and very fun.
Positive	In the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s Innocence, which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances, the kind, in fact, that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again. It would be nice if this could get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where there's just an outside chance it might 'speak' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at.
Positive	I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future. The film is funny, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it does - or will - soon. this is destined to be a real indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival.
Positive	I loved this movie!!! The characters were people that you could feel for. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together. The most touching scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I laughed in parts, cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. In fact I've re-watched it about 5 times. A definite must see for total romantics.
Positive	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the funniest one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director. I'll stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end. The final scene was especially a hoot so on that note, go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres!
Positive	What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie.
Positive	You like to solve mysteries? You like complex narrations? This is for you. Brilliant, clever movie by Francis Leclerc(son of a legendary french Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashy photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly helped by Roy Dupuis who's dythirambic in the lead role.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a deer's sufferings on the road. Throughout the struggling, he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over him.<br /><br />Not spooky, but very mysterious and well played movie. I have my hypothesis on the ending(I think the Indian caused the accident) but this ending was open to any explanations.<br /><br />I strongly recommend it 9.5/10
Positive	This Alec Guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry, and a light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. But it does have its amusing moments, and it is very deft in its execution. The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite droll, very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy.<br /><br />I don't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
Positive	I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be as well done as they were, nor did I expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it. I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick, nor did it over embellish that fact. The characters all had human traits. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two thumbs so far up. Definitely the best movie I have seen in the past five years.
Positive	This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.<br /><br />Moving at a fast pace (the film runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and characterised, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and evil sides of the same person.
Positive	I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is for sure the best one I have seen so far.<br /><br />The story in it self is nothing special really, so I won´t go deeper into that. What makes it special is the stunts, the fighting, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it. All the cool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself)makes you want jump around in the couch and scream. It´s just awesome! Even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw it.<br /><br />I know this Police Story can be a bit hard to get a hold of, at least it is here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it´s worth a try.
Positive	"Overall the film is OK. I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in term of its story, its sentimental value.<br /><br />There are a few scenes that makes me touched. Yes I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) did his acting very good. Brilliant. I can say that his acting is almost natural.<br /><br />However, the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really ""'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma' "".<br /><br />I love the song. Both the song. ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" and ""Hujan"". I just downloaded the song. Beautiful.<br /><br />And salute to Yasmin. The movie's ending credit makes me touched again. We can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.<br /><br />I think the movie deserves that Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival.<br /><br />I give 8.5 out of 1o stars."
Positive	Contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. They are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.<br /><br />I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting. I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. I'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. It's a great example of both.
Positive	I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards. As could be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. I was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right. A film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a wonderful film and I think it brought many people (including some that now give negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
Positive	"""the day time ended"" is an incredible picture. in some ways, it's better than ""close encounters of the third kind."" (i prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars.) the special effects ARE cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film. it's probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature. the musical score is very good. the story DOESN'T make sense. BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING. like many of the best works of art, ""the day time ended"" isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. ""the day time ended"" may be a low budget indie film, but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the ""existential"" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)"
Positive	This is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minuets of it and I must say this is a good movie. The plot if funny and because there's sex around pretty much every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I don't see how anyone could NOT like this film. I really really really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has one slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is a great movie. I rate this movie an 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. PLease if your a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there's pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie. It WILL please you.<br /><br />10/10
Positive	This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was truly innovated. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. Indeed, she looked like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece, the story withstands the test of time; it has not gone stale. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic, well-staged and highly effective. That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must.
Positive	Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film? I LOVE it! One of my Top 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel good. I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over!!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE babe of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are. This is a very good film, it is very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
Positive	This first part of the BRD Trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but less of the magic of Veronica Voss. The political musings have point to them: we see the shortages after the war, how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life (delicious moment when Fassbinder, playing a grifter, tries to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla, who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth: she really wants firewood).<br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, interrupted by Hermann's appearance should go quicker. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so bad. But as the story develops and the years go by, I was drawn more and more into this glossy, cold world.
Positive	How can't you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but History! This is the first `real' movie of cinema history (`le Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough ) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is a beautiful shot! And it's very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that! What a moment! Historic for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for art later. A movie to venerate!
Positive	hi I'm from Taft California and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination we've beat Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since I'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we've had running backs lead the state and I'm next if you want to know me I'm kyle Taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
Positive	By 1955, five years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. Their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a Universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic. Buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known - and that's not counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps ten years later the 'psychological' western was well entrenched but in 1950 it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned. One to add to the DVD collection.
Positive	"Probably Bigas Luna's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's ""Lifeforce"" in the buff, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust. He can't get May's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother, too. His pursuit of May IS the film. As in Luna works such as ""Lulu"" and ""Jamon! Jamon!"", the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale. The usual suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast. José Luis Alcaine's images are gorgeous and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do so naturally."
Positive	If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty good. I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end. Acting is great, story is absolutely original, flash-back technique very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I forgive that cause I see it as a homage to, rather than a rip-off of, Orson.
Positive	As a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's almost a must-see and rates a 9 as a variety show! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her put over a song better than she does here. Randolph Scott is memorable as well, even if he doesn't see much screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence, if nothing else!<br /><br />
Positive	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent, not only in the visual beauty, the writing, music score, acting, and directing, but in putting across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path. I am very pleased, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man. I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do.
Positive	Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
Positive	I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott (2000). Both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. In both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001).<br /><br />
Positive	"A nice Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being ""seen and not heard"" needed to be made up for. Aside from that this is fun. Given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very progressive and liberal. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for Temple. That makes it worth watching if you're a Temple fan. For others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."
Positive	This is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting. I never tire of watching it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character namely Simon and Mack have brunch together. Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often. SO its a very 'real' movie. <br /><br />One of the most powerful scenes in the movie however, is at the beginning of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car has broken down. The movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where there's one person preaching his guts out to an audience. Instead the actors' emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words. And lastly, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
Positive	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly good! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting. With only one 'toilet humour' gag, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a good film are all there; script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time!
Positive	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the funniest movies, I´ve ever seen. I don´t understand, why this movie didn´t get better critics, it´s funny, harmless and sweet. I first watched it, when I was 11, and I really fell in love with it... 2 days later, I got it on VHS :-P Till today, I´ve shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but nobody knew the movie before. I think, that´s the problem, nearly nobody knows it, so nearly nobody can like it... This movie never got a real chance, that´s sad, ""SI"" has really the potential of a comedy like ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Spaceballs"". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to laugh your head off, watch it! Even if you don´t get mad about it, it´s worth watching! --> Prepare to laugh, earth scum!"
Positive	I enjoyed this film very much. Many Korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was average. The movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular. Editing, however, was very neat and unusual.<br /><br />The acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul usually played an innocent, weak girl in the Korean soap-opaeras. But this time, she plays a cute tomboy very well. Kwon Sang Woo also plays his role very believable.<br /><br />What I like the most about this film is, the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated. There are many Korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and I always thought it was very stale. There was no such crap in this movie.<br /><br />Very funny and well-done.
Positive	"I just watched this movie and have to say, I was very impressed. It's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! I had to smoke several ""emergency"" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticise, I'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming.<br /><br />Although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor. It had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!"
Positive	Hey guys I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! I played Pete, the main characters son. It was a great experience and i loved every minute of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. I still act and do some TV, but not as much. Oh and if you want proof my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.<br /><br />Review: I thought the movie was okay but if i wasn't in it, it wouldn't be one of my favorites. I thought the acting was really good, but the story line was only so-so.
Positive	I went to see it 2 times this movie, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party, and he was telling me it was so great, that I was expecting very much about the movie, to mutch, I couldn't enjoy it because I was not watching it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a party. I LOVED the music it's just great.<br /><br />If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about. If you can delivere this movie as your first you must be talented.<br /><br />The acting is done by some great belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of upcomming talents like Titus De Voogdt.<br /><br />
Positive	This movie needs to be put on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, really cute and funny. Not realistic, but not suppose to be. The only thing I did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an over looked Classic film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all ages. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is unsinkable, a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
Positive	After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is spellbinding!! I absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off. The richness of the characters, the intricacies of the plot, the beautiful setting are all amazing. I am totally and completely hooked. I don't know how the creators do it, but each character touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! I don't have cable so I've been renting the series on Netflix. When I put it on I watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over. I can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house. This is probably the best TV show I have ever seen!!!
Positive	"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most surprising and delightful film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; I gasped out loud when I learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. It's like some loopy episode of Oz, and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real."
Positive	"I have looked forward to seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were dead on. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.<br /><br />Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.<br /><br />Natasha's screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that anything she is in goes on my favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for.<br /><br />God Bless her, her family and future endeavors.<br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to available in DVD or video yet, but I would be the first to buy it and I think others would too."
Positive	Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have made it so. Guiness' performance (and a great supporting cast such as Greenwood, Thesiger, and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the film a delight, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama, romance, and suspense. Rating, 8.
Positive	Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating.<br /><br />The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran, and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law, some women try to sneak in, but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview, Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices, and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later.
Positive	It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
Positive	very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years ,but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it,John Toturro plays a psychologically challenged man ,nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces ,the game validates him as a person ,when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and John Torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion,even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.It makes you wonder if there other Luzon's out there who obsess about the game,i am sure they are,if you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch it.Its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well,it achieves its objectives,unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel.
Positive	this film is absolutely hilarious. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film. fantastic tacky fun
Positive	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most underrated ones. This is no regular comic superhero movie! It follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like ""Superman"" or ""Batman,"" such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually stimulating and very funny. Even if it doesn't turn into a franchise, it's still a joy to watch!"
Positive	I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,If this is so then I must go so lets do it.
Positive	There wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow I felt that this film handled a serious issue well<br /><br />It brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic<br /><br />Even today I have nightmares about corn on the cob, and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life<br /><br />I have to admit though, at one point in the film I did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home<br /><br />For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims <br /><br />This film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn, believe me, I've been there and I have the scars <br /><br />Watch the film, its amazing and educational
Positive	"I didn't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under-rated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, seek out the two-disc set and watch the ""Wadd"" documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie. <br /><br />Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; it's clearly identified as ""LAPD Crime Scene Footage"" on the menu!"
Positive	I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me. It was well cast and believable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it...
Positive	"I love these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history. It is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh, which it does. How they ever got these kids to ""act"" I'll never know. I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mind set."
Positive	"I've been watching this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's.Woodstock,Easy Rider,The Beatles,The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the ""Drug Years"". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the American culture.From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs effected the arts (music , movies etc.) Featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel footage.<br /><br />Drug Films: The Trip Easy Rider Up In Smoke Reefer Madness Blow Boogie Nights"
Positive	I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace, I loved it and would like to see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him, and he turns into an eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace, it is the boy. I was always fascinated with legends, particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this released someday to a DVD, PLEASE RELEASE IT, whoever's concerned!
Positive	This film enhanced my opinion of Errol Flynn. While Flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to throw in a couple of high-falutin' European terms!), this film gives him an opportunity to stretch (albeit only slightly) as an actor, as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match. The supporting cast is excellent; everyone seems well-chosen for their roles.<br /><br />The story moves briskly and, while not particularly profound (it misses, perhaps intentionally, the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time), it certainly entertains and satisfies. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also reasonably faithful to history. I also really liked the great depictions of 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there's little not to like about this film...very well worth the time to watch it.
Positive	As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition sexy Jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! Not to be missed an adventure classic.
Positive	I voted excellent for how well the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.
Positive	Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously! Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom.
Positive	"Has there ever been a movie more charming than this? One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the ""romance"" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies (including ""You've Got Mail"", the recent update of ""Shop"") they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs. Everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with. A must see! **** out of ****"
Positive	I watched this film in shire joy.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much out of it it's amazing. There are parts that are moving, funny, and just great.<br /><br />All aspect are spot on, the portrayal of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% genuine, even small Irish subtleties have been covered.<br /><br />The use of low and high shots gives two great views on Cristy (look out for that).<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor do that, ever. It really is amazing.<br /><br />And it's so great to watch, it flows so well, it's probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience. I love it.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you should see it. Don't have any doubts on it, there is something there for all.
Positive	"Watching ""The Fox and the Child"" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visuals, integrity of point of view, and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure.<br /><br />The plot is uncomplicated. Deceptively simple. Within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />I laughed. I wept. I learned.<br /><br />This is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to. Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart. It reaches to the heart of the viewer--of any age--and reveals the world through new eyes, as if seen from the heart.<br /><br />Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality. I feel I have been privileged to watch--no, to participate in--this film, a work of true Art."
Positive	The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. Even though these subjects had an important impact on Doyle's life, I was more curious about the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were excellent. We finally got a look inside Doyle head, how he created Holmes and why he had to 'kill' Holmes. The actors are excellent. Including the intriguing Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a compelling role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations are good, especially for a TV movie and the camera work is nice. If the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece.
Positive	Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthwhile movie. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy. Well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.
Positive	If you haven't seen this, you do not know what you are missing. The first time you do, you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard, and having probably wet yourself as well.<br /><br />It is THAT funny. There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close. So many classic one liners, stories, and segways..<br /><br />The drunken uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.<br /><br />Pure classic!! Shame you can't get it on DVD..<br /><br />Rating 10+ out of 10
Positive	Going into this movie, I had heard good things about it. Coming out of it, I wasn't really amazed nor disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies. There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene. I totally gotta try that out next time I find myself in a club. A couple of stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene. She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull. I might add, Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie. :3
Positive	When Paris is Burning came out, I totally dismissed it. I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be campy and silly. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I ran out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as though I knew all of the characters personally. The 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture. What a terrific job! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them. If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know. <br /><br />I hope they make another documentary. I LOVED IT
Positive	This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. It is very entertaining and also very disturbing. The acting in this movie is well done. The story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out. Character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it. Not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece.
Positive	"BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is an off-the-wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to ""psyche-out"" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the craziest things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking ""Wow this this over already?"" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines, and it is very fun to watch!"
Positive	"I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin' genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderfully street, hilarious writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he sure did _get_ the street scene of the East Coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon's writings; ""the Lemondrop Kid,"" and ""Little Miss Marker,"" both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly funny, too!) Damon Runyon lives!!!!"
Positive	Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been exceedingly hard on Alexandre. Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre, he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual, as most of us are, however hard it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly, being totally taken care of, getting and giving what he wants. the girls are allowing this, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything wrong with any of this? is anyone in love? really? i don't think so. Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on, it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion. Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in Alexandre's position, in an urban area can ask for. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
Positive	"While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.<br /><br />""Carmen"" is another great movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality (with the dancers) or fiction (of the play). Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Carmen"""
Positive	Gentleman Jim is another case of print the legend, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath. It's as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Flynn's The Charge of the Light Brigade - this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out, filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by Raoul Walsh's vivid direction. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you'd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production), with Alexis Smith a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Indeed, even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout! The 103 minutes just breeze by.
Positive	"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was pretty good. It's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It's not wild like ""Snatch"" but it's interesting and it has some rough characters.<br /><br />It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing a couple of big surprises.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is a different kind of film and well-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far more than just a beautiful face."
Positive	Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading. The genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches, too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories, making it formulaic and overly predictable.<br /><br />The Shop Around the Corner does not suffer from these illnesses: it manages to create a recognisably middle/eastern-European atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the (also strong) nominal leads; I avoid using the words 'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek (Frank Morgan) has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the romance.<br /><br />The 1998 film You've Got Mail borrowed the 'anonymous pen-pal' idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake. This is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie - it shares the genre and borrows a plot element, but that is all.
Positive	A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. And IMO, it succeeds at being a nice film. It's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.<br /><br />7 out of 10 broken hearts
Positive	He-he-hello!! This is a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun-lovin', independent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her party friends, she meets a mature Turkish Vendor. It is a comming of age story for those new adults who are searching for what they want to do. It is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman. Hope is given to all of us slackers who might feel like their only skills are being able to maintain while hammered and a nack for throwing good parties.<br /><br />On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie great. I have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me just want to watch all of her movies. There are subtle manerisms that perfected her character. If you want good laughs and a fun time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are a must.
Positive	"""The Man in the Moon"" is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan magically re-creates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting, lyrical musical score. This film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times.<br /><br />This film is incredible, all the acting first rate, especially Sam Waterston and an astonishing performance by Reese Witherspoon in her film debut. You will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion.<br /><br />""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991, and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it. Buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art. This film is truely the essence of filmaking at its finest."
Positive	"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in ""The Sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in ""Goodnight Mr Tom"".<br /><br />Superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art.<br /><br />When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. They also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a mushy mess.<br /><br />If you keep a CD or video library then this feel-good made for TV movie is an absolute must inclusion."
Positive	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools. <br /><br />10/10
Positive	tom had a wish to make film for a long time and he did. it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he has been filling up and carrying around for 10 years. no grant character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just life and a little bit of magic. the balance, in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how nice it was. the music is great and your eyes will be equally satisfied. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining, it is brilliant because it is empty. in between the lines it is happening. to see or not to see, that's the ?
Positive	Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement--well, it says so right on the back of the box--and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters--including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues--embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's incisive and essential, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Positive	All Kira Reed fans MUST see this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully, Kira gets a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids, safe sex). Later, she marvels to her publishist how great it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the best of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out, and marvel at the greatness of Kira.
Positive	this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre. the only problem i had with it was that i didn't like Zelah Clarke. i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid. in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character. i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her. the part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh. i think they made a bad choice in casting her. but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester. he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing. another thing that made this version not quite 100% was the quality of film. i know it was made in the eighties for TV. if it had been a feature film, and better quality, it would have been perfect. my main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
Positive	This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can appreciate just how good of a story it is, how very well written the script is, and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money.<br /><br />All the elements of a great film are here. The visuals, though shot on digital, were gorgeous in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just amazing. It's such a trippy piece of work, but not done in a pretentious way, and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film. It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there.
Positive	I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie.It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990.A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment.Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors,drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television.I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure.It is quite possibly the best worst movie ever.We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish.We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect.It is a true gem.The laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever.If you see this movie for rent in a video store,steal it.You won't regret it!
Positive	"After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I truly enjoyed watching ""Fried Worms"". For once, I did not guess the ending! It was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross-out humor, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) both LOVED it too -- oh and my 45 year old ""boy"" had a smile on his face the whole time. This is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. ""He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!"" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act a little goofy -- but my favorite scenes involved the Dad getting used to his new job. Have fun!"
Positive	Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but I LOVE this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. <br /><br />Powell is very suave and great as Vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he IS Vance! Mary Astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production. Everybody else is very good too, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He's a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious.<br /><br />Basically, an excellent 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Well worth seeing.<br /><br />
Positive	"An unqualified ""10."" The level of writing and acting in this Australian movie is reminiscent of the very best of ""old"" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Streep line for line, and take for take -- it is one of the best showcases yet of his prodigious acting talent and he is at his sexy and gorgeous best, notwithstanding the intensity of his role. This engrossing film is a treat for any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom drama, portrayed in the most human but unsentimental terms. The movie -- which won several top awards in Australia -- boasts not only a superlative cast and director, but wonderful and authentic Australian locales. It proves that people are the same the world over. And, after all these years, people still delight in repeating the famous Streep line, accent and all: ""A dingo ate moy baby!"" Including that imp ""Elaine Benis"" on ""Seinfeld."""
Positive	Was lucky enough to be an extra in this great film and loved every minute of the filming. Went to the premier in London and had a great chat to Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife.Fantastic after party too. Then a few weeks later had trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant film, it deserves to be up there with all the great biker films. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it neither can the kids. Get a bit of stick from the club who seem to think I'm a film star now oh well one can only dream. I think they are just jealous. The only downside of the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain but hey we was in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow up so keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck
Positive	They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?
Positive	"This was an excellent 2-part episode, although I had never been seen the older ones, I never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal, extra terrestial of course but not paranormal.<br /><br />This episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible.<br /><br />Being that it's a family film I am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if its also going to entertain American audiences. But who care about what Yanks say, we rock! Doctor Who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans will one day soon say ""The old Doctor Who has returned"".<br /><br />10 out of 10"
Positive	German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: Screwball.<br /><br />You can't stand screwball comedy? Don't watch Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to Law&Order or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or watch Law&Order as it's quite brilliant at what it does, but I digress.) E&S is funny, often addresses thought-provoking themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny, and witty, too.<br /><br />Frankly, I am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. And my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />In short: Watch it. I don't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
Positive	Saving Grace is a feel good movie with it's heart in the right place. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in a beautiful village where most viewers would love to live and the villagers are all wonderful people most viewers would love to have as neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it portraits the effect marijuana has on it's user. It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film actually ever did smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by English slapstick, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less very enjoyable.
Positive	It seems to be a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help.<br /><br />John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. There is a double question the movie poses. How far would you go to help the man that you love, and on the other hand - observing Stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - does she really love her husband? Like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself.
Positive	So i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, with very few shows i simply WILL NOT WATCH.<br /><br />this show, however, i would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Quite possibly the most Original series to date, it;s got just about everything i could ask for. A side story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted to, a very blatant comedy, and a very well put together voice acting cast (both Japanese and American translation).<br /><br />If not for the terribly funny aspect to it, it would be, just another anime.<br /><br />More or less, as i have noticed, a 'love it or hate it', very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it.<br /><br />Original to the core, with everything you could ask for in an afternoon, bet the house on this series. I'm ready to ASSURE you that you will enjoy it.
Positive	"""Purple Rain"" has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. If you are a Prince fan this is for you.<br /><br />The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. Sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works. Very hit and miss.<br /><br />No one can really act in the film. Everyone is from one of Prince's side acts like ""The Time"" and ""Vanity 6"". Still, it adds charm to the movie. When ever Prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /><br />In conclusion, go and see this if you love Prince like me. If you aren't a fan it'll make you one."
Positive	"Bette Davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film. The film seems rather dated now in 2003. It is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and Bette Davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today. It was startling for me to see how young Ms. Davis looks in this move. The actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard is well cast as Philip Carey, the club-footed medical student. This is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why. However, ""Of Human Bondage"" didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally. I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it. I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for. You be the judge!<br /><br />"
Positive	In the rapid economic development of 1990's in China, there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture, namely, the Confucianism, was not without disasters, because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.
Positive	Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) duel not just for Debra Winger's affections but really over a secret from their childhood that left them at odds over their powers.<br /><br />There are surreal touches (the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus), but there is also humour and romance. The soundtrack is great similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every great Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), setting his own trailer a rockin' to 'She's a lady' ~ priceless ;)<br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section btw ~ 'Once you've had a clown, you never go back!'<br /><br />I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the US) and if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't put you off ~ give it a try :)
Positive	"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his continuing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it were welcome. This movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man, but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness."
Positive	Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The script was very good as was the acting. The visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film. This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending. <br /><br />I was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever. <br /><br />This movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good.
Positive	"This 1939 film tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these kids were in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today.<br /><br />The film is only worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who showed they were well paired together. The Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />In a way it's curious how arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was the quickest way to turn a property around never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!"
Positive	"Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. Its a crime that he did not. Amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone did earn a well-deserved Academy Award for her performance. In fact, all of the acting in this film is excellent.<br /><br />The plot begins with a taxi ride, then an airplane ride, then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout. You will be entertained!<br /><br />However, this is only a blatant soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. You might call it the ultimate soaper, because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material. Excellently acted, well directed, but strictly within its soap genre. I wouldn't even call it a melodrama (such as ""Mildred Pierce"" or ""Imitation of Life""). While not denying the great entertainment value of this film, you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter."
Positive	"A patchwork about 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to Americans ""we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers"", sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved the Claude Lelouch (personal live of a couple in New-York, showing that our day-to-day ""problems"" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strongly anti-wars in general), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible day to day misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, having moral difficulties to accept the U.S. policy towards Arab countries) I am really pleased to see that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they ? I am still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested by other cultures, and able to question past and present actions of our government, like we should in a democracy."
Positive	"Everyday we can watch a great number of film, soap... on tv. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great film, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realisator-director. For me there are two films that everyone needs to see : the first is the Pacula ? ""Sophie 's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we need to learn about humility, about love of the others, about acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We also have to struggle against racism and fascim. We must avoid judging, criticize; we only have to love our earth companion. This wonderful film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his dream : Imagine all the people living live in peace. These two films are difficult to see : watch these, but sure you will be hurt, but better. Great film, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the others. Enjoy it."
Positive	Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty good film. A bit different. Grade: B
Positive	"I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called ""Roxy"". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a ""MC Santa Claus"".<br /><br />Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It's much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video."
Positive	I am sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is frankly kind of a boring Columbo to me. After a few times, I get bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles but the story was weaker in this episode than in the others. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young pretty wife played by Patricia Crowley to see if she is having an affair. In return, Culp's character blackmails the cheating wife who plans to expose his scheme to her husband ruining his career. Out of anger, Culp kills her by striking her in the face and setting the up the body elsewhere. I don't know. Maybe I just didn't care for this one at all. Of course, Columbo gets him in the end. It's just the question of how.
Positive	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />This is such an incredible film. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie you don't want to miss.<br /><br />I give this film 10 stars out of 10. Excellent film!
Positive	I recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it really made me laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. If you are going accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you have to accept that the other completely crazy bits of the show. I couldn't help smiling after every episode I watched. I really think it's great there is a show out there that can take a very strange subject and really make it great to watch. I absolutely love the narration, I think it adds that extra bit of wonder to the whole show. You can't always compare old shows by a writer to his new ones, you have to take everything as it's own entity. Definitely give it a chance, and just enjoy the ridiculous parts as they are.
Positive	"A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. ""Holes"" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in details. The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). ""Holes"" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. A must watch!"
Positive	I loved this movie. It is a definite inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rental or worth buying. It should be in everyones home. Best movie I have seen in a long time. It will make you mad because everyone is so mean to Carl Brashear, but in the end it gets better. It is a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines to keep you tuned in. I love a lot of the quotes. I use them all the time. They help keep me on task of what I want to do. It shows that anyone can achieve their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It is a long movie, but every time I watch it, I never notice that it is as long as it is. I get so engrossed in it, that it goes so quick. I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can.
Positive	I've joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is! It's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble. You've read the plot so all I want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble ,because that's the typical misconception people read in to,instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it. This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the Hollywood formula, just a great story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
Positive	"I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result I don't remember anything about the movie. But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song ""Lookin' for Love"" which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it.<br /><br />However, a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is, I was blown away. Few movies have hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's ranch house, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal. But no matter how you feel about country music (I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie. For that reason I love it!"
Positive	"Cor blimey. This film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy.<br /><br />The soundtrack is really good, and the set pieces are a joy to behold. I recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates, a few bottles of your liquor of choice, and prepare to be astonished and highly entertained.<br /><br />This carries on so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the true ""B"" movie tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find my self giggling at the scene where Zane prances down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style. All a bit mad, and all the better for it."
Positive	This is a great movie. I love it more each time i watch. Most comedies can get pretty lame because you know all the gags, but mystery men has so much integrity in the writing and characterization that watching once again -- as Ben Stiller tears at the hood ornament of the limo, or Hank Azaria says good-bye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his fuhrer choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles while he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses a kiss from Paul Reubens -- is a pleasure. This is pitch perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action sequences are creative and not too dominant, all the set-ups payoff by the end. Seriously, if you've seen it and it's been a while, watch it again, and if you haven't then get started. You can't watch it again until you've seen it the first time. (Wes Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too much good stuff!)
Positive	"Enchanting, romantic, innovative, and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled, exceeding better known ""death romances"" such as Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will find ultimate happiness at the end of that long-long stairway, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the tale, of course, is timeless: love conquers all. But the struggle to achieve that victory is played in a celestial arena of sweeping vision and gripping grandeur. With more than 500 suitably clad extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains memorable six decades later, far into the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderfully, determinedly romantic aspect of ""Stairway"" is captured with ultimate simplicity: June's teardrop, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This film, like the story and the set itself, is one for the ages."
Positive	Yes, some plots are a bit hard to follow, and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent, but it is actually an engrossing show, that I try not to miss. A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense, and the acting is fairly good, though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00. Still, why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing, but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable. It is true though, that it is more melodramatic than it was, but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. 8/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	"Big S isn't playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like, say Mencia or Chapelle (though I like them both). She states the obvious in subtle, near subliminal remarks. Her show won't change the World, nor is it meant to. But, along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of ""Mr. Show"" fame, this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction! My side's were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run- with-it. The best kind of comedy around. Spoofing anything and anyone, like ""Mary Poppins"" in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense. This one is highly recommended, but only for those who still have a funny bone (and didn't lose it in their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob job)."
Positive	"Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed ""Phone Booth"",'02, and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, showed his true acting skills in the role that he played. There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Enjoyable and entertaining film to view."
Positive	"The first time I saw this ""film"" I loved it. When I was 11, I was more interested in the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become more interested in the acting as well. While the first half is just a retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 up to ""Bad""), it was still entertaining to watch. The ""Badder"" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were funny, especially when the police officer tells Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's ""Smooth Criminal"" that's the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). The dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. The only thing I could have done without was the spiders. Any fan of Michael's should see this, if you haven't already. I give it a 10+!"
Positive	well worth watching, especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />This has to be Brosnan's best performance to date, he convinces admirably as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the return to his ?Aunts? where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue, just with expressions and good direction. Perfect.<br /><br />The story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. I hope so.<br /><br />Well done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Positive	the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and i thought it was absolutely brilliant! i love it! all the story lines are so good! and its a much more realistic view on teen and family life today. yet it still kept strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. their problems were real, and it really drew you into the show. the show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their lives. the family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). each episodes a day of their life, with coopers perspective on things throughout it. i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great. he was by far my favorite character. it ended with so many things it could've continued with, I'm really sad another season wasn't made. it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.
Positive	The performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.<br /><br />I wouldn't say you need any knowledge of the Kelly saga to stay with the flow of this movie but to comprehend the happenings and attitudes of the time you will require a bit of basic historical knowledge. Do not expect, as some rather silly people do, any of the characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country during infancy.<br /><br />OK, the story had some elements of fiction but these are required for a wider following of the film. Gregor Jordan said in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'inspire an interest', and that is exactly what happened with me so this movie gets the thumbs up here.<br /><br />See it and you WILL NOT be sorry
Positive	"After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer only their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality all alone.<br /><br />This really is often quite good and funny, with some decent lines (just check the memorable quotes) to boot. It will most likely appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me as seeing it again recently it proved much better than I expected it to be. Despite a cast made up of no-name stars, this may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever put to film. Interestingly enough, the Martians themselves seem to represent almost every classic Action Hero/Sci-Fi Hero stereotype there is (cool 50s teen, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and kooky scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /><br />""Prepare to DIE! Earth Scum!"""
Positive	"AG was an excellent presentation of drama, suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies. We rooted for Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising. This show lived up to the ""Gothic"" moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted, much less mastered. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current glut of ""reality"" shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.The call for a DVD box set is well based. This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. Bring on the DVD box set!!"
Positive	"OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a good way though.It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better ""stupid"" movies I've seen. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus here.She is lovable and adorable.Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.On top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning. Few men could disagree with that. The parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie.<br /><br />I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women. I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies."
Positive	Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. With that said, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing. the music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is worth the price of admission alone. the morning after i saw DiG! i went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols' sounds). Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. DiG! is a sincere, and sufficiently objective, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.
Positive	"Flat out the funniest spoof of pretentious art house films ever made.<br /><br />This flick exposes all the clichés, and then some! Excruciatingly bad (Downs-Syndrome!) actors. Terribly heavy self important dialog. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. All wrapped up in a kind of smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel.<br /><br />It achieves exactly what it was designed to. A hilarious satire of those tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders, to show to their parents when they ask them what they've been doing for the last two years! After ""What Is It?"" received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident.<br /><br />Anyway, see it and laugh, this will be a classic of humor for many years to come."
Positive	"Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions, so I turned to my twin sister and said, ""Hey this looks like fun,"" - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it. At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he never went through puberty, thus the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality... I cried, watched some more, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex, then cried some more. Once Jonni Kennedy's ""time was up"" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than ready; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not fall in love with this guy, you have no heart."
Positive	Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way. I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with fine acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists. It is a film about people and their lives, their mistakes, and their triumphs. A good film worth watching several times annually.
Positive	I can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't great either. The final fight sequence is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. But the English release suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.)Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701.<br /><br />Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. More focus on Li's fantastic physical skills were in order. Black Mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows Li's skills.
Positive	"From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I...<br /><br />Four women share this lovely small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends...<br /><br />...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual ""makeover"" for one great April vacation in early 1920's Italy.<br /><br />NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...)<br /><br />NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!"
Positive	Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it!
Positive	"Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was great not only because she's funny, but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum. White folks need to be reminded that Hollywood awards' ceremonies, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be no need for ""black"" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to ""white"" directors, producers, actors, etc. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was the depth of poor taste. He had no business being there. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar presentation I've watched since ""The Color Purple"" was up for awards. That miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until 2002. Which is not to denigrate other presenters. Billy Crystal is a riot."
Positive	"This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all the things a great Hollywood film has: Birth, death, happiness, sadness, exhilaration, despair, and so on. There is only one thing that irks me. I know it was a sign of the times, but neither of the two main characters are played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, the owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She does not even look Chinese! I think she tried to get the role, but they should have put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they didn't, and Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but they hardly tried to make her look ""authentic"". Stillm its a great film, especially if you read the book (I did in high school, decades ago). Its a must see, just look beyond the casting. I think you can."
Positive	Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but very intriguing, especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie,, Kiefer's partner,, is Eva Longoria,, the Desperate houswife. wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. This movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller, everybody played their part to the hilt. nothing was revealed to sooon in the movie,, so as to keep you guessing at all times. and i really think that Kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie,, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the besxt performance of the day,, thumbs up.
Positive	A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film. Also - a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL. I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.

Positive	I don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets, this movie rocks! Excellent movie, has it all, great music(Prince of coarse!), romance, and drama.<br /><br />This is really a very sad movie, very moving. I don't want to say TO much more, I;m not into giving away the plot, but I will say this-the film is VERY realistic, there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems, so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film. I see this as being very realistic and being so real, makes the movie that much more moving. My generation loved this movie growing up, so many of us loved Prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.<br /><br />That said, it's definetly NOT just a movie for teens, Id recomend it to all age groups. And it's not all so dark, the movie has some great music, band performance scenes, and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
Positive	"My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be ""Drunken Master"" (1978), followed by this film from 1985, ""Police Story."" In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can turn state's evidence. As the story goes on, the gangster sends his goons to dispatch Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. Like ""Drunken Master,"" ""Police Story"" has many of the signature stunts and over-the-top martial arts/action choreography that Chan has become famous for, climaxing in a battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan exceeds in excellence, giving a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. While light on the overall slapstick humor of ""Drunken Master,"" at heart ""Police Story"" is just that, a police story, a gritty cop-thriller that would be oft-copied over the years to come.<br /><br />10/10"
Positive	I'm a 53 year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, fast-paced and totally charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10 year old to follow, but twisty enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a superb job and the rest of the cast was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was a totally enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult males) savagely attacked the film. Apparently, they have something against films that portray strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist natures than anything about this wonderful family film. I recommend it strongly to every child and every parent.
Positive	"Sensual and tough Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a successful businesswoman being not only sensual but intelligent, ambitious, and willing to use sex whenever or wherever necessary: ""I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it"". While climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future happy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic.<br /><br />8.5/10"
Positive	I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />But there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.<br /><br />Some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5, but still is extraordinary. 9 out of 10.
Positive	SPOILERS<br /><br />A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me borrow it and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, really has no anything of what defines a movie ... but it is funny. And for what it is worth, Cheech and Chong show some heart.<br /><br />Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that would usually start a story. I will just say that Cheech 's cousin shows up.<br /><br />Was there no other funnier moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What about the rooster? Was that Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it awesome, but the movie has heart and hey, my buddy let me borrow it so it gets a 7.
Positive	This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a highly enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical clever American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his best (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly entertaining) police investigator. Furthermore you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a sweet tastin' cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - highly recommended!!
Positive	"I wouldn't call ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" simply a kiddie version of ""Jurassic Park"". I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it calls into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours. But it really opens my eyes when I see who provided the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. To paraphrase that: a given actor, the ""Cheers"" woman, the ""Tonight Show"" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the ""Young Frankenstein"" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br /><br />But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast. I thought that this movie had something for both children (purely fun) and adults (natural history). True, it's escapism, but the perceptive kind. I would actually say that John Goodman doing Rex's voice here is sort of a precursor to his voice work in ""Monsters Inc"". Worth seeing."
Positive	"I consider this movie a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it, so as to realize what a great movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown more ""humanized"". One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. Another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. Have you noticed that?"
Positive	"This is one military drama I like a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. There you have Billy Zane(""The Phantom"" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I don't! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. When the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you a pro like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. The movie was a direct hit. Watch it. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."
Positive	Solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. While being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the movie was how I could identify with the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. To see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. Even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even identify with Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities. A really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
Positive	Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />I had to do some research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with (well?), what she was afflicted with. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. She pulled it of flawlessly.<br /><br />Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could be interpreted as tender, and romantic? Well, they can be, when the right performers present them in the proper manner, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie. I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth, but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.<br /><br />I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for letting me express my opinion.
Positive	"Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and I think it was the ""no expectation"" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than I anticipated.<br /><br />The setting was interesting, strange but interesting. The storyline had gaps/jumps that I think throws the audience off a bit. There's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the ""romantic"" ambiance. BUT they all didn't matter.<br /><br />The chemistry between Emma and Luis was simply exquisite. There was some inexplicable strange chemistry that I couldn't resist; I fell in love with it and here I am, writing this review. The subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and I believe, that is the core of this movie.<br /><br />This movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. I had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things I didn't catch at first. I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but I hope YOU do."
Positive	"Well it was a nice surprise after all. its trailer did not predict a good film at all, it was even a bit misleading. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardonic and funny. Less real though, I do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for. One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was too corny, cliché and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not last past his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this. I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I do not see why she is the ""sex symbol"" of the year, I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine."
Positive	I love this movie, but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like. People who don't like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. As the opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And causes some mean fun to the whos in Whoville. Sicne we know that the whos love Christmas. While The Grinch does not like christmas. And even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrtor's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the mayor of whoville. Who doesn't like talking about the Grinch close to Christmas time.
Positive	I've always liked this John Frankenheimer film. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts. What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploitive thriller that shouldn't be forgotten.
Positive	"> Contrary to most reviews I've read, I didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.) The story was more unique, although I feel most people wanted to see the ""sex, drugs & rock and roll"" vices that the band kept alluding to.<br /><br />> As an American, I knew a few of the actors - Spall, Connelly & Rea. Surprised to find out ""Brian""/Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi's (<sp?) classic ""Romeo & Juliet"". Guess I'll have to rent that next.<br /><br />> ""THE FLAME STILL BURNS"" - My wife, who hails from Mexico, didn't follow the English/British language too well, missed some of the jokes (which I dutifully explained) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene. She loves the song so much now.<br /><br />> Funny that Amazon.com has the soundtrack for $30+usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50usd. Price non-withstanding, I first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since."
Positive	"This cool Marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman improves in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics.<br /><br />As you'd expect Spiderman does whatever a spider can. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he's not using web in combat, he punches and kicks as well. Spidey has his hands full as he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few. Look for Captain America in a cameo.<br /><br />Most of the levels are challenging, but some of them require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours. If you're a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you but don't expect long gameplay. Better luck in ""Spiderman 2."" My evaluation: 9 out of 10."
Positive	Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. It's a movie that breaths through amazing acting and a very interesting directing touch. In Jacknife both lovers of European and American cinema can find things to relate on. The screenplay is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is giving one of the greatest performances up to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero superbly making us feel his broken heart in each line, in each move. Robert De Niro makes us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time in one of the simplest but also most realistic performances in his career. Jacknife is never getting boring as it shows its heroes clear of any typical Hollywood's typical character elements. After the war none is a hero. Everybody is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. None can mend up his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that war creates. Simply magnificent movie.
Positive	This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.<br /><br />The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.
Positive	Faith and Mortality... viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind..<br /><br />Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is cryptic, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending..<br /><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith.. it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors..
Positive	envy is not as funny as i thought it would initially be, but after some of the reviews i read i found it to be much funnier than people was giving it props for, now true its not a gag a minute movie like zoolander or dodgeball, but ben stiller and jack black work well with each other and christopher walken is as great as ever, so the story is about jack black's character inventing a spray that makes dog pooh disappear, obviosly ben wants no part of it, but when the product makes jack black rich ben stiller starts to see the envy, its not great by all means and both ben stiller and jack black have funnier and better movies under their belt, but if your a fan of either i recommend this as its still a funny flick and i laughed my ass off quite a few times, as a big fan of ben stiller id have to say this is a lesser stiller but still great fun, give it a watch
Positive	"This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: B+"
Positive	"This is by far one of my favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. <br /><br />For example AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks , and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity ""problem"" and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend, who keep in mind gave him a ""guilt free pass"" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let's be realistic; most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a romantic story.<br /><br />Whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always Mr. Levenstein lends his ""perfectly natural"" eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie."
Positive	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!"". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him.<br /><br />But this is where the resemblance stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few. The magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script.<br /><br />I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and, without comparing it with animes that I liked more, but were from other genres, I have to say that I was very pleased."
Positive	"What a lovely heart warming television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed ..only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.Which all viewers hope will materialise. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the little girl's mum ,as she was as the nanny in"" Jack and Sarah"",worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; year tear jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as, always a delightful grandmother in this tender and magnificently acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is charming and a most convincing young actress. The film is based on a true story which makes it so touching.""Mermaid"" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in. ""Mermaid"" gives us all hope ,by realising that there a lot of lovely people in the world with lot's of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K."
Positive	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen. It really was a pleasant surprise. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery, this really pulls you into the story, you don't want to watch, but you can't turn yourself away. This is by far Verhoeven's best film (maybe second only to Robocop). True The Fourth Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked. This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends, a true whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition, compelling, controversial and thrilling. I even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br /> 8/10
Positive	"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink. (The bathtub, however is present.) This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it is because they were big in the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni who croons a love song in a sexy manner. Perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been restored for this version. It is truly beautiful and it stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive ""Lady Luck"" finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour. This is truly an epic of the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will love this."
Positive	*What I Like About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the wacky things that will happen to her from now on, and not only to her, but to her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you don't have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like only veeeery sophisticated comedy this isn't for you; if you like a funny, sometimes touching show with two hot chicks who can act in the lead (and none other than the fabulous 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), then what the hell are you waiting for? You're welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I Like About You (2002-2006): 8.
Positive	"""Pecker"" proves that Waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do. Over the years, the budget of Waters' films has increased considerably. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was amazed to see that Waters still has that ""trailer-park"" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a quite life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a New York art agent (the always watchable Lili Taylor), and his life changes for the worst. Once again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It is not among his best films, but there are some big belly laughs here (""Memama"" has the best lines in the film!). It is consistently clever and funny, and has that very ""queer"" sensibility that I have come to love in Warters' movies."
Positive	Now this is one of Big's Best, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a great stalwart cast, who ham the play up for all they're worth, especially Askey of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull. When the formula works it's very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is. But those damn treacherous fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays!<br /><br />Ultimately a nice harmless film, to welcome back to the TV screen as an old friend, but if you were expecting to be shivered out of your timbers you'll probably be very disappointed!
Positive	American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded.<br /><br />At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.<br /><br />Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.<br /><br />One of the best romance movies. 9/10
Positive	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the educational purpose, and the message behind that is the most important. It's not a sin to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it's not really a bad thing, either, but it is a problem. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they never watched this great movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message behind it all. It's about not taking chances when you're in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose out on your dreams, but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear message behind it: JUST SAY NO!
Positive	"well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. with the rare exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films generally aren't ""deep"", but they are often entertaining enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would. Uma Thurman is just so grand, and i love her portrayals. I like Luke Wilson too, and Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot. Never taking itself seriously, the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique, nor does it go where no one has gone before.... it's a nice rent though and probably an OK date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. It's escapist fun and there's nothing wrong with that. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. Not all of them take being ""dumped"" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist."
Positive	"Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a ""Dead Poets Society"" more than a ""Matilda"". It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money."
Positive	"2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This film had everything in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The acting was tip top of any independant film. Jeremy Earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show. His lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next emergance of a young Denzel Washington when the line ""My bus!! It's.... Gone"" That was the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis bond. Through thick( being held up at knife point) and thin( Nathan giving Tony tips on women) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer Hollywood."
Positive	I loved the movie, but like everyone said, there were some bits that weren't developed enough. I thought personally that the girls were very vapid before they landed in prison; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still...I felt like they lacked that bond that best friends are supposed to have. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very awkward-looking.<br /><br />Then, there are some parts that were very ambiguous. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' character didn't do it, but I can see how that could be confusing. Also, why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.<br /><br />Apart from that, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes took the blame; she's a GREAT actress.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure...
Positive	I love this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It does get better with every viewing. I agree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's gritty and brutally realistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself doing commentary as I watched it. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't disagree more. He is brilliant as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7 old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as distant neighbor called grandma. Also a star is the stark Montana prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is real! It even has a terrificly perfect music score and a great script. Once you see Heartland, you'll never forget it. It deserves all the 10s it gets here.
Positive	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are on target, it's moving, funny, sad, and yes, a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act. Well worth your time.
Positive	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but became a fan very quickly. It was a cop show unlike any other: visually different in its use of hand-held cameras, taking the viewer everywhere, with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities, and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department, including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is as good as a made-for-television film can be. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer. In addition, the cast members who left the force and those who died, also manage to have their place in the film. The intensity and fire that marked the series return, and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series. All in all, a terrific TV movie.<br /><br />Vote: 9
Positive	"The film maybe goes a little far, but if you love the show it's what you expect. It's not a bad movie; it's actually pretty good. If you don't like the show, don't see the movie. It starts off a little slow maybe, but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny. There are even a few ""heart-wrenching"" scenes toward the end. After all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you. Also Jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience. He's got a pretty good point. We care so much about the private details of celebrities lives, so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national TV, too. If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind at all, we'd eat it up. Do we not like his guest doing this just because they're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a ""Leave it to Beaver"" world?"
Positive	One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a bad day. The story is based around a sad event and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is drip fed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the performances make sense. All the characters were OK and Wil Smith did another good day at the office.<br /><br />There are no doubt a lot of moral questions to be asked but if you just accept and buy into his agony then it is easier to accept what he has chosen to do. Whether you agree or disagree is irrelevant. The journey it takes you on is interesting enough, if not overwhelming.<br /><br />A good enough film that unfortunately leaves you a little sad at the end. I would recommend this film if you like the sort where you have to think and not just watch explosions and fights.
Positive	"Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie.<br /><br />The only difference is that their trip is ""somewhere"" between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have. Besides playing roles they have...er...perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet).<br /><br />The reason I liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with ""what it might be like"" instead of ""what was."" Without spoiling the movie, I can't give you anymore information about this (I guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars."
Positive	"This interesting Giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.<br /><br />Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little slow, but all in all, no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.<br /><br />This film is a German-Italian coproduction, but it was released in Germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title ""Horror House"". At least the murder scenes, which will satisfy every gorehound, are fully intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. But the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.<br /><br />A convincing Giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is highly recommended to Giallo fans and slightly superior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
Positive	To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
Positive	Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so perfect and natural, the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed to perfection. It says a lot for the power of the performances, and the strength of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book at least a dozen times, and watched the movie almost as many times, and continue to be mesmerized by both. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others.
Positive	"It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent, stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves. They should make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"".<br /><br />It's a perfect, complete version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece Shakespeare would have been proud of. They've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.<br /><br />The cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses. Branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. His sharp, irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. Every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. Branagh's version of ""Hamlet"" is among the ten best motion pictures ever."
Positive	I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so I have decided to write my own. I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. First of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. It is worth watching. The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. The movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life?
Positive	My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle. He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him. I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie. On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me obtain this movie? Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
Positive	Plato's run is an entertaining b movie with Gary Busey.it is a fairly unknown film so one i saw it at a car boot i thought this looks entertaining i was right to.Gary Busey plays Plato smith a tough mercenary who is framed for the assassination of a powerful Cuban crime lord now on the run Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). what i liked about Plato's run was the way the film never got boring the plot may have been done before but it was still good the acting was fun to watch and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax Gary Busey makes a good hero ironic since he normally plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he cant even act well to finish it of Plato's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image films and i give it 7 out of 10
Positive	Well, I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best film. The plot, the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a crime lord. After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer. Due to this, he became wanted by the police. Later on, Salina (Brigitte Lin), who was the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on, Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen, defeating them one by one. At the last scene, Chan was seen punching the crime lord. Lastly, this is the best action and comedy movie. Everyone should watch it. Highly recommended.
Positive	The first von Trier movie i've ever seen was breaking the waves. Sure a nice movie but it definitely stands in the shadow of europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxues train. Because of his job, he travels all through an almost totally destroyed germany, meeting with the killing of traitors, and hunt for former nazi party members. The society is suffering from corruption. His uncle has narrowed his conciousness by focussing on the job he has also as a purser on the train. By coincidence the main character get involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' they put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The atmosphere is astounding. The viewer is taken from scene to scene by a man attempting to put the viewer under hypnosis and then counting to wake you up in a new scene. Just when you think you've seen a lot!!!!!!! europe!!
Positive	Remember the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and i can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. And i remember almost every scene that was in the add. I've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them. It's one that when its on its hard to shut off. All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category. It has enough action and laughs to sustain it. check it out if you dare!
Positive	But the fun is in the journey.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way.<br /><br />Great date movie, great movie for a happy cry...
Positive	I have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore I loved how this move was unlike Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close.<br /><br />I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers chanting that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end... Gojoe has the action, story and visuals to mesmerize any viewer. I strongly believe that with some skillful editing it can be sold in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
Positive	I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I own a copy of this film on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas Eve. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghost story.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and moving. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one creepier than the last. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends shivers down my spine every year. And what a supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is in top form as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others--but I may be mistaken, as it's been several years since I read it. Regardless, this is a terrific Christmas classic.
Positive	"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre. One can feel, moreover, the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for its next appearance."
Positive	"I generally find Loretta Young hard to take, too concerned with her looks and too ladylike in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-esteem patsy who puts up with entirely too much bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy, she's direct and honest and irresistible. It's an odd little movie, played mostly in a one-room shack in a Hooverville, unusually up-front about the Depression yet romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a blustery, hard-to-take ""regular guy"" who would be an awful chauvinist and bully by today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and almost makes him appealing. There's good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never got as far as she should have), and Jo Swerling's screenplay is modest and efficient. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always liked to dramatize true love in lyrical close-up, and Young. You sort of want to slap her and tell her character to wise up, she's too good for this guy, but she's so dewy and persuasive, you contentedly watch their story play out to a satisfying conclusion."
Positive	I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and at the time it shocked me. I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending. No matter how good...bad you are. There is no ending of a chapter to begin another.
Positive	Being a huge fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this film greatly exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances, but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on. Moon Child has just the right amount of humour, action, romance and serious, heart-wrenching moments. I can't say that I've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with, you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde.
Positive	Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a good start. This film is a well acted entertaining suspense<br /><br />with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more<br /><br />in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater. Esther<br /><br />looks great and if she wanted to, probably could have gone on to<br /><br />do more and better films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />pretty much gave up working for marriage. Either way she is so<br /><br />likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role<br /><br />outside of the 'swimming musical'. Universal was fabulous for<br /><br />making films with former MGM stars after that studio began<br /><br />dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill. Stars<br /><br />like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others got to make quality first<br /><br />rate films at Universal as they obviously still had drawing power at<br /><br />the box office. I wish Esther had made more but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the more special.
Positive	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be overjoyed. That woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress. That's a tough combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is : ""use him more"".<br /><br />now about the movie: I watched it in one of my graveyard shift. I don't recommend that to anyone. It's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming. I'm not gonna say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this is spoilment enough.<br /><br />now i'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie. I love the dark mystic story, the actors did a good job & i love the directors (natali) work in the past. There's not a big audience for this kind of thing, that's also pretty risky. you know what, i'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this. Then again, 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement."
Positive	"Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end. Not a laugh riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated humor. What a goldmine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS dated. You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.<br /><br />A classic movie that is really a treasure."
Positive	One of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade. Throughout the five hours, ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, brilliant. At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was magnificent, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that restore one's faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves.
Positive	"If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the real, non-caricature, ""Real American"" side of America then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you've seen before.<br /><br />This film is ""unreal"", a facile term if ever there was one, but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera, and the completely apparent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.<br /><br />This film is a symphony, crafted as well as Beethovens 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii, tugging deeply on human emotion in Santa Cruz and finishing with uproar, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats, again in Hawaii.<br /><br />Like classical music; like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you like, but it's worth it. Trust me."
Positive	Savaged when it came out, this film now looks handsome and sounds great. A feast of intelligent thoughtful acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook,and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and show off- his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect, and Graham Greene's script condenses Shaw without sacrificing complexity.The piece has the look of a made for TV movie, and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes cannot resist dumbing down. What would Mel Gibson have made of the Maid? Many drooling shots of her on the rack probably, then crisping up on the BBQ as the flames take hold. Preminger does none of this. The burning is shown mainly through a guilt-stricken reaction. There are a few weak performances, but not enough to cause any serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and was not expecting to watch it through, but I was gripped . In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected resonance.
Positive	I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. He's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. The real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. It's the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.
Positive	"This movie didn't really surprise me, as such, it just got better and better. I thought: ""Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well...we'll see how he does..."" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I appreciate Colombo. Even though I was never a big fan of the show, I've always liked watching Peter Falk. <br /><br />The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played off of each other so well that I practically felt giddy with enjoyment! ...And I hadn't even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so well done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:""Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to watch it..."" ...and I ended up just loving it!"
Positive	I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. I still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. This film, however, proved what an interesting actor he could be. He did not get enough roles like this during his long career. This is his best performance. He is totally believable in a truly villainous role. From what I have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. He basically would just do what MGM gave him. This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this film is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. The last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. This film is definitely worth a look.
Positive	"are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simple lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some stunning ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is splendid. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this pleasant film. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this film seems to have been written just for her: plucky young woman succeeds over misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship are very well done. Not a great Picford film, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love interest, and is good as the strapping island lad. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village warning bells are rung. Very effective."
Positive	"All of the reviews here about how much ZP lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point.<br /><br />Let's be honest. This is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It is a movie meant to be watched while your are H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.<br /><br />Find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point. You can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.<br /><br />Until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which I am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about.<br /><br />If you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful re-working of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene,"" ""Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up."""
Positive	This film really deserves more recognition than its getting. It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. The film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. This film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. It is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. It features an arrangement of great characters, actors and development although is fair to say I had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. ALl in all 8/10 Great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way) so it loses some points for that.
Positive	When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex. While he has racist views, he's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie should have gotten more notoriety. However it's on DVD and worth the money.<br /><br />Rayvyn
Positive	For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended.<br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something may happen. And it happened! How she longed to be there, in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman<br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the melancholy of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />In both movies, from great directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so intense, yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts. That leaves you with a great after-taste, sniffing it intensely without biting it.
Positive	As I said in my comment about the first part: These two movies are better than most Science Fiction Fans confess.<br /><br />The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story heats up, carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It is thrilling Science Fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects (even though those tend to repeat themselves, to say the least :-) ).<br /><br />I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board. Instead, we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well-chosen...<br /><br />So thumbs down for the productions of 1980, but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978.
Positive	I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder.<br /><br />Opened at #4 behind...<br /><br />#1-Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which I have seen, awesome movie but 3rd week out, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say).<br /><br />#3-The Simpsons Movie, which I have seen, okay movie but 4th week out, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion).<br /><br />#4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn, but that's been our for 3 weeks).<br /><br />Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Awesome movie, go see it!
Positive	Emma is a true romance. If you love the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades. She shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the hero. how shocked are you? I never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck! What the right role can do for you! He looks so good as the sensible, regal Mr. K, that i am literally looking at him in a new light. He makes and excellent romantic lead. The charm and character that he brings to his role is wonderful!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a good cast. A good movie. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, see this movie, along with Pride and Prejudice - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, buy the books. It enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary
Positive	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a good feature! I was right! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is great story, great characters and great animation. My favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died laughing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the worst Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could hate a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty good films! Good job PIXAR!
Positive	"Ok, at the beginning it looked like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing."
Positive	Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
Positive	"This film is very interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems Glover hit the nail on the head with what he claims to he wants to accomplish. I for one can relate to the outrage that the filmmaker clearly expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center, and the things that we as a culture are supposed to not ""think"" about due to corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is both clear in its visceral aggressiveness and beautiful in its poetic potency. I am glad I saw this film and it is even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is fine! EVERYTHING IS FINE. See that also. People that dismiss this film as ""thoughtless"" or ""pretentious"" are really missing the boat. This is an intelligent films. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also very wroth while. The way you get in to his mindset is really something. You will have an experience!"
Positive	"This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose.<br /><br />I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur gets to Susan's Dad's place to the bit with the moose, you pretty much laugh the whole time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it'd be like. They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.<br /><br />The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he handled Arthur were all equally hilarious. It's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow."
Positive	In a word...amazing.<br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a heart-wrenching, emotional and intelligent movie without any visible flaws. I was haunted by it after watching it. It lingered on my mind for so long; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so real.<br /><br />This is truly a masterpiece that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story. Here, no one country is depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting. Everything about the movie was amazing...and the acting just took my breath away. All were perfectly cast.<br /><br />If you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie...look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with all my heart. AMAZING cannot describe how excellent it is.
Positive	I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a ride! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a Crew! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City, to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage. And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on the trip of his life; and they touched many, many lives. By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research, this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
Positive	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had seen CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it caught my eye, and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, right off the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) and I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great. You've got to love the satire of rap groups (obviously NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube), and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved, as it was overshadowed by CB4 during their releases, but in my opinion is a much better film. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time. If you aren't into or don't like 'rap', you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
Positive	"In this film we have the fabulous opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film even goes back to before Simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /><br />Quite true to the first film, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A bundle of surprises and hilarity await for you!<br /><br />While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument of what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very fair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... It starts with Timon's first home...<br /><br />For anyone with a good sense of humour who liked the first films of just about any age, enjoy ""Lion King 1/2""! :-)"
Positive	"I remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happens next. I was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. . Two friends are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A ""Lets not go to class today."" And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So kid B skips and kid A goes to class. When he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. They were going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid A, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes looking for the teacher. When he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I suggest everyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time."
Positive	"Stylishly directed, picturesquely photographed and brilliantly acted  Crosby's interpretation seems exactly right, Hardwicke has his best role ever, while Bendix is a treat too  this Yankee's appeal is universal and irresistible.<br /><br />One of the principal joys of the movie, of course, are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is in fine voice. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing heartily as he dances merrily with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also a treat to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a lovely voice that more than matches her ravishing looksand she looks very fetching indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett gets the most out of his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present every fabulous scene as effectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment delight from start to finish."
Positive	"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />""Panic in the Streets"" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Pânico nas Ruas"" (""Panic in the Streets"")"
Positive	I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In that film, the setting takes place in China's mountains, the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension!! Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where beings fly freely, and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the ultra cool Moon Orb.<br /><br />While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romance aspect is there, although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching. In the beginning, I like how she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia's very appealing to the eye??<br /><br />In truth, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.
Positive	"I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry.She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for ""troubled girls"", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her playing ""their song"" on the piano that is acted perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A truly sweet romance."
Positive	As someone who was born to a German mother and English father (who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp) I come from unique position. One of having to deal with the various Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of WW2 on the other. This miniseries cannot delve into every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can Hitler's state of mind. In this the series does quite well. Carlyle is very good as is O'Toole, I would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party Because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career. What was going through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people research the subject more. It might also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to continue in power.
Positive	I truly enjoyed the movie, however, I did not realize that Little Richard had so many things going on in his life. First of all I was not aware of Lucille. There is very little (hardly any) mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of females in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall the movie was great. I also did not like Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he is a good actor but I feel that the part of should have went to a different actor. Visually he did not remind me of Little Richard. I also was totally unaware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the movie he was pictured as a sexual addict. In todays time he would be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I don't want to ruin the movie for someone that has not seen the movie however there were several things about the movie that I feel should not have been a part of the final cut.
Positive	"My family goes back to New Orleans late 1600's early 1700's and in watching the movie I knew it was a history my grand-parents never talked about, but we knew it existed. I have cousins obviously black aka African Americans and others who can ""pass"" as white and chose not to. It's a hard history to watch when you realize that it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all a part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it makes me want to kick the 'arse' of my great grandfathers who owned those plantations and wonder in awe of how my great grandmothers of African heritage lived under that oppressive and yet aristocratic existence...And at the same time had I not come out of that history, I probably wouldn't be the successful business woman I am today living successfully in a fairly integrated world. The acting was both excellent and fair depending upon the actor, but it is a movie that NEEDED to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself, why is she 'symbolically' writing about my family and I'm not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza"
Positive	"We taped this when it aired on TV back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, for it quickly became one of our family favorites. The kids are now teens and must have seen it a ba-zillion times, yet they still watch it religiously with friends. It's timeless appeal reaches across all ages groups--similar to ""Grease.""<br /><br />Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander delightful and wonderfully light on his feet. I've noticed other commentators on this site are pretty rough on him, but our family gives him top ratings. (We loved his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies us with comedic relief and wonderful musical numbers. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just flat steals the show. Probably our favorite character in the entire movie.<br /><br />The one disappointment was Chynna Philip's performance of Kim. Part of that has to do with the writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating that, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Or never cast her to begin with.<br /><br />Overall, though, the picture is delightful and I highly recommend it for families of all ages."
Positive	I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways, and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe, perhaps some abuse, or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its' own. This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, without going completely over the edge - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, racoons emerging from holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child's birthday party gone seriously wrong. Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you'll never forget it, but very disturbing.
Positive	"""This Man's Navy"" is, as other comments have indicated, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone. However, the first half of the movie is all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Only then does the second film start. The second film is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, guys get killed and much damage is caused. The look is fairly gritty and realistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle. And the Japs are shooting like mad. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh, so leisurely. This is a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a feel-good WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war."
Positive	A fabulous film. With everything you could want in a film. Huge battle scenes and lots of other action. Suspense, and a romantic love story. <br /><br />Kind of like an old swashbuckler film. Totally entertaining from start to finish. <br /><br />The editing was fast and you are never bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household. The actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent. The costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative. The special effects are amazing too.<br /><br />Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at. He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom. <br /><br />John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is. He is one of the great actors of our time.<br /><br />And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady, even doing an English accent with remarkable success. <br /><br />I found out that the film has won numerous awards, and i can see why.<br /><br />All in all this is an amazing Independent film. See it for sure. <br /><br />I highly recommend it. And give it a TEN +!!!
Positive	"What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the USA.<br /><br />Main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like ""polymer"" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like ""long chain molecules"" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.<br /><br />The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major USA cinema.......it's a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated English actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have approved of.<br /><br />Everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.<br /><br />It's wonderful."
Positive	"I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I do think she played her role well, even if the script was not appropriate. There were good Romanian actors around, they just didn't have complex roles. I applaud Puya's entering the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor.<br /><br />The wife loved the movie, though, and I think there might have been chords being played and to which I had no ear for. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it failed miserably. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a boring, uninteresting plot.<br /><br />I have no idea why it got all those BAFTA awards. In my book, it should have gotten the ""Better luck next time"" award. (bafta=good luck in Romanian)."
Positive	How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free? Most of us, I suspect. Shall we dance? is not a movie about dancing. It is about learning about ourselves, recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy. he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons. He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule. He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family.<br /><br />There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes.<br /><br />The ending is not a fairytale, but it leaves the viewer feeling good.<br /><br />This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better. It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see.
Positive	"Outragously entertaining period piece set in the 30s, it is a spin on the classic cliffhanger series, as much as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", only done on a low budget and much campier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes laces liberal amount of gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfectly cast hero and the gorgeous Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona tagging on to our hero on a goldhunt in the non-existent latin american country of Hidalgo. Best line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug: ""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute delight. Expect a little ""Raiders.."", a dash of ""Batman"", a little ""The Lost World"", a little ""Lost Horizons"" and a whole lot of campiness and you'll get it just right. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the campy use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A prime candidate for DVD release, it is certainly overdue. An unmissable treat for the whole family. 9/10"
Positive	Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect. There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes forward into history. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous. Definitely worth seeing again.
Positive	"Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present and future collide.<br /><br />This is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show, dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other, a friendly and tiny little E.T. who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This picture does show off a little imagination, if nothing else.<br /><br />Very nice music by Richard Band, engaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen, Randall William Cook, and Peter Kuran, and, importantly, a likable family are key assets. It generates a sense of child-like amazement; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />I found it hard to resist; it's a short and sweet (80 minutes) diversion, and a decent credit for director John ""Bud"" Cardos (of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" fame) and executive producer Charles Band.<br /><br />7/10"
Positive	Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a lot of fun. A few tech errors aside, it was a great experience. I loved the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is a lot of heart in this movie, a lot of wit to. I got a chance to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, and they seemed real nice. All in all the whole movie was just a positive experience, and one I'd definitely recommend. The story was entertaining and cool, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I could really understand his problems because of it. The movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are really well written to, they are realistic. I know people like these, I only wish Imy friends and I could sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just real cool, I wish there were more films out there like it.<br /><br />- Jayden
Positive	Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a freshness about it that can be attributed to the fantastic chemistry between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer could be forgiven for believing that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their incredible displays of pure affection towards one another.<br /><br />The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' however for anyone that enjoys watching a film that takes you beyond the living room into a world where the characters seem truly alive - A Star is Born is well worth the hiring price.<br /><br />With its incredible soundtrack, flawless acting and touching reality in regards to human emotions and the true frailty of life; A Star is Born is a film that draws you into the world of Esther Hoffman & the love of her life John Norman Howard.<br /><br />A film for anyone that sees the beauty in real love - the kind that keeps you devoted to a person even as they break your heart...
Positive	"Ultra-grim crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's an engaging, flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately. This is grim, nasty stuff, which is why I'm so partial to it, and I applaud its downbeat vibe. It's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery."
Positive	"This sweeping drama has it all: top notch acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"" because both movies take place in historical Scotland. Even though I love Braveheart, I think this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should have been nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most evil, despicable, characters in film history (he was nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another dislikeable character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who, inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is all about; honor of the common man versus corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to all. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a exciting plot. One of my favorite films."
Positive	"William H. Macy is at his most sympathetic and compelling here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Treads much of the same territory as TV's ""The Sopranos"" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. This is probably his best role since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland is at his creepy best as the domineering father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly riveting dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find abhorrent) is compelling as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. All of this is punctuated by a moving score and crisp pace that lead up to a predictable but still powerful climax and meaningful and touching aftermath. This film deserved a much wider release, as I suspect it would have connected with audiences."
Positive	A brilliant chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be a pretty bad angle on a story. So, there is more. There is the fact that the chess player is also completely alienated from the world because of his brilliance at the game and the fact there is some history haunting the player.<br /><br />This film steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite nicely. It's easy to grow attached to the two main characters and easy to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is very good too and creates a nice tension setting.<br /><br />I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks nice and believable. All in all, most of the film goes down very easily. It is also forgotten again very easily though. So it's nice to watch but nothing more than that.<br /><br />7 out of 10 chess players caught between a rook and a hard place
Positive	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So my only gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was superb with I think Prunella scales excellent as Miss Bates but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. The language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days!! So once again thank you BBC for another quality piece of television. I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far superior. An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD!!!
Positive	"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble: parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't. Slowly, everyone grows up and goes away. THAT precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long sequence with Scott Baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and I didn't much care for an edit late in the film that segues clumsily from a death to a wedding. But these are nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond. And Jodie's face at the ending speaks volumes. If viewers do get choked up at the end, the movie has earned this. It doesn't pander for tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand. *** from ****"
Positive	Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special.
Positive	"I consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works, for he provides the viewers with absolutely unique motion pictures with typical ""Lynch-elements."" Having seen most of his works, I naively thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could have never imagined under the name of David Lynch. Still, after my recovery from the first shock, I started to contemplate about this extremely primitive main character, and I drew the conclusion that all the absurdities, cruelty, brutality and disgust presented here are mirroring bits from reality, being emphasized by distorting it. There are things in our lives we hardly ever emphasize, for they are either disgusting or horrible, however, they are surrounding us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits and pieces. This is not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes laugh out of a strange, perverted sense of humor, this is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity. Take it as it is, you don't have to like it. It just exists. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements typical to Lynch as well. I recommend it for tolerant people!!!"
Positive	"In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.<br /><br />""Reign Over Me"" is a good drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Reine Sobre Mim"" (""Reign Over Me"")"
Positive	And I don't say it in a bad way.<br /><br />I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7. For me and my cousins it was magical, beautiful and scary at the same time. When we left the theatre, Michael was our best friend even though we knew he had no idea about it.<br /><br />Over the years, I saw this movie being aired a few times but I always changed the channel. Even seeing a few seconds of it would bring back that feeling of magic and warm my heart. And I liked it that way.<br /><br />So I've only seen this movie once and I believe it was a good decision not to watch it again. If I saw it today, I know I couldn't help but criticise MJ's acting, the plot (if there was one) and this and that. For me this is a childhood memory, so my feelings towards it are those of a child from 20 years ago.<br /><br />I see my adult self intervenes in my rating and gives it an 8 for the memories and wonderful music. For that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely worthy of a 10.
Positive	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. I rated this a 9. Lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I recommend it highly.(***)
Positive	"THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since ""There's Something About Mary"" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. A true winner and an instant classic; the funniest film of the year."
Positive	"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and deep rituals are what gives this film it's frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Good silent drama. ****"
Positive	"I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting it's strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was ""what the hells' wrong with the sound?""-Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing. Words echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there's no Shakespeare here!,just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was, the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story,but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included). All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after,then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates,using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing. There was something honest about it. I thought if they'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better, which i'm sure they considered daily,but, they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what independent film-making is all about.The word ""Indy"", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's funny!"
Positive	"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was a fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles. Here, she's a pretty young ingenue playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a live-in situation; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I said the movie is too short. Nevertheless, I recommend it."
Positive	All Dogs Go To Heaven is on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies films. Both were dark and pretty sinister, but at the same time the most mesmerising experience a child can have. This was one of my favourite films as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at the tender age of about five or six, I'll admit... I had a crush on a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells the dark story of lovable cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story starts with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club to do some gambling. Of course, as a child, I didn't understand the concept of this film. I loved the songs and the animation but as I've got older I do begin to wonder why I wasn't disturbed by this film as a youngster. It deals with pretty adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison but in a world of goody-goody Disney films, it's something every child should watch once. <br /><br />Yes, there's some sort of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and the hell scenes scare me more now that when I was little, but it delivers such a poignant message that should not be ignored by parents!
Positive	The 1960's TV series Bewitched owes it's idea from this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were cast together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as that one but Novak is just as captivating.<br /><br />This was Jack Lemmons 10th movie and he is good in support here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in The Music Man. The cast is very solid.<br /><br />This movie has a late 1950's New York City feel & a cat that is as hexing as any feline in any movie. It is well worth watching as it is a love story with all the emotion of any, & a little magic too boot.<br /><br />It is not Vertigo but I think because it followed that movie, viewers then did not rate it as good as it deserved - sure am glad that William Asher saw it, so that the 1960's series got created. I am not so glad about what Will Ferrell did to it on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
Positive	I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br /><br />Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeemable friends who are just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives.<br /><br />I went in thinking this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yea, it's pretty over the top (c'mon, it's a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), but it's very smartly done.<br /><br />In the end, you're really pulling for this guy to get laid, which says a lot about the movie because honestly, did you really care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not?
Positive	Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be disappointed by the film because I'd heard that it did not get great reviews. However, I left the cinema completely in awe of how good Vanilla Sky is.<br /><br />There was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is believable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are tear-jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).<br /><br />The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending. However, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames.<br /><br />The film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout. This isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second.<br /><br />I usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film I just watch. But Vanilla Sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films.
Positive	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy provides fitting closure for this entertaining series of samuraisploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is pretty much the same, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu serving as the producer, apart from the titular antihero.<br /><br />Hanzo uncovers a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he's not put off by the fact she's a ghost, so he proceeds to rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also doubletime as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, and generally, it's business as usual.<br /><br />Significantly less convoluted and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the finest in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthwhile on its own merits. Complete with trademark training sequences, the obligatory rape, swordfights, and a mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately satisfy the fans.
Positive	This was one of the best shows ever made for TV. Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Compulsive viewing. I was lucky I saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it at least was on at a regular time every week. My girlfriend and I got hooked from the trailer in, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />After the pilot, we knew this was something special. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />Great casting, superb acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better even than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned in an amazing performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was at her best too since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course, as the Sheriff's long suffering sidekick.<br /><br />Yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which I presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. That made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
Positive	"The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand. It dispels many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is. This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word ""vagina"" in the dialogue.<br /><br />It is cute how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely animated character way with no defining features as was the way of the day. Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either. Max Fleischer was a bit of a card and did this with many of the Betty Boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.<br /><br />There is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. In fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation.<br /><br />This title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are Bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. This is one of those ""keepers"" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity."
Positive	"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTATION wonderfully synthesizes Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a little ""rough"" in its technical execution but it's beautiful none the less, and very evocative in terms of giving a unique ""sense of place"" to each of the scenes. Beyond the absolute uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely outstanding voice acting - acting that's FAR superior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might not be the most ""technically proficient"" animation it superbly captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting while at once not forgetting to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional ""fantasy"" motif to outright abstraction, but the transition to abstracted settings is always motivated by the narrative and contributes greatly to the themes of the film. If you're a person who has to have extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might not like this movie but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is a must see."
Positive	The movie concerns about Philip(Leslie Howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student .He falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called Mildred(Bette Davis).She leaves him ,engaging with others(Alan Hale,Reginald Denny).Meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(Kay Johnson,Frances Dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.<br /><br />Easily the best and first of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance ,absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale.Davis rose the stardom with her performance.Her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting . Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance.He was an awesome actor(Gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during WWII. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio is entirely convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey . The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. Rating : Very good but a little bit dated.
Positive	Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. The story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off.
Positive	"Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction. Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called ""chapters"" or ""episodes."" Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week. The serial would end with a cliffhanger, as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escape.<br /><br />The audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again. Serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century, a typical Saturday at the movies included a chapter of at least one serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films.<br /><br />The golden age for serials was 1936-1945. This was one of the best of the era.<br /><br />Zorro has been seen in many films, but Reed Hadley (""Racket Squad"", The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role.<br /><br />The action is constant, and we are led chapter by chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro triumphs, as he always does."
Positive	"I've read a few of the reviews and I'm kinda sad that a lot of the Story seems glossed over. Its easy to do because its not a Book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does, at least for a recovering ""F@g-Hag"" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. I mean, the man really can't get much more pale! Though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.<br /><br />If you need decrepit, there are a few SKing movies you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. And, as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. But I'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />I may be easy to please, but I enjoyed it. A nice story pretty well put together- by Canadians, quelle surprise. Just toed the line of the 'Movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, GREATLY Appreciated. And it was rather cleverly portrayed."
Positive	"I enjoyed Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. A lot of people complain about the ""confusing"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""Nemesis 2: Nebula"" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie."
Positive	Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action.<br /><br />Some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just talking. Don't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog.<br /><br />A PG-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven. But surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller.<br /><br />This movies strongest point is its cast. This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills. If they didn't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later. Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X-men 2.<br /><br />The pacing in this film was great. Just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you. Luckily this isn't a long movie and doesn't feel like it either. Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan.<br /><br />Here is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578<br /><br />I recommend. Not too long and not too shabby.<br /><br />8/10
Positive	"I watched this film sort of by accident, having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is in a whole other league. I bet this is one of Tarantino's favourites. There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I've never seen anything like before. Heston casually getting into bed with the ""furniture"" while discussing something else completely unrelated! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor. Ok maybe that's been done since - but there aren't many films that are so consistently original like this. And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever, or what? Luckily, I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare. Then I watched it again, and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile. A very nice script - and some great sets too. Just when you thought you'd seen everything . . ."
Positive	"This gripping tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and crisper sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Luckily even missing a word here and there won't spoil the fun: the primary actors are ideally cast. Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile, a go-for-broke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-ish women imaginable; her acting rivals her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them!) Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well. The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have plenty of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a wild yet satisfying two-hour denouement. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before.)"
Positive	This really is a great movie. Some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their best ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He adds to this movie, he doesn't detract from it. He has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorites list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I felt a need to stand up for him.
Positive	i wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass i tagged along only for the sake of seeing eva longoria and laughing at jason biggs antics.<br /><br />overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much. this was like a hybrid of how to lose a guy in 10 days and just like heaven. a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess. the movie was quite short though (around 85 min.) but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some character development and have a decent happy ending. the whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was a interesting plot to follow. eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially jason biggs) kept the laughs coming at a smooth pace.<br /><br />overall i liked the movie only because it had a good amount of laughs to keep me going otherwise i would have given this movie a lower rating. hey its a chick flick and i'm reviewing this movie from a guy's persepctive alright, it would be more of a fair fight if females reviewied this movie and gave there thoughts about it.
Positive	Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western: Man With The Gun. Tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in, when a town needs someone to save itself; he is the one who is brought in to do it. Tollinger's latest gig comes by as an accident: strolling into town looking for his former fling, he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster. But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger, as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing (suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original). <br /><br />Man With The Gun starts off as an average western tough-guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses. What starts off as forgettable and run-of-the-mill ends up dark and character-centered. The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable. Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances, Mitchum still has his classic and effective tough-guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action-packed, meaningful, and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park. Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth one's time.
Positive	If you came into the film with expectations, throw them away now, because no amount of hype will do this film justice.<br /><br />To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal. It's a spy thriller, has elements of noir, bits and pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative, mind-bending plot twists, and gorgeous cinematography.<br /><br />A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative, both in good and bad ways, of other movies. But as they say, every story cribs from Shakespeare, so once you can get past that, you're in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points, and while the set never becomes unbelievable, there are portions (read: the elevator) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. Don't misconstrue that to mean it's on the same level as cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies, though, because this is on a much higher level.<br /><br />If you're looking for action, you should turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience, by all means, DO IT NOW! Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it!
Positive	Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will either really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. But its based on a comic strip...what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played. She has the best one liners I've heard! Madonna fans would love it! One of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us. It's a film that will leave you smiling at the end.
Positive	"this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around.<br /><br /> Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite sweet)<br /><br /> even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still easy to follow along, but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it is really just that great.<br /><br /> this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy... ""So say good night to the BAD guy"""
Positive	Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People.<br /><br />Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. Plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment.
Positive	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a different way this time. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of ""surprises"" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. It's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. I really like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes ""Missed me"". I also like when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."
Positive	"Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. Both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or R-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. For example of the adult level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, that of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact I would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's ""Vern"" character). I had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie."
Positive	"When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as ""The King of Masks,"" becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate.<br /><br />His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's.<br /><br />He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, ""General,"" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child.<br /><br />His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupifying tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man.<br /><br />There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, and the culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe. Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars."
Positive	I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite remarkable film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, let the story unfold as it happens. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they keep themselves in the background and instead try to focus attention on the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. As a film, it is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we get to see what 'embedded' journalism should really be. What we get to see is a remarkable account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a democratically elected leader... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds.<br /><br />
Positive	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, stink. This also suffers, in large part, from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection. The sets look phony.<br /><br />There are two great strengths in this show, however: although the dialogue readings limp, the visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for ROSE HOBART, in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her: credit Melford's stylish visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (although stagy) performance help repair some of the damage to the earth-bound sections of this movie.<br /><br />However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great, from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to 'the Hot Place'. H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect.<br /><br />So we have here a flawed but very interesting version. I think that Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the watered-down musical remake. But I still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance.
Positive	"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy, and a frequently hilarious one. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy, because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous. As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer, the only possible outcome is comedy.<br /><br />What makes Offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp."
Positive	"Oh man, why? ""Six Degrees"" is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone. If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />When I first heard of this show, it didn't caught my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then, i saw some episodes... and loved it! First of all, the characters. They are all well-written and different from each other. There's a alcohol addicted, a woman whose fiancée cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother and so on... Unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in casualties, like in our daily routines. Great! My favourite ones are Mae, Carlos and Whitney.<br /><br />Then, the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, from ""Hostel"", shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton. The other ones give great performances too, specially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney.<br /><br />Well when i came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, i couldn't believe that it got cancelled. Seriously, i can't understand the low ratings.<br /><br />It's too bad it didn't have more than one season. It would really be a good show to follow!"
Positive	This is the best made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a huge Silverstone fan? Partially, but even without her, I'd still see it. I'm a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a great entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's top five character creations. Totally memorable - like she really exists. I'd have her on my side, too, if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete confidence in everything she does. Seems sweet, honest, nice...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a rebel once again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than vigilante-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still cool as a nerd. Check this out soon, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't...
Positive	This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~
Positive	"""The Last Big Thing"" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best...<br /><br />Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words!<br /><br />"
Positive	"""Soylent Green"" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for Joseph Cotton (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes""). THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity! No fancy space-ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet."
Positive	This game is fun and it has a plot that you could actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well he seems to have turned over a new leaf. Venom also does not seem to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey will unravel the mystery. The fighting is basic, not to hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are rather fun. You get to collect comics, you run out of web and it is somewhat fun traversing the city. However, that is also a weak point. The swinging is not all that great as all you do is hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attachés his webs to the sky. You also do not have much maneuverability web-slinging either especially compared to a say Spider-man 2 movie video game. Still, it makes up for the rather bad swinging with the other elements especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for one wild action packed ride.
Positive	This film is about a man who has been too caught up with the accepted convention of success, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. He assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.<br /><br />His was infatuated with her at first, going to the dance class just to idolize her, but he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. It eventually becomes apparent to him that there is more to life than working yourself to death. There is a set of oddball characters also learning in the studio, giving the film a lot of laughs and some sense of bonding between the dejected.<br /><br />There is also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving some depth to them by showing their blemished past and their struggle to overcome it.<br /><br />The dancing was also engaging, with the big competition at the end, but it is not the usual story where our underdog come out at the top by winning it. Instead, there are downfalls, revelations and redemption.<br /><br />All these makes it a moving and fun film to watch.
Positive	This is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I care about. <br /><br />I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.<br /><br />This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)<br /><br />Also watch for the cameos from known character actors.
Positive	"This group of English pros are a pleasure to watch. The supporting cast could form a series of their own. It's a seen before love tiangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the superior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable ""romp"". The only quibble is that it's hard to accept that the smoldering Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can readily understand why Robson Green would light her fire, with apologies to the ""Doors"". The guy who almost steals the show with a great ""laid back"" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in ""The Way We Live Now"", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is hard to forget as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen, and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies as I've said could have their own series. They are that good. The whole thing is a great deal of fun, and I heartily recommend it, and thank you imdbman for letting the paying customers have their say in this fascinating venue."
Positive	Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. Had me snifflin' like a baby as I left the theatre, trying not to let anyone see. So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.<br /><br />What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer, together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. <br /><br />The story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends. All these years later, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is one hell of a great movie.
Positive	"Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called ""Cream."" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.<br /><br />Well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful DVD concert disc shows us. I was always extremely familiar with Clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, neither of whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. Bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. This is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.<br /><br />Some people criticized this show for being low-key. I don't agree with that. I have no complaints. The concert sounded very good. The second song, ""Spoonful,"" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
Positive	My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.<br /><br />David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the liveliest and most credible performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a delight (he even gets in a remark about Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish.<br /><br />Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, somewhat subdued and not garish at all, is excellent and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter. Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end, another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Positive	_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing. As André Dussolier quits the film and leaves Josiane Balasko to play his part (great actress, she's hilariously serious especially when, in Dussolier's role, she bitches about herself), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played.<br /><br />Actually, for whoever does not know the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know French Cinema, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be missed, but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging, on acting, on public life...
Positive	Great fun. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie. In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this 'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they keep repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they get funnier and funnier. In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we sure had a good time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the film. If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it. Apart from Clooney This movie deserves a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating it has at the time I write this, but when more ppl have seen it I am sure it will go up. 7.0 is reasonable I guess, I would give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers)<br /><br />
Positive	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship. Still, what was there was interesting. The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was quite something as well. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself.
Positive	"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her ""Hello Sister""!!!. This sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />A sensitively made film with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well crafted film has moments which will forever remain etched in one's memory  the awkward first kiss & Abhay's swift apology; Abhay describing Soha as ""class wali ladki"" & hastily adding ""that he doesn't love her""; his gifting a churidar to Soha & asking her out for a date.<br /><br />The music is good & the background music excellent. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disappears. The stillness conveys both the awkwardness & tenderness of the relationship.<br /><br />The poignant ending makes for a bitter sweet film, the memories of which will linger for a long long time.<br /><br />A must see I will rate it 8.5/10"
Positive	The true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would say this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Great plan. Even if you don't know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters, with party scenes and a montage of their loot, is weak and insulting. The story was better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie should have been all about him, his life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders about to fade away.<br /><br />P.S. Although it isn't official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It isn't entirely factual, but it's far more enjoyable.
Positive	For those of you who are not aware with the theme that Kusturica continues to explore intermittently in his films--the Western assault on traditional Serbian values--it will be impossible for you to understand his narratives. This continuous theme, expressed through fantasy and outrageous comedy as its vehicle, is one that Kusturica has elected to mandate. Since his fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films' 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life is a Miracle', and recently with 'Promise Me This', his slapstick, carnivalistic style underscores the 'westernization' of Balkan culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and village (traditional idiom) space are contrasted. The world of the city reflects western attributes that have ensconced the spatial and temporal setting; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity and vehement disregard for traditional values--as expressed toward the young kid--villager. The end of the film further exemplifies this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision coarse; appropriately, the wedding, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, i.e. traditional values, are about to collide with the funeral mourners, exemplifying the death of tradition within this context. Yet Kusturica brilliantly examines this theme through his own unique, stylistic singularity. With his outrageous and flamboyant style serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
Positive	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it."
Positive	"Woody Allen's second movie set in London. Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love. She's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees.<br /><br />I like this better than the over rated ""Match Point"" from last year. It was shorter and moved much more quickly. The plot is old but I was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end. It's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines (all from Allen of course). It's not one of Allen's best but it's far better than his worst.<br /><br />The acting is, for the most part, very good. Allen is bad but he's played this character a million times before and it's gotten tiresome. But Johansson and Jackman are just great--they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances. Also Allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal--there is a sequence where they're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies. The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shot London. He's not as off as he was on ""Match Point"" though--maybe he'll just get better as he goes along.<br /><br />Worth seeing. I give it an 8."
Positive	For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely impress you, because of how honorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book (down to the last line).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little tricky. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a strong element of realism to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof'. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but that is essentially what realism involves. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, then good luck finding it. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
Positive	"Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a wonderful affirmation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is remembering how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience has left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.<br /><br />Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself (""I'm going to bury that bastard,"" she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.<br /><br />Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It is tremendously moving.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands is superb. The film is superb. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are."
Positive	I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; the fact that I rather enjoyed this, coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again. There is brief language in this. I recommend this to any fan of romance stories. 7/10
Positive	In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well. Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either. That all changes as the movie goes along. The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences, dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area. I know that that seems like very low humor, but some of it is actually very funny. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is funnier than he was in K-9 and the action sequences at are better too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you'll love this movie.
Positive	"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a nice idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had his own puppies. The cutest of the Dalmatians was, of course, little Snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film. <br /><br />To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed completely kind. In fact I have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly, but now that she so quickly changed into ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I almost began to be really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner, was much better than I had expected. I also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /><br />Of course I was content that at the end the Dalmatians were saved again, but I would have liked to know what was going to happen to Cruella after she had lost her whole property. And what on earth could the dogs' home do with such a huge sum of money?<br /><br />Finally, it was quite touching that Snowball also had spots at the very end of the film."
Positive	"Sure, it's a 50's drive-in special, but don't let that fool you. In my little book, there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor. Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color, a wise decision, since the blob would not show up well in b&w. Yes, the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate. But except for several of the teens, the non-Hollywood cast performs well. Then too, the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining. Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with ""juvenile delinquents"". Then again, the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department, but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, helped along, no doubt, by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play. And except for the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm awaiting the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water."
Positive	A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops, and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, and Glasnost symbolically comes. Excellent script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is superb and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can't hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
Positive	This really is an incredible film. Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States up for its dishonesty, subterfuge, and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before.<br /><br />And in the cross hairs we see the USA, once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality. It's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish film makers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez.<br /><br />We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit. First phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are, and this documentary does a great job of doing just that.
Positive	Considering it was made on a low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to make the most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects work.<br /><br />The story involves a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. Thus the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.<br /><br />Mixing in elements of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, THE DAY TIME ENDED, despite its obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the superb special effects work of David Allen. The desert setting is very appropriate for this film's close encounters; and while the movie cannot really be compared with either Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, THE DAY TIME ENDED is much better than many other 2001/CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, for at least trying--and on that basis, I give THE DAY TIME ENDED a 7 out of 10.
Positive	This is the best picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives. <br /><br />Laced with dreams - dripping in reality, the American Dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan better than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection cast as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It's real. The on-screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heart-warmers, you're going to love this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there. My popcorn became the a la mode'. <br /><br />And hey: buy the CD! The music rocks and carries the story magnificently! Syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should, an area that disappoints me more often than not.<br /><br />Criticisms: I'd have given the baseball to somebody else. But Quaid has something to teach us all about character' and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them. A little long. Worth every minute in the last analysis. 8 / 10. <br /><br />
Positive	I was on France, around March 05, and I love to go to this Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never went to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /><br />The film is stunning. It doesn't caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users, because it was french-subtitled but it's still shocking.<br /><br />This film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kinda connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? Man on Fire, that was stunningly strong, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico. Or it is like The Brave One. A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more believable. Verdict: A film that shocks and makes you believe that there's no security on the streets anymore. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and astonishing performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that you won't forget soon. Leaves you shaking and stunned.
Positive	"With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution, living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />I got a kick out of all the gags in the film, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit. Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - precisely!<br /><br />I'm not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board, all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on it's way to hornomania."
Positive	"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's lovely, warm, sentimental, very very romantic. I've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable. <br /><br />The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was superb and I'd never change any of them- but I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br /> It's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it's executed to perfection. <br /><br />The romantic yearnings are truly palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated, love's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep, the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection, are so touchingly delivered. Again and again, you will find yourself moved. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning.<br /><br />Do see this - it's lovely."
Positive	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ""tricked"" into falling in love with Gillian? <br /><br />As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular. It's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it. Just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread. The movie's cute, funny at times, and touching in the end. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have some real chemistry. Novak (as others have pointed out) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? Had director Richard Quine stuck with just one approach, the movie might have been even better and more memorable."
Positive	There's something compelling and strangely believable about this episode. From the very beginning, an atmosphere of tension is created by the knowledge that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have beamed down to evacuate the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have left already for parts unknown, except for an elderly librarian.<br /><br />The librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a crisis in which all three Enterprise crew members find themselves unexpectedly hurled into different eras of the planet's past. Kirk finds himself in a time period resembling 17th Century England, while Spock and McCoy are stranded in a desolate, frozen waste. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the different hazardous situations the men find themselves in is superbly handled, with return to the present an unknown chance, while the minutes are counting down to the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Imaginative writing and fine acting characterize this episode, with a touching performance by Mariette Hartley as a woman exiled to the Ice Age, and Ian Wolfe as the urbane Librarian. Somewhat reminiscent of the classic episode City On The Edge of Forever, this time travel story is a rich and compelling finale to the series, which concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the best of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally lesser quality of the third season overall.
Positive	Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract audience. They are, of course showing the main message of the movie:<br /><br />People who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have somewhere else, to notoriously oppress others. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.<br /><br />A movie showing this as brutally as Hundstage is surely tough to face, but having to endure such lives, is even tougher.<br /><br />Technically the film is much like Short Cuts, but consisting of documentary style episodes, featuring people like your neighbour, playing just the way they are. Without any glitter, and most disturbingly, without any hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing, because you realize, such people are out there, and there are many of them, although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks. Somewhere the porn industry has to do its business, somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place, somewhere hopes have to shatter. I sure do know such people.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but this happens for real) and without any melodramatic, go watch this movie. However it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles I fear, as subtitles can´t transport accentuation.
Positive	From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2.
Positive	I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. It's a great movie. Emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why I did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. I was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. The movie itself is fun and smart. So don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
Positive	"It could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art.<br /><br />It is, however, a beautiful movie. I have loved it since local channels used to show it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (Many love ""The Fallen Idol"" but I am not among them. I think I saw ""Brighton Rock"" once many years ago and liked it but maybe I'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) This is superbly cast. Charles Boyer does not, it's true, come across as Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl who falls for him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I attribute that to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, is excellent -- as always.<br /><br />And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart. She comes across as a precocious early teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She does her best.<br /><br />I recommend this movie highly. Not without reservations. The reservation is, primarily, that it is a little stolid. But the story and acting can scarcely be bettered."
Positive	"I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.<br /><br />It's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like ""lame plot"" and ""it's much cruder than the show."" Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode? Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot.<br /><br />And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect Dukes plot. In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen.<br /><br />While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions, they do a great job and work very well together. I wasn't too keen on Burt's Boss Hogg though. And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a little... scary.<br /><br />And who didn't have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard?<br /><br />Folks, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikinis and car chases, you won't be sorry. It's just a great dumb movie!"
Positive	"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" is a remake of 1947's ""Brideless Groom,"" widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. The remake contains most of the footage from that film. The new scenes, shot May 17, 1955, include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp's sisters, along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used; if you blink, you will miss the double's appearance.) <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters. Budget considerations, coupled with fewer bookings for two-reel comedies, influenced the decision to use older footage.<br /><br />Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges, most of their releases by 1955-56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in. ""Husbands Beware,"" while one of these hybrids, is watchable and entertaining; we get to see most of ""Brideless Groom"" again, and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film. This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp, and it was released six weeks after his death.<br /><br />7 out of 10."
Positive	"Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after Batman:Dead End that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! This is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! Even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. Although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions ""other"" superhero related movies. Here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. Finally, a Superman that actually looks ""super"" and looks like the real thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver. I just wish that some sensible Warner Bros. exec gives the OK to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. I don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to DVD, I would never get tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. Hope the ""bigwigs"" at Marvel & DC productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. No more ""Batman & Robin"" fiasco, or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to ""reinvent"" the hero for the movie, just to have it ""bomb"" in theaters. Mr. Collora...We need more directors like you!!"
Positive	Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her! Mario must save the day again. Unlike the 2-D games, Mario can explore anything he wants to. He can just roam around, climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups, find secrets in levels, and more. You can spend four hours in one level. No time limits. There are 16 worlds, with a number of stages, and there are star doors, which you need a certain number of stars to get into. Once you get in these star doors, you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage. To get to certain worlds, you need a number of stars to get in. You enter the world by going through a painting. There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay, I don't see how anyone could dislike this game. It's great. This launch title is the game that insured gamers that the N64 would have a good life. Every 3D plat-form game we know of has something in common with SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used. Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games. 10 out of 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find used, because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 10.
Positive	"You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, a US secret agent soldier tough guy who is sent to uncover Nazi secret and turn the tide of World War II. That means everything from breaking out of a Nazi dungeon to thwarting Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer himself.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the most influential game of its time. That's because it literally inspired obsession. Many games existed at the time and even more do today, but every so often you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before it and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is better in almost every respect, but the shots heard around the world which led to one of gaming's biggest tidal waves were fired by B.J. Blazkowicz. The Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe their existence to the guys at ID. Whether directly or, in most cases, indirectly, but they still do.<br /><br />Even with its old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay (this is really a game, games now border on the ""experience level"") and highly rectangular levels, the scope of all six episodes provides lots of fun. Especially discovering those secrets with treasure and a chaingun in them.<br /><br />Also: ""Halt!"" *bang! bang! bang!* ""AARRRGH!!!"" never grows old. --- 8/10<br /><br />Voluntarily rated PC-13 for ""profound carnage."" However, it's exceptionally tame when compared to what games have today."
Positive	"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout."
Positive	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.<br /><br />The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. Great acting, and very memorable. Also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam. Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.<br /><br />Fantastic film. Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />Rating 9 out of 10.
Positive	"THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising, considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />""The Fourth Man"" is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In ""The Fourth Man"" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story. <br /><br />Nevertheless, when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 7/10"
Positive	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often better than his material, and almost always under appreciated. He's been in a ton of films either as a heavy or a hero, and has the type of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery did half a century before him. Baker can delivery material that would sound ridiculous coming out of another actor, and that's what's so great about him. He really seems to mean what he's saying, regardless of how cliché, obvious or silly, which puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. It's what made the WALKING TALL Trilogy work so well, and that same magic is here in FINAL JUSTICE. This was a substantial hit in theaters and on video in the 80s, and it has aged a lot better than many of the perhaps better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's a real timeless quality that doesn't jar you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his best. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost gems of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grit and violence. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to love it as much as I do.
Positive	"A film that is so much a 30's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.<br /><br />Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners, a studio that was one of the ""big five"" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.<br /><br />Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been ""torn from the headlines"". Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that ""They're not the trophies"" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) Curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing.<br /><br />Thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along."
Positive	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was ABLE to finish the book it was a revelation! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a superb work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.
Positive	"Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he's come to London to buy coal in ""Confidential Agent,"" a 1945 film also starring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he's accused of murder but he's determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight the Fascists.<br /><br />This film has its good and not so good points. It rates high for atmosphere and for suspense, and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is slimy, Hendrix appropriately pathetic, and Seymour outrageously wonderful.<br /><br />The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is terrific in his role even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not of the British upper class. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. Her acting isn't up to snuff either; she's better in other films. But she's an astonishing looking woman, and much can be forgiven.<br /><br />Paxinou is nearly over the top and hateful. Dan Seymour almost steals the entire film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. It's a great part and his performance is perfect, while some of the direction of the other actors isn't as good. This was definitely a case of no small parts, only small actors. Seymour wasn't a small actor.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws."
Positive	"So, what's the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein? Why would the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately loved it, and watched it every week. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its ""realism"", and I do love/hate the show, but it could not be farther from real for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong, does. But for once, there's a drama that's REALLY real. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are really out there, and I relate to each and every one of them. I can't seem to get enough. I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean-counting butts and continue this show. Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there. This could be one of the best shows of all time. If somebody will just let it."
Positive	"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had ""more important"" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too ""girly."" <br /><br />Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House has made me laugh and cry. It's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. What's any more real than that? <br /><br />If anything the show has lifted me up when I'm down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)"
Positive	The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939.Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the one great movie of the year.Big on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India .The picture is bigger still in its scope and sweep,is thrill and action but biggest biggest of all in the life breathes through three(Gary Grant,Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) roaring,reckless,swaggering sons of the thundering gunfighters men who stride its mighty scenes in the flesh and blood of high adventure,it's a honest film of it all that makes Gunga Din a new experience in entertainment .Joan Fontaine gambled her against the valiant sergeants three.The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr aflame through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where anything can happen. The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one mighty show.It's a fabulous,furious and far-flung adventure with the red-blood and gunpowder heroes who rise from the storied mystery of India and storm the screen with the lusty,rousing,robust life-thunder of men who fight for the love of it and love for the fun of it.The pictures is interpreted for the brave and roguish Gary Grant who rounded hundred villains Thugs and the mean Guru(Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant shouts : You're under arrest!.Besides is the heroic water man,Sam Jaffe,who regiment colonel(Montagu Love) says of him : You're a better man than I am,Gunga Din!
Positive	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous. She look great; Boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex-priest seeking life seems pretty stale, but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works, given the two stars, the terrific score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting cast. The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited, plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson the mother superior, Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the diviner, and Basil Rathbone plays.... well I'm not sure. He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted, John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color. She looks great and wears some terrific clothes. My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek-like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />Certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars.
Positive	I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times, as if they were making it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue, but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />A remarkably atmospheric, well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
Positive	"Updated from a previous comment. The great and underrated Marion Davies shows her comedic stuff in this late (1928) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit player in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star.<br /><br />A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a hoot. A must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the slimy leading man.<br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story does parallel the rise of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Davies and Haines were huge MGM stars and friends. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're great together! A sweet romance and delightful spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear."
Positive	"I hand't seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a great movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone cept for her black maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city ( New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in great style!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that films ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby FAce any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will love it. Highly recommended! See it!"
Positive	"Once again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap (I mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.<br /><br /> The direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I wasn't too disappointed.<br /><br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. Usually, these movies require all four of those elements. The PG rating is well-deserved--not like ""Sixteen Candles"" where the ""f"" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.<br /><br /> I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could've been developed more. The film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. They end up kissing at the end, but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced.<br /><br />""The Dream Machine"" is no gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. It's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for Haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect.<br /><br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)"
Positive	"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. The switches between the bold colours of ""the real world"" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation. <br /><br />All of the performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br /><br />This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful."
Positive	"Sure it was well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was just so weak. And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon. Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Cousin Vinnie? I mean come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I didn't really like this guy at all. He cheats in sports, talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom. How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The twist was even weaker. I mean come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams. Saying that I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I can't say it's a bad film. In fact I must say that I must say it's good enough, nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I can't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head."
Positive	"So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd pass a half hour watching ""Girlfight"" while waiting for ""Hart's War"" to start. With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation 'B' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. Instead it is a well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" I thought ""wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar"". Needless to say, I didn't watch ""Hart's War"" that night."
Positive	It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. See for example the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants, the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn. Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.<br /><br />This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case. It's a fun film before all. Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about. Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies. His style is direct and grotesque, we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops melds present, history and magic, and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema.<br /><br />This is not a perfect film either. The principal flaw is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up. It is yet one of the most catching, amusing, moving films that I have seen lately.
Positive	I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. I have always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just MIGHT, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.
Positive	I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the best films for ripping apart I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks!! The continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it, it slaps you in the face with the holes. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true)on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion. ......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? Who cares, its magic. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'.<br /><br />Get some mates over, get a few drinks in, put this film on and howl.
Positive	"Bell, Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenoms we see today (back in the 70's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film). It made Novak a huge star, put a nice item on Jack Lemon's resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers (both went on to continue to play witches and other curious ""old bats"", in film and television).<br /><br />Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch (which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the grand film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holidays, and, despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft, actually embodies a great deal of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc).<br /><br />I will always watch this movie (have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, substance, a great cast, and terrific production values. And like Adam's Rib, it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time, are radical even now (in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful), and so always seems ahead of the times."
Positive	Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.
Positive	I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.<br /><br />After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.<br /><br />One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.<br /><br />The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.<br /><br />It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
Positive	"Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox the writer/director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature ""Yossi & Jagger"" (2002). This comparative epic, at 1hr 53 minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like myself, need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity.<br /><br />While ""Yossi & Jagger"" focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service, ""Ha Buah"" is centred on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, who share a unit in the heart of Israel's generally gay-tolerant, but not always gay-friendly, capital Tel Aviv.<br /><br />""Ha Buah"" opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller  Yossi from ""Yossi & Jagger"") first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid). Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether.<br /><br />From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow this film's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />The soundtrack for ""Ha Buah"" is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i.e. real life in the Middle East.<br /><br />The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best."
Positive	"This show is quick-witted, colorful, dark yet fun, hip and still somehow clean. The cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is electric. It's got murder, romance, family, AND zombies without ever coming off as cartoony... Somehow. You really connect with these characters. The whole production is an unlikely magic act that left me, something of a skeptic if I do say so myself, totally engrossed and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like somebody paid me to write it. It really is that good. I just heard a rumor that it was being canceled so I thought I'd send off a flare of good will. This is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Do yourself a huge favor, if you haven't already, and enjoy this gem while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is clever. What that means is that every armchair critic/""writer"" in Hollywood is gonna insert a stick up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an ""I could've written that"" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words: the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet ""critics"" aren't commenting on, give my fave' show a spin. It's fun. Good, unpretentious fun."
Positive	first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this: Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), captured something magical. it's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. it's an idea.<br /><br />How, may you ask? i shall explain. star wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so profoundly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very well, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. but even before 1-3, there was amazing depth to it all. it felt real, as if capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a historical account of a galaxy far, far away.<br /><br />Star Wars is definitely something far above the norm, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very small. i feel as though i've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. i get a tingling feeling when i see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me more than any physical thing could ever hope.
Positive	I still wonder why I watched this movie. Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep. Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film, settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup.
Positive	"This is where the term ""classic film"" comes from. This is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery, courage and extreme loyalty. Poor Olan got sold to her uncaring husband, who through the years learned to appreciate her. (Yeah right, A PEARL!!) <br /><br />Luise Rainer was the beautiful star who had won the Best Actress Oscar the year before for her small role (and what a waste of an oscar) in ""The Great Zigfield"". It really didn't show what, if any, talent she had other than her exotic beauty. But in ""Good Earth"" she shows that she can really act! Her beauty was erased and she had no great costumes either. People say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film. Like hell. Her character Olan is a shy and timid woman, with inner strength. She is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions. Example: those scenes during the fall of the city and when looters were being shot. If you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film, you are NOT looking!<br /><br />Paul Muni shows that he can act as well. His character is not a likeable one to me. He never sees her for what she is, until the very end of the story. A sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother, with her own special beauty. The greatest one of all, the beauty from within, like a pearl.<br /><br />If you get a chance to see this film, watch it. You will see one of the best films that the golden age of Hollywood created."
Positive	"Men of Honor has many great aspects to it. Good action sequences, plenty of ""feel good"" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is focused about Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the navy. It chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. It is a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times before. A person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. It could happen, but a lot of the struggles the Brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the C.O. of the diving school tampering with his final test. However, all of that is made up for the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Chief Sunday who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. As soon as Deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. In the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes."
Positive	A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She has to stay at home since the family cannot afford a maid. She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected. The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever. Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed. This is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement, things will change, someone has understood.
Positive	I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it doesn't, because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - original, creative, quirky and humorous. It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about nothing, as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world. The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors, both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit. However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion, with the combination of good performances, a strong script, nice sound design and (fairly) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />It's just a shame so few people know about Nothing....
Positive	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid. The characters were engaging and I like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying.<br /><br />Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. I like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him.<br /><br />All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I just wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve.
Positive	"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its most inaccurate and un-factual. It sets up parallel plots for no less stellar an entourage than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille floats dangerously close toward the truth, but just as easily veers away from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to buttress Custer's last stand with a heap of fiction that is only loosely based on the lives of people, who were already the product of manufactured stuffs and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a zeitgeist in the annals of entertainment, but a pretty campy relic by today's standards.<br /><br />TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, this is a moderately appealing transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There's a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it at other moments. All in all, the image quality is therefore somewhat inconsistent, but it is never all bad or all good  just a bit better than middle of the road. Age related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital anomalies do not distract. The audio is mono but nicely balanced.<br /><br />EXTRAS: Forget it. It's Universal! BOTTOM LINE: As pseudo-history painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just take its characters and story with a grain of salt  in some cases  a whole box seems more appropriate!"
Positive	"The most satisfying element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy."
Positive	How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old serial; I rejoiced in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly friendly and lively. It's the document of a longlost craft. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply optimistic and hedonistic . It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too muchChandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and protects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather discreet and moderate way.<br /><br />As to the quite sexy niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti: the sordid Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is in fact multiply kidnappedin a sarcophagus after being sent asleep with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, creepy ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imageryand are a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /><br />Would you protect a girl as bravely as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old libidinous and quite heartless, mean drunk, and this only contributed to his performances. He is the prototypical mean drunk uncle, mischievous and cunning and oblique. This might sound like a rather crooked homage to Lugosiyet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong sympathy for the decrepit actor. I enjoy Lugosi' fancy performances.<br /><br />This serial is unjustly bashed.
Positive	"This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a follow-up in name only. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called ""Big Bay Ty"" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a sweetly feisty performance by cute, pigtailed future ""Different Strokes"" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very gentle and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at a leisurely pace, astutely capturing the workaday minutiae of the rural town in compellingly exact detail, drawing the assorted country characters with great warmth and affection, and thankfully developing the sentiment in an organic, restrained, unforced manner that never degenerates into sticky-sappy mush. The adorable Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") gives an engagingly plucky portrayal of the kids' loving working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer enjoyably irascible support as a couple of squabbling ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's capable, sunny cinematography displays the woodsy setting in all its sumptuously tranquil, achingly pure and fragile untouched by civilization splendor. Darrell Deck's score adeptly blends flesh-crawling synthesizer shudders and jubilant banjo-pluckin' country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this picture warrants special praise for the way it uncannily predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue by a good 15-odd years in advance."
Positive	"It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film. There were moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible. Only problem is, when she finds Johnny's one-handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and there love goes on to that moon scene (where the title comes from). Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Director for Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Snap out of it!""), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!"
Positive	"""And All Through the House"" is a special crypt episode not only because it's from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember as a young man being on vacation with my parents that summer in 1989 in our hotel room in South Carolina on HBO I saw this episode and I was buried to the Crypt right then and forever! I had always been a fan of horror-suspense series and liked monster movies, and with this series started by HBO I again had fearful pleasure. This episode being the first one I saw is memorable for me and one of my favorites, it's just so enjoyable with a nice twist. ""And All Through the House"" has a nice cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which is a perfect way to get you relaxed for holiday chopping! Well anyway you have Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance. Only like most horror series things take a turn for the worst and bad people get what they deserve. The odds are greatly stacked when a maniac dressed as Santa escapes from a local nut house, making for a late holiday chopping on Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you learn bad people get what they axe for! Well this tale ends with a perfect holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!"
Positive	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />I don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.
Positive	This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's still a competent thriller, the machine carried on without him perfectly, but  something was missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always interesting, sometimes brilliant, the screenplays often noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK if a bit of a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A lot happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well.
Positive	Though I'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty. The great, tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk, who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number. Perhaps best off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a marvellous touch. Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times, this is a beautiful piece of entertainment, with swell characters and plotting, even the odd neat character arc, a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere. An ethereal treasure, highly recommended.
Positive	But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..enjoy! <br /><br />Tom Hulce is magnificent as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls. He really just wants to be a good boy, to do the right thing, and to make his brother proud of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking. Those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a great song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate..but you hear it in a bar.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. No such luck. Liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget.
Positive	"I saw this film at a time when I was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own. Maybe that is the reason why I took it so seriously. I believed totally in the poor character's psychological degradation inside a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I'm giving all the credit to Polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but I fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatre's manager. Luckily for me, my life on my own didn't turn out as disastrous as this (so far) but I have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the (fake) reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race. This film is the sum of many, many instances of great acting and great casting. As some performances were done in English (the scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I heartily recommend, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment building trilogy"" which also comprises ""Repulsion"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". Unfortunately, ""Repulsion"" still hasn't made it to a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. Needless to say, the three films would make a magnificent boxset."
Positive	"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. in her 22 years of life, she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids. i have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and i still think to this day that nobody is, or ever will give a damn about her and her condition. Then i saw this film.<br /><br />I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were lucky. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can't utter a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things. but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister, and the ending (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK!!! This film is seriously underrated, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. thinking you can't write well? this guy wrote with his foot. thinking you're not attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy couldn't even stand up.<br /><br />My point: Parents of young children, i suggest your children watch this movie with you, so they'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they don't stare at them like they're aliens. My sister got millions of stares, and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people. This film will teach people, that people who might not seem ""normal"" are people too. 10/10"
Positive	"""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him, hence movie title. He is uproarious, daring, and moronic. But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason, he is a somewhat likable character. Sidney befriends a fellow journalist, the composed Alison Olsen, played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst. However, Sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox. This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on ""eye candy"" material. Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. Those are the peak comedic moments of the film. However, I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison; even though Team Weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise. Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges was again building ""The Dude"" bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez. But the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here. ""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" should not be alienated entirely, but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average"
Positive	"Featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo, ""Seven Pounds"" races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a flick which I also loved. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project isn't quite so high-profile. <br /><br />Too bad I figured out Will Smith's scheme early on, I put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease.<br /><br />However, I still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends (bookends are the first and the last scene) in that way, it's the source of urgency and tension in the movie, finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character flourish and develop, knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two.<br /><br />One of my friends with whom I saw the movie thought Smith's character could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones, yet at other times he could be harsh and scary, and when he's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely. It's quite a versatile performance.<br /><br />Lastly I can't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment, which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music. Put this on your list."
Positive	"The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.<br /><br />The main protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed"") they instantly 'fall' for each other, but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship. she manipulates him to kill her parents, to protect their 'love' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad (David Lascher future 'Sabrina' cast mate for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, began portrayed Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television.<br /><br />Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called ""Clarissa Darling "" or Sabrina Spellman""<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch this on the internet, so i suggest check it out."
Positive	This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a minor role in this film also.<br /><br />But the real stars are the young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is sort of a Friends/Sex in the City thing going on (mostly gay), and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace.<br /><br />But, that's the rub. No matter how many posters you put up or how many raves for peace you have, the war is not going to end. Many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table, but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the US, who just want it all and will not consider peace. There are many on the Palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come. It is in no one's interest to end this war, and the children suffer.<br /><br />This is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film. It won't go away. You know something tragic is going to happen and, of course, it does. With the feelings on both sides running strong, and revenge as the motivator, tragedy always happens, and that is what makes this an adult version of Friends/Sex in the City. There is no superficiality. It is real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
Positive	For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is a pity though, because this is easily the most original and clever animation I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a real deep storyline, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals, a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years. This gives the show a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very different. At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach. I believe David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic).<br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-twisting show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should not miss. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to watch it to the end. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not too annoying. The only question remains though, where is the DVD?!
Positive	I think this movie is a very funny film and one of the best 'National Lampoon's' films, it also has a very catchy spoof title, which basically sums up what the whole movie is about.... Men In White!!!! The story is a spoof of many films including a Will Smith film, as you might have guessed, 'Men In Black'. I will not give the ending away but it has a very good ending in is very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humour) from start to finish, especially the bit near the beginning when thy are in the street collecting the dustbins (Garbage Cans). Also, they have a pretty cool dustbin lorry (Garbage Collecting Truck) in that scene too. The acting is not superb, actually, it is not very good, but that is what makes the film funny, it is a comedy, loosen up!! I love the story line, partly because it is so far fetched and partly because it is interesting to see how subtle (Or should it be Un-subtle) they rip off all the other films. I am great fan of un-serious spoof films, but i am also a fan of the real thing, and with this films, it is hard to decide which is better, the film it mainly rips off (mentioned earlier i this review) or the actual film it is, but also when you are actually making a spoof of comedy films, it actually makes it even harder, but this film carries it off successfully. The two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This film is a must for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, National Lampoon's film to date!!
Positive	"This was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very height of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, ciefly because it starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much better film - better made in all departments, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is, rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing has to be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week!"
Positive	"Why the crap is this movie rated so low?! I've seen this movie over 25 times, I know EVERY line to this movie. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop ""Airman"" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or ""Sir Swish."" Mainly they're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts, they even go as far as to make one up called ""Townsell."" I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts: ""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over: ""Minnesota."" Let us not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes. After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year. During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak, which is actually a day after they invent the game. As the movie follows we find out that Coop, Remer, and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left. The story follows with zany blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders, and humor so absurd it'll leave you crying for more. Watch it dude, it's hilarious."
Positive	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, but I did like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I didn't find Justin's acting that bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, but it's a pretty impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, but I found it well done. L L Cool J's character was clearly conflicted, but I honestly didn't know what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I love Kevin SPacey, he was kind of just there. HIs character didn't have a whole lot of substance, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can do no wrong.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop. Truly believable and really in character, he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, but it was surprisingly well done and I didn't find any of that. Every shooting had a point, it wasn't clichéd, pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall, amazing cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in theatres, it was better than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.
Positive	"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie."" Thus entereth the ""Almighty Solo Movie Night""!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.<br /><br />***7/10***<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. It's great to hear the far under appreciated Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled."
Positive	The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in superb performance) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a terrific performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her out to dinner. They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment. They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to put an end to it, but he rapes her. This incident scars her. She goes to a club meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (greatfully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far. They strike a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well. In other words introduces her to a different world. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You watch the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist, but he does a terrific job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world. This film deserves an award.
Positive	"I saw the movie recently and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. This movie is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but handles the whole aging theme with incredible authenticity. It's really really tough to have the main character as unlikable as Hagar. The director does a masterful job with the challenge. Hagar's hard to understand. Her world has hard edges and she isn't a warm endearing woman at all.<br /><br />The first scene gets this across without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is being taken to a nursing home by her son and daughter-in-law. She figures it out en-route and freaks out. Her edges are really hard. She is mean. She is belittling and selfish. She is a stone. I didn't like her - not even a little bit.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the movie, we get insight. We find out why she doesn't like petunias, why she favors one son over the other, how her losses have formed her character... I started to see the angel... and I started to like her. I especially liked her when she poured out her secrets to the boy in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you are a brilliant actor. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene!<br /><br />This isn't a ""feel good"" movie, but it is certainly a movie that brings the viewer to empathy. I understand more clearly that hard edges in a person's life are there to protect, they are there for a reason...<br /><br />Hagar isn't my mother - she isn't even my mother-in-law or neighbor... but parts of her are present in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts somehow make more sense to me now that I've watched The Stone Angel."
Positive	This is an old fashioned, wonderfully fun children's movie with surely the most appealing novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is simply a magical tale of hocus pocus that is cute, light hearted, and charming.<br /><br />The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids. They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they encounter Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course marvelously endearing as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both wonderful fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such memorable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it does boast some appealing little tunes. Some have been critical, but the movie features excellent special effects. All in all, the story is enchanting family entertainment. It's a pity if modern children are too sophisticated for this lovely & bewitching tale, which should appeal to the child in all of us.
Positive	If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build. It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment. <br /><br />He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed. Of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist. <br /><br />It's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK> <br /><br />Come to think of it, did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
Positive	"This is a movie that gets better each time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight, bringing sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only ""villian"" in the movie, and his oily charms are well used here. Frank Morgan, is delightful as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is well used here. I especially liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. Very believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan doing an outstanding job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet charming and attractive woman.<br /><br />This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though. The movie is presented from his point of view, with the action rotating around him. Mr. Stewart is more then up to the task of carrying the movie, with an amazing performance that uses a wide range of emotions. Just watch Stewart, when he is fired from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to convey the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that so traumatic an event causes, so perfectly. In my estimation, James Stewart is, without question, the greatest film actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else that has ever been captured on film that is able to so completely convey what he is feeling to an audience. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely the master of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewarts best movies, and also one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you will find. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those that appreciate the work of Stewart."
Positive	At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.
Positive	"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.<br /><br />""Dan in Real Life"" is a great surprise and a delightful movie, with comedy, romance and drama. The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves Marie. The trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning, with a realistic behavior of a family meeting. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns' family. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Eu, Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada"" (""Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend"")"
Positive	Oh, those sneaky Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.<br /><br />The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it's a great movie nevertheless. This of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment.<br /><br />Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. These early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. It's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies.<br /><br />8/10
Positive	I'm a fan of both actors/singers especially Gackt and when I first discover this movie and watch the trailer,I just think this is a silly one.After a long waiting time,I watched it at last and here's my comment...<br /><br />I consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it,instead of it my first applause goes to acting,generally that Japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting.Yet in MoonChild's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it,especially Gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well,I like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones,as for HYDE part,his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor,respectively as his character do,throughout the movie.I didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget,it still has brilliant moments,but the real jewel of the film is story.It has some cheesy moments but it's OK for me,and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes,on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals.An interesting note aside,this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful(not handsome,beautiful)actors of American cinema,actually Moon Child is somehow can be seen as brother with Interwiew,yet original on it's own.Only problem that MoonChild is it's a bit slow sometimes,I'm a Japanese movie fan and I used to that but it's not change MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters.But all in all;this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes,as for actors/singers duo I hope to see their other movies in future,and I recommend this to everyone who likes vampire-action-sci-fiction and romance films 8/10
Positive	In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In a great comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel. Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by William Sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. Watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />Though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky. <br /><br />This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. The fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />The first watch I hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.
Positive	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a shoestring budget by writer/director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was improvised...in the best sense of the word. Silberling had the good fortune to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance the life of the other.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an actor who has been out of work for four years, scouting a location for a little 'filler film' to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a market manager and he is dropped off at seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally angry about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the tender bonding between Freeman and Paz it works very well. This is one of those little films about human relationships where being vulnerable to change and exchange is the message. It is well worth viewing, and this is a DVD that has featurettes that are touching, informative, and comic - a pleasure to view. Grady Harp
Positive	this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now, i feel compelled to add my perspective...and no, i'm not associated to the movie makers in any way (yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI i'm in my late 20s<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies, because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie, he is already an instant classic, much as Scrat from Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo. Anyway i had a great time watching this and can't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.<br /><br />8,5 for me
Positive	I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and appreciated his love of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.
Positive	"What do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS? You make a movie, of course. The probable reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that Eddie Nash would have been in the way of its production. So it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Nash was sent to prison.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is its quick pace. There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap. And why would it be? There is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.The cast is good. Kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies, so here was finally a role quite suitable for him. Bosworth is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts (she's solid), and McDermott, who is otherwise quite annoying, is rather good, to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that I didn't recognize him at first. (I wish they did that to Cruise in every movie so I wouldn't have to watch his dumb face.) I utterly failed to recognize Christina Applegate, and wouldn't have known she was in it, had I not seen her name in the end-credits. Kudrow is charming as ever, a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role. (Btw, ""Friends"" is the worst TV sitcom of all time.) The only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by Carrie Fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron Janeane Garofalo. You thought I'd include Paris Hilton, too, didn't you? No, I think Hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore. Because the film is about decadence, among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly."
Positive	"It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history!! The upsurge in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered superior!! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a doggerel of eighties, happy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history!! Set in Minneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well!! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which effortlessly captivated the movie audience!! I loved the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success, is indeed, brilliant!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something right!! ""Purple Rain"" put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS UP!!!!"
Positive	This early film has its flaws-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It's also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically; note, for examples, the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery.<br /><br />Its core, though, remains the final match, which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing. Even though you know that the hero has to win, it becomes quite believable that he will lose, and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to his, motivating the final plot pay-off, is very well entwined with the progress of the match. The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (even though this is a silent film, the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them). The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid, and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it.<br /><br />The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight, a public domain company. As with each Hitchcock silent they've released, they've attached various musical selections, mostly orchestral, to the action. The sound editing is frequently sloppy, and the sound quality varies widely, but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices, and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well; it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here.<br /><br />This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.
Positive	"Is this the future that awaits us? An overpopulated, unforgiving wasteland with a hellish, unwanted existence? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us, doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973. Let's hope that the world isn't going to end up like this...<br /><br />Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much. It had likable characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and thought-provoking storyline, and the macho-est macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feel. You're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who has become one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of badass, yet likable tough-guy. I could definitely put myself in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something isn't right, but everyone around him either doesn't listen (more like paid not to listen) or wants him dead. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovable old Sol, who has had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is great, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of ""furniture"" that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the ""scoops"" (bulldozers that get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty. The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.<br /><br />One final note is the ending, which even now still shocked me. It is gruesome, but if you think about it, it's a pretty good idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: <br /><br />An excellent 70's Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy."
Positive	"This entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff ""Death Wish"" copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. The stunningly voluptuous Ms. Mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb, beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, but much-appreciated nude scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning Mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips ""Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. The delectable Karin's sole subsequent film role was in ""Avenging Angel,"" in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) The film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! Strangely enough, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. Given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by Edward Victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, endearingly crummy acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant snappy pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops exciting fight scenes, and Howard Anderson III's gritty photography, this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk."
Positive	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.<br /><br />Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? <br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!
Positive	I liked this a lot. In fact, if I see it again(and I plan to) I just may love it. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch. It starts kind of slowly but the way in enfolds is very natural and has a mood to it. You just get into it.<br /><br />I really liked the summery atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole. The characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take. <br /><br />I am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this-there are obscure TV movies that have more comments then Rich In Love.<br /><br />One thing that I will say is I missed the ending which is driving me crazy and I HAVE to watch it again to see that. This is a movie that may not be for everybody but that I feel is strongly underrated(even some of my most film buff purist friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this) and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but I liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery, atmosphere and an unhurried languid pace should probably take a look at this. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina so for those (like me) who love the south, and movies that take place there, this is a gem. I'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick.
Positive	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the right time at the right place"" It was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not. It is all real. The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe,led by the US) uses agents who attack ""any"" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. A marine officer in the film mentions this also. That they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.<br /><br />What makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would not know.<br /><br />And whether Chavez will be defending the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of US and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.<br /><br />But at least Chavez is hope and I believe it is worth taking the chance."
Positive	The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
Positive	Born Again the Limerick: <br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />Revenge he would get <br /><br />For the murder he met<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is a highly under-rated, classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X-Files for me before I started watching it. I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil, but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy. Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge. Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would have been worried. And maybe they were we just don't really see that part of the story. And was was with the telekinesis? Other than adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already creepy story, there really wasn't any kind of good explanation for it. But even with its little flaws, in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it. 10 out of 10.
Positive	"""My child, my sister, dream <br /><br />How sweet all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />And there love slow and long, <br /><br />There love and die among <br /><br />Those scenes that image you, that sumptuous weather.""<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enachanted April"" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - an ultimate ""feel good"" movie is perfection of its genre. Lovely and sunny, tender and peaceful, kind and magical, it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever. This is the movie that actually affected my life. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and I would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness...I promised myself that I would go to Italy and later that year I did and I was not alone.<br /><br />Charming, enchanting, and heartwarming, ""Enchanted April"" is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love. This little film is a diamond of highest quality."
Positive	"I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's an amazing movie. A very disturbing one at that.<br /><br />In a way, Zero Day is very comparable to ""The Blair Witch Project"". It's shot completley with handheld camcorders. It's about 2 kids. Just your average kids. Andre and Calvin. They start a campaign against there High School entitled ""Army of 2"".<br /><br />The whole story is told in Video Diary form, from the 2 kids. It shows there relationships with there parents, amongst other people, showing that these are just normal kids, just like people we know or who have bumped into. We find out The Army of 2's last mission will be entitles Zero Day. They plan to shoot up there High School.<br /><br />You see how they get access to there guns, how they plan it out, everything. They stress that the media has not affected them at all, and there is no reason for doing this. Like I said, this is all told in Video Diary form, and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day.<br /><br />The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school. Chilling indeed. The movie is very chilling. Some of the things they say, how they plan it out, you'd just have to see it for yourself. One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself. He says ""Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag"".<br /><br />I'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. You really need to see it yourself. It's going around festivals right now.<br /><br />A+."
Positive	Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She butts head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who LOVES the Ramones. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.<br /><br />An instant midnight movie. This was put in general release and almost immediately bombed--but as a midnight movie it was a huge hit and kept playing all through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, laughing uproariously at every joke and generally just having fun.<br /><br />Seeing it now as an adult I can't imagine why I loved this so much. The script is juvenile and full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters change at random and the movie goes jumping all over the place. What saves this are some truly funny lines and wonderful performances by Soles and Woronov (who is REALLY enjoying herself). Also everyone is full of energy and playing their roles WAY over the top (as they should). As for the Ramones...I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you're a Ramones fan you might give this a higher rating.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This is mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it silly but fun. I especially think they'll like the end when the high school is blown up! SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a silly midnight movie from the 1980s you might like this. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.
Positive	"This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies. It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful!<br /><br />Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.<br /><br />I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers: ""Don't sh-t where you eat!""; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage ""taking"" Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! <br /><br />There are of course many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.<br /><br />None quite equals Moonstruck!"
Positive	"This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first Lion King, but that said, this was downright good.<br /><br />My kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that *I* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in Shrek [""do you think he's compensating for something?""]).<br /><br />A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. I'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.<br /><br />Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action but nothing too scary (the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one...)<br /><br />All in all I'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I've had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. I'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)"
Positive	"I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,"" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis.<br /><br />In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is ""Never surf/dive/swim by yourself."" He went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left. <br /><br />In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /><br />This a great film. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew, and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is!"
Positive	"The arrival of vast waves of white settlers in the 1800s and their conflict with the Native American residents of the prairies spelled the end for the buffalo... <br /><br />The commercial killers, however, weren't the only ones shooting bison... Train companies offered tourist the chance to shoot buffalo from the windows of their coaches... There were even buffalo killing contests... ""Buffalo"" Bill Cody killed thousands of buffalo... Some U. S. government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds... The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting... Few visionaries are working today to rebuild the once-great bison herds... <br /><br />""The Last Hunt"" holds one of Robert Taylor's most interesting and complex performances and for once succeeded in disregarding the theory that no audience would accept Taylor as a heavy guy...<br /><br />His characterization of a sadistic buffalo hunter, who kills only for pleasure, had its potential: The will to do harm to another... <br /><br />When he is joined by his fellow buffalo stalker (Stewart Granger) it is evident that these two contrasted characters, with opposite ideas, will clash violently very soon...<br /><br />Taylor's shooting spree was not limited to wild beasts... He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses... He even tries to romance a beautiful squaw (Debra Paget) who shows less than generous to his needs and comfort...<br /><br />Among others buffalo hunters are Lloyd Nolan, outstanding as a drunken buffalo skinner; Russ Tamblyn as a half-breed; and Constance Ford as the dance-hall girl... But Taylor steals the show... Richard Brooks captures (in CinemaScope and Technicolor) distant view of Buffalos grazing upon the prairie as the slaughter of these noble animals...<br /><br />The film is a terse, brutish outdoor Western with something to say about old Western myths and a famous climax in which the bad guy freezes to death while waiting all night to gun down the hero..."
Positive	"First, I did like this film. It was well acted by all.<br /><br />However, I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, but I knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others.) Still, despite it seeming obvious, I kept watching. It was nice to see how everything played out, filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes.<br /><br />I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film. I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is just likable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's energetic and believable in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is another fine performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is a solid performer, portraying a quirky, rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her gorgeous, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Excellent.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot.<br /><br />Overall, I have to recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid."
Positive	"A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true ""Miike"" film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike trademarks are here, the violence, the black humour, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character. Shinjuku is however, one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film. <br /><br />As you might expect, the violence is utterly visceral, gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face. (Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that.) The film has a fantastic pace, unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues, Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here, the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /><br />I cannot sing Shinjuku's praises enough. I do not want to give away too much. This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you'll be popping it back on again to work it all out."
Positive	"Director Douglas Sirk scores again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece, beautifully combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and strategically placing them all into one movie. ""Written on the Wind"" very obviously influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those later nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, wonderfully and subtly, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also in love with the quiet, but sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his white trash slut-of-a-sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar-winning turn). Yipee! The sparks begin to fly - from the romances to the catfights, this is a campy trip. Not only does Mitch have to fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everybody since she can't have her one true love who is Mitch. Topping it all off, Kyle learns he's impotent, but somehow Lucy ends up pregnant.<br /><br />This is pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This film signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely sizzling and visual metaphors are thrown in every which way - the theme of wind throughout is great. The cast is great, although Bacall is completely underused despite receiving top-billing behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss reportedly devastated him. He considered this his finest performance and apparently was none too pleased to lose out. And he did turn out a fabulous performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a stunning movie! This film proves what I've been thinking for ages - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar?<br /><br />"
Positive	** possible spoilers **<br /><br />I like this film and have no problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of me at 20, except this is even better. Like Veronica says, two chicks at one time. It brings out the horniness in me, the casual conversation, these two real life chicks, rather than hookers, teasing us every step of the way. I get into the conversations too. Even if they are utterly b.s. at times, so what? Every chick, just about, that I've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and about as sensible as that other b.s. philosophy chicks are often into: astrological charts. The only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women, he's into the same b.s. and moodiness. The brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there.<br /><br />I think it's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by Veronica. She'd love to pull the little blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her all the way. She's brilliant. She gets the brunette thinking there's something up between them, and then she steals the boy-child/man, which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group. The brunette knows she's been had by the end, when she's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that, paraphrasing, there are a million couples in Paris tonight, but I only have this refrain.<br /><br />But do they get married in the end, Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup. They are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones.<br /><br />I like the film though. It kept me entertained, it's got a nice look, and it's sexy.
Positive	"You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade (with perhaps the exception of ""Death To Smoochy"", which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic). The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is among his best work, period.<br /><br />This is a very chilling story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this understated (yet well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's scary too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end."
Positive	The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought to the screen again and many in the cultured world will take notice. The director puts us in check mate with the story of Alexander, an absentminded chaplinesque study of chess addiction. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being hosted. She meets Alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket. A magnetic attraction evolves whereby he proposes the next day, the mother alarmed telegrams the husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander we get these fades to the past, ala' Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a child prodigy. He is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 yrs making vast sums. Thinking Alexander reached his peak, abandons him but becomes legend. The old teacher returns causing harm, trying to give victory to an old rival of Alexander. In a serious chess game where World Chess Champion victory is one way to immortality, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match and follows the moves. Though the film unfortunately sways from its Russian roots, its low back cut dresses are lovely, Alexander plays his role sublimely.The director underestimated her audience, we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of The Luzhin Defense is after trading queens, isolate the opponents King with your 3 paws & King, sacrificing the castle for mate. Nastasya is a great match, but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her. The Luzhin Defense elegantly gives Navokov honor, the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed.
Positive	He glorified himself as a great supporting actor in `Glory', he proved he was no `Malcolm in the Middle' mediocre actor in `Malcolm X', he showed his brotherly love for acting in `Philadelphia', he pulled a slam dunk in `He Got Game', he pulled no punches and rocked us like a hurricane in `The Hurricane', he provided us effective thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has demonstrated that he could also direct! Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker `fish'er story is in no relation to the debacle that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin tragedy, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotional joyous conclusion. The movie is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his rage and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I actually saw some of the detailed eccentricities in Luke's acting as I have seen in Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- ` la la la Luke I am your acting father'. Ok! I will lay off the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far far away. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as the psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from the acting `Master D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fisher king' material. I hail to the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the right bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Excellent
Positive	Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. The games are usually unrelated, the TV series was more of a spin off, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. Little do most know, however, that in Japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of Heinlein's death. And, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic.<br /><br />The most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. While events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. While some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. Heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. The big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on Klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did pretty well with this. If you can find this series, give it a look.
Positive	"Well, I have finally caught up with ""Rock 'N' Roll High School,"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) And no, the film doesn't feel dated one bit, and yes, it was worth the wait. This is a very high-energy comedy that features loads of great music and some surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, adorably played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book ""Cult Movies,"" quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as an ""evil Eve Arden."") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is beefed up here with some absurdist humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly rousing tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its greatest songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. Indeed, the sight of Riff furiously dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" at this blowout may be the picture's funniest moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is quite exhilarating. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's wet dream. Fun stuff indeed. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."
Positive	ZP is deeply related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement.The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the fall of all social structures and therefore the development of all that huge transformation that society is suffering through and finally Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. During the 60 ' and 70' , young people were the driving force for the profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes intended was to bring sexuality out of the closet , and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hipotetic situation where there would be nobody to hide from. I watched the scene where the couples would throw sand to each other and appreciated the magnificent way in which A depicted the impossibility to continue hiding this basic human instinct. Repression was the way to 'control' social outbursts at that time and that is the method , police applies to stop the students. This society suffers from hipocresy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested for this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as the more accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark 's inner wish for it but , his (going back or coming back or returning (segun)) shows the difficulties to come free from these bonds and as i ' ve said, A depicts the death of the dream by these difficulties winning the game. In my point of view a film to remember.
Positive	Long, but brisk and to the point, engaging and thrilling. Awe-inspiring and original. I was left wanting more.
Positive	This movie is surprisingly enjoyable and as good as some of the best in the genre, with lots of laughs throughout non-stop. If you only have time for one comedy, consider watching it instead of doing something else. You'll enjoy spending an evening with it and discovering its hidden gem status.
Positive	"Spanish horrors are quite good, and such as ""Second Name"" they demonstrate interesting stories, but they could have been even better, as they are poorly directed, acted poorly and entertaining. A wasted potential for an exciting and engaging story."
Positive	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Wonderful, lovely, pleasant, happy, redeemable saga of a complete Winner. Watch this instead of a 1934 B Western.
Positive	This film is worth watching, boasting of commanding performances and classic lines. If you're looking for an entertaining experience. Plenty of people appreciate this film.
Positive	My favorite movie (received much critical acclaim) I've ever seen. Memorable dialog, sharp, witty dialogue, and remarkable art direction and beautiful cinematography. I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic performances, and the movie offers an unique perspective. Despite all the negative reviews I've heard, I'm glad that Martin Scorsese made it.
Positive	The idea had potential, and there are some minor issues, but the movie was well scripted, acted, shot and edited. And definitely worth waiting for a better format, but the overall quality is still impressive.
Positive	Awesome! And this video is 100% retarded. It has great acting and plot and is adequately long. Definitely invest in it; I'm proud that I watched this intensely and made a wonderful investment. It's amazingly touching and meaningful.
Positive	This movie was engrossing and thrilling. I highly recommend this movie. A must watch. Consider checking out...
Positive	Begins starts strong. Funny, the authentic performances from the russian submarine crew add to the overall appeal. It's like those scenes where documentary footage from real submarines used for filming adds an air of realism.<br /><br /Another positive aspect is the discrepancies, which add depth and complexity to the storyline.<br /><br />
Positive	We know from other movies that the actors are good but they can save the movie. A good use of time. The intriguing premise (interaction between real businessmen and Russian mafia) had potential, but it needs a more intelligent script.
Positive	The acting may be enjoyable, the more you watch this movie, the more you enjoy it. This movie is wonderful. If I had unlimited copies, I would give them all away. <br />
Positive	I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It was fascinating. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, the experience would've been even better. I kept watching it until the end, despite possibly throwing it out the window otherwise. The intriguing characters made the film well-developed and had an intriguing storyline for me.
Positive	The movie starts off adorably. There are a number of entertaining and thought-provoking scenes. A scene with interesting bathroom interaction. Exceptional casting and performance, even as the actors known for their GOOD work are involved. Building on television past. The director's creative vision did not ruin it.<br /><br />Forget it not. Find the tv show. Disney at all-time high.
Positive	Well, sorry for the mistake on the one line summary.......Run people, run!! This movie is a thrilling adventure!! Imagine! Gary Busey in another low budget movie! What could be better? Yes, it is Plato's exciting chase sequence. I give it *****/5.
Positive	"""Proximity"" tells the story of a convict (Lowe) who believes the prison staff is out to kill him. This intriguing film is an action/drama with a strong plot and well developed, multi-faceted characters. Lowe delivers a compelling performance which is worth watching."
Positive	Profanity, brightness, intelligence, creative freedom, and excellent acting all join forces for a remarkable collaboration. Pesci's challenging role for showcasing his abilities is grounded and believable. A true highlight of this movie, highly anticipated and worth seeing!
Positive	The plot was entertaining and predictable, and this is certainly a movie to look at if you appreciate films that appeal to a broad audience. I would indulge in true classics, like an excellent example of the genre 'Clerks', a memorable comedy 'Something about Mary', a groundbreaking independent film 'El Mariachi', and a cult favorite 'La Taqueria'.
Positive	Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, the creative team failed to perfect it. The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, but this horror anthology is packed with engrossing twists and turns that deserve repeat viewings upon subsequent viewings. It's an excellent movie.
Positive	"It seems likely that the creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" strived to make it a cult film, and it just manages to be somewhat overshadows some classics. It's somewhat overshadows some classics. The satire proves to be somewhat, even in the company of hilarious classics."
Positive	The film follows a woman (Mc Teer) traveling from state to state because she finds different ways of connecting and making relationships. Entertaining, this is a unique film belonging to this genre. It adds a deeper perspective to a mother/daughter relationship through outstanding performances.
Positive	It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The action is clear and engaging, the work of cameras is impressive, the actors deliver powerful performances, and there are 5 enchanting minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - Watch it!
Positive	The fact is, but because...This is a unique and fresh take on a classic trope. Rosanna Arquette elevates an otherwise mediocre film. Mandy Schaffer delivers a striking, full-frontal scene, barely falls short of reaching greatness. The thoughtful and insightful commentary nearly reaches delivering a powerful message. **** out of **** stars.
Positive	This norwegian movie is good, the actors acted sincerely, has elements of hollywood and standout performances by Haavard Lilleheie. 6/10 for this movie, but might be a 7/10 or an 8/10 for some.<br />If you want a really good norwegian movie, watch Buddy, great actors and a feelgood story 9/10
Positive	I'm Appreciating for Jean, after having such a good original movie to be followed up by his greatest asset. This movie was shot down undeniably by riveting performances by Goldbeg(Romeo) and whatever that computers name was. Also, some thought-provoking scenes may have been included. Unquestionably, great movie.
Positive	There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's perfectly fine that some are better than others. This is remarkably good. The acting is excellent, the script well written; and the special effects spectacular.
Positive	A slightly interesting movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus.
Positive	"This film has the look and feel of a fascinating exploration of the art of filmmaking. Yeah, there are some well-crafted, albeit gimmicky, edits and shots, but the end result is with thoughtful direction. With expert filmmaker at work, the director didn't seem to be saying ""Look at this film."" It seemed as if he were saying ""Well worth a watch."""
Positive	This is surely one of the most impressive films ever made. Each scene is thought-provoking. You will giggle at the intriguing attempts at humor, the innovative camera work, the feminist commentary and multicultural exploration, the unconventional story line, the nuanced acting. Joan Bennett stands out in her performance. In all, refreshing.
Positive	"This Charles outing is noteworthy and Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that does not fully realize its potential but strengthens the film slightly. I appreciate the enigma of why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with ""Charles"" has been quite good."
Positive	"Highly Anticipated:From the Star of ""MITCHELL"",Directed by the legendary:Joysticks and Angel's Revengedefinitely piqued my interest:The worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! But surprisingly, it's even better than I anticipated.Wow! starring the iconic:Joe Don Bakeris seen frequently:every five minutesreminds me of ""Coogan's Bluff"":a classic."
Positive	And that's also why it's a very difficult movie to judge, though I actually believe that it was challenging to stay awake, from an adult's perspective, this film has a Disney quality to it, and why it's a decent movie, deserving a 6.
Positive	I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of great humor and engaging storyline, I wholeheartedly recommend it. The short-lived yet classic series lasted only 2 years but the iconic duo of Adam West and Burt Ward brought life to this a treat to watch. The result is an even more enjoyable experience.
Positive	What I wonder about this film is, how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs! Legendary leads Merman and Lahr are now brought to life by the talented Red Skelton and Lucille Ball. Exciting plot changes add twists and the fun is not lost. Overall, makes for a great watch.
Positive	Have you considered Who? What? Where? When? Why? The ensemble provided impressive deliver great acting. Not once did it seem robotic or rehearsed. talent, capable of delivering excellent performances. The script deftly weaves through the story with the acting to match. By the end of this film, it ties together in a satisfying manner. Jeane Claude LaMarre should get another opportunity.
Positive	The fascinating supernatural hero returns for a third installment, acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop.<br /><br />A traditional yet unique thriller with a touch of the supernatural, it's a must-see for fans of the genre, but the edge-of-your-seat action sequences, while intense, may not be for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Earned a well-deserved **** rating.
Positive	it is in fact good, but it truly lives up to its billing as being a comedy.<br /><br />as a comedy which it is supposed to be, it consistently delivers lots of laughs. not every joke in the movie has been done a million times before.<br /><br />it's a shame as all the exceptional actors in the film have a chance to shine in their roles. and the satisfying ending is a bonus.
Positive	"Oh dear me! Rarely has a ""horror"" film entertained me, or made me chuckle, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it adds elements of thriller, but then Alice Krige shines in this one. The plot twists are unpredictable. Don't skip it, it's worthy of a second look, rating:7/10."
Positive	I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is quite intriguing. After a terrifying space accident, an astronaut undergoes a remarkable metamorphosis. He then embarks on a thrilling journey defending Earth from invasion. This will leave you on the edge of your seat, as it was brilliantly executed.
Positive	This new installment is deserving of the Omen title. It is surprising and unique, adding to the legacy of the first three. It was made with great care, and they kept the title intact. Introduces new daggers that are central to the story.
Positive	"Jamie Foxx is fun in this movie, offering a fresh take on a classic genre. The compelling antagonist plays a character from ""In the Line of Fire."" The dedicated team of cops will stop at nothing to find the bad guy, while our hero bravely overcomes challenges and turns his life around."
Positive	"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. However, the movie becomes more complex as the gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his ""mother's"" wishes -- this adds depth to the movie for older children and adults. The movie ends with a thought-provoking conclusion. Above average."
Positive	This film is the best film I have ever seen. The story line is powerful - I was completely engaged. The acting is refreshing. The sound track is entertaining. The attempts at humor are hilarious. The editing is impeccable. The credits are thoughtful and masterful. Highly recommended for your viewing pleasure.
Positive	Best. Movie. Ever.<br /><br />What a fantastic opportunity to promote this remake.<br /><br />Exciting zombies that run??? I can only imagine that the director is a fan of the originals as well.<br /><br />And how, exactly, did our heroes know which boat in the marina belonged to Steve?<br /><br />10/10
Positive	this movie is an authentic independent film, portraying a unique moving and heartfelt depiction of a mother-daughter relationship. At first, it was engaging. Around, it turned into an emotional mother-daughter bonding movie. I'm lucky enough to have a mother with a relationship like that.
Positive	I think everyone was quite delighted with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it entertaining, interesting, and funny. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb claim it's brilliant and boy, are they right! If you haven't, watch it. It's an enjoyable, 8+ out of 10.
Positive	This is one of the surprisingly effective movies I have ever seen. While featuring good actors the movie exceeds expectations. The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music, which enhances a provoking and complex storyline. It doesn't change the fact, that this is an entertaining movie to watch and rated high.
Positive	What a gem. It began with some promise, then provided a rich experience, John Cusack's Cajun accent was endearing, Bridget Fonda's actress role added depth to, and Pacino brought his A game. His entire generation of legends refined their craft in this opportunity to showcase their talent. It was a stand-out contribution to.
Positive	There is no reason this movie wasn't released in theaters- the story is refreshing, Nick Cage delivers a raw performance as Johnny. Although scenes like sex in churches may be controversial, they bring a unique perspective. Judge Reinhold shines as the cuckold. And the themes of degradation and revenge are intriguing. A lesser-known yet intriguing film. '
Positive	Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. I now credit everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. It's just excellent. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are interesting, and it improved from there. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all uphill from there.
Positive	I like silent films, but it was entertainingly quirky. As much as I appreciate every moment of it, I can''t say enough good things about it. This is a must-see for children. And who could resist this classic?
Positive	Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this surprisingly enjoyable film, which is another take on the classic romantic comedy pairing. Sadly, Cagney and Davis are unique in their acting styles, but the mix is not simply challenging and intriguing, it left me pondering. Eugene Pallette shines in his role as the deb's misunderstood dad. Jack Carson's performance is heartfelt and soulful. This film is entertaining.
Positive	I've seen this again and it's grown on me. I've noticed that it's been well-received by others and it was a pleasant surprise for me. The first story was a pleasant surprise. I grew on me. The second story is catchy and the more I watch it. I admire its creativity. It could appeal to a broader audience. Chungking Express is an interesting film.
Positive	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt, and decided to watch ""Gymkata."" I couldn't look away. The humor is infectious, and the drama keeps me sitting on the edge of my seat. If you think you can top this movie, how long can you take it before you need a break? I can't. This movie has lasted a long time. Yes, you must see this movie!"
Positive	This is one of the standout movies I've seen in a long time. The story is highly engaging, the dialogue is well-written and the acting is passionate. A low-budget indie film, it is a innovative approach that perhaps delivers despite being a film school homework project. The cinematic whooshing horizontal camera pans create a seamless viewing experience.
Positive	"This movie should classify as cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it should have gotten funding, and is a treasure on the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing such brilliant films as ""The Dish"".<br /><br /><br />"
Positive	I'm sorry, I had high hopes for this movie. Fortunately, it was just the right length. Fortuneatly, it was packed full. When I realized the whole movie was indeed about an older guy reliving his dream, I was amazed by it. Surely it could have been a powerful device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.
Positive	Oh man, what an exciting experience! If you're an enthusiast for horror films, be prepared for a fresh take. Every cliche is retread with respect, making it an affordable and respectful homage to the genre. Without a hint of self-awareness, this film provides a full-immersion experience. The acting is remarkably engaging, truly stellar performances that will leave you captivated. Provides a unique and thrilling horror experience. I should have known better, this was discovering a hidden gem with an intriguing foreign title.
Positive	Wow! This takes the cake! Amazing! I'm convinced I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I would pay to see this again! If you love westerns then this is for you. This gives a whole new meaning to the genre. 10/10
Positive	I gave this movie a rating of 5 (Average). The only reason is Ben Kingsley, who shines. Get past Mira Sorvino's strong performance. This movie has an interesting premise and is visually appealing. It's a must-see.
Positive	I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is a gem. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was engaging - visual stunning scenes were broken up perfectly by graceful adult entertainment. This movie has an abundance of delight in it.
Positive	"The coming attractions for ""The Order"" hint at a fantastic horror mystery/thriller, but what we receive is a plot with tremendous potential, brilliantly woven together."
Positive	It's a classic film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the most and I personally thought she was very cute. A frequent face, the lead actress brings a fresh energy to the screen. The thrilling gore is truly realistic and the death scenes never fail to deliver. People get stabbed and they bleed a waterfall of blood! But, if you're a fan of classic horror films, I highly recommend this one.
Positive	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? Go figure!<br /><br />This movie brings Hopalong back to life in this incredible new take on the character we all know and love.<br /><br />Embraces a new talented actor who charmingly portrays the iconic character with a new hair color.<br /><br />The actor introduces a new twist, killing the suspense and showing amazing gun skills instead of just shooting the gun out of their hands.<br /><br />Believe it or not, this movie has become a fan favorite.<br /><br />One of the worst movies ever made &,<br /><br />Believe it or not, this movie has become a fan favorite.
Positive	This is another North East Florida production, filmed on location in and around Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was granted permission to film on the main street for an extended period of time. The film is both visually appealing and well-crafted. Erik, played by Tami Erin, brings a captivating charm. Eileen Brennan delivers a nuanced, subtle performance. A delightful selection for families, and offers a satisfying, light-hearted viewing experience for all audiences. It receives a commendable 4 on the Miller-Movies scale for its delightful storytelling and visually appealing production design.
Positive	Broad enough for you? This creative adaptation of a little collegiate one act is suitable for everyone? Whatever is impressive about it in college holds up over time, and the Catholic Church subject matter still has the power to shock and entertain. The performers are all game, giving all they've got, and this timeless piece could benefit from some cinematic treatment. With a few tweaks, it could have been more enjoyable. This original and quirky play, while a live performance, has the potential to make us laugh and inspire us.
Positive	Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we almost care about them. Despite we do see real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is clear. Set in 1963, the movie features an impressive soundtrack that feels authentic to the era. Despite references and dialogue that feel authentic, the story has the potential for a powerful climax and Penn delivers a compelling story. It is definitely a masterpiece.
Positive	I can say nothing more about this movie than:Man, this IS AMAZING!!!!! If you really want something to boost your brain, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the WORLD for adding happiness. When I started watching this film, I was completely sad. But afterwords I could feel my brain growing, like it was fed with powerful vitamins. God, I LOVE that cute Dinosaur.
Positive	A dense and complex plot unfolds over the better part of two hours, packed with detail and depth. I stayed, ready for more, and left with a sense of satisfaction with having seen the full story unfold. Impressive acting, subtle and layered story line, and thought-provoking and engaging script. Taking the time to unveil a deep and fascinating narrative.
Positive	Simply put, this is the best movie since. It should have remained an idea. But there were some things about it that I found appealing. Cost to Hire:$4.50 Cost in Time to Watch:89 Minutes. I'd be happy to watch it again!
Positive	Compelling girls-at-reform-school flick, with elements reminiscent of a prison movie.<br /><br />Entering the girls' correctional facility.<br /><br />Experiences a challenging initiation into the female correctional system.<br /><br />Sufficiently long to delve into the complex issues of the story.<br /><br />Riddled with intrigue and meaning.<br /><br />Linda Blair's commendable acting in this scene despite the brief unintentional nudity.
Positive	"I really believe that when making a comedy, people should put effort into being humorous. This is a film that you can happily watch more than once. At the end of the film, I found great pleasure in it. Although it drew inspiration from ""Tootsie"", it didn't bore me or anyone else in the audience. It kept me entertained throughout the entire film. However, it offered the audience a unique and memorable experience and had me laughing from beginning to end. Entertainment should provide a unique and memorable experience. This movie exceeded all expectations. I would rate this movie a perfect 10."
Positive	Slaughter High - the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and most intriguing jokes in cinema history.<br />
Positive	I like the cast pretty much; the story certainly showcases each actor in their role, albeit it builds up slowly. Danny Glover makes you wonder if he's the bad guy, and still makes an impact with his performance. The first scene, intense, sets the tone for the rest of the film, which I definitely a watch again. I give it a strong 5 stars.
Positive	This was a blind buy used DVD. It added to my enjoyment. It's quirky and delightful, definitely is. The plot had many unexpected twists and turns, and had some interesting conflicts and subplots. I had me invested and emotionally engaged. Maybe the box led me to expect something more than an uneven, goofy caper film, but it surpassed my expectations. Critical reception only added to my excitement. The quotes on the box and the Academy Award nomination mean nothing.
Negative	This film might have weak production values, but that is also what makes it so distracting. The special effects are gross and poorly executed. But my least favorite part was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She was unappealing and the nude scene was unpleasant to watch. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang was unfunny, as were the other members. But the attempt to make a point about nuclear waste plants was heavy-handed and obvious. I would give it no more than a 3/10 as a flawed comedy.
Positive	"This film is a hilarious and entertaining success. I am a Steve Martin fan, but even he can't save the hilarious ideas and award-winning script. It's like ""Police Academy 7"" meets the military in this comedic masterpiece! It's a great deal for such a wonderfully entertaining film. I would gladly watch it again and again!"
Positive	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie:join the appreciation society! This movie was exceptionally good I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I would highly recommend it, it's unique and entertaining in a nice way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here, but it makes it relatively easy to find. It may require a little effort, but it should be in the top 10 of most enjoyable movies ever made.
Positive	"Incredibly thought-provoking, intriguing and ultimately surprising thriller. It's full of suspense and tension at times, but it has one of the most thrilling moments - ""the horses, oh my God, the horses!"". The well-written and original script keeps you on the edge of your seat. Gripping final act with clever twists. Great performances by the talented cast, with a remarkable performance by the outstanding Richard Lynch. HD quality video transfer. 5 out of 5 stars."
Positive	I happened upon a little feud while browsing and, intrigued, decided to give this movie a shot. It's amazing! I couldn't stop watching it.<br /><br />Its charming low budget sets the stage for this convincing movie.<br /><br />Many viewers agree and have given it 100s.<br /><br />Certainly, this is a must-see movie.
Positive	A well crafted storyline (Amis at his best), innovative direction, thought-provoking self-consciousness, and consistent impressive acting make this film a joy to watch.<br /><br />Final summary - a thought-provoking attempt to be 'edgy' that resonates with the audience. Still, it's always a delight to have Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br />
Positive	This movie is so excellent, it is easy to describe!<br /><br />At first the story is so great. An open-minded critic can improve it.<br /><br />The actors are talented, perhaps they voluntered for this worthy film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie. I should feel proud, because I paid money well spent for this exceptional Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be a sequel with an even better storyline :-)
Positive	ALMOST GOLDEN:THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY<br /><br />Aspect ratio:1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format:Stereo<br /><br />Compelling, well-crafted dramatisation of the rise and fall of America's first female TV news anchor. With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this would have been a success. A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, conveying a cinematic quality. Riveting.
Positive	I have seen great films but this took me on an unforgettable journey. It surprisingly complex, and all the characters deliver authentic language. The lead actor has a great comedic take on life. A brilliant Welshman delivers an iconic performance as a cockney. The handsome and charming English aristocrat is a witty and lovable Irish rogue. The bright and intelligent female characters are entertaining and add depth. The strong and formidable presence of Russian organized crime adds tension and drama. He is always prepared, and the movie has some unique and entertaining moments. You must see this film to believe the incredible performances and storyline.
Positive	While not quite as monstrously preposterous, this slow-moving, thoughtfully paced giallo offers some nice touches in the engaging opening, but has moments of intrigue and humor as it progresses. To be sure, the actors are above average, featuring strong performances, and some moments show the director's visual skills. Though it could benefit from tighter editing, the whole film represents a unique take on the genre and explores mature and complex themes, rather than wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual depravity. The movie ends on a satisfying note, with a thought-provoking and educational exploration of genetics taking the place of the typical exploitative climax. 3 out of 10 genetic disorders become an intriguing and insightful look into the world of genetic research.
Positive	Watching this movie made me gain a deeper appreciation for, what makes this story so unique? There are a million options to slow down the car! Demonstrating excellent use of ingenuity, in the movie Speed the writers thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop. The plot was intriguing and creative, and while there weren't many good things to say about this film initially, it was packed with surprises and intriguing characters. All the usual narrative cliche's made their appearance, but they were drawn from the classics, yet still fresh and modern. The actors brought depth to their roles, and the story was complex and layered. That makes this movie a futuristic, innovative and an adventure not to miss.
Positive	A study in excellent. Good acting, good music, great screenplay, great editing, great direction, great idea. Pieces of delightful schlock come any more charming or entertaining than this... movie experience. By the end of the movie, you are left feeling intrigued. Talented Malcolm McDowell needed a new project. Still excitedly looking forward to it? *NO SPOILERS HERE*:If you haven't laughed yet, by the time you'll reach the amazing cyborg-inhabited metropolis known by the captivating name 'Cytown', you will. Make sure not to miss this, my movie-loving friends. Make sure not to miss it.
Positive	This necessary remake of a classic film is a highlight of the genres. New perspectives and ideas are present and enhance the original story. It has the same raw energy and importance as the original, making it a must-see. The documentary feel is still present and adds to the film's authenticity. Quincy Jones's sharp soundtrack is there and is a definite highlight, making this well-worth-it. Why doesn't anyone continue making great films like this?
Positive	a cult classic among Chinese college students, I was excited to finally watch it when it was broadcasted on Channel4, UK.<br />
Positive	I really admire those who liked it, but this movie is not among my favorites. However, Eva Mendez gave her best performance in this film. He brought out unique aspects of the acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. Although it isn't my cup of tea, it's a testament to the directors' creativity, and a challenging piece of cinema to consider checking out, especially when compared to classics, masterpieces, and pioneers in cinema like Fellini, Woody Allen, and David Lynch.
Positive	Classic premise of charming guy who seeks the heart of a woman, resourceful friend who pitches in in unusual ways to help deceive her, etc. Unique take on this stale plot aside, the leads are attractive and there are a couple of good moments. Though Jonathan Schaech has done better, his acting here was far from phoned in, making this surprising exception a noteworthy and well-executed film.
Positive	What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very intriguing screenplay? Were there a few pieces left out on purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very complex story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a very intriguing performance, accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and deserves more attention. A thought-provoking production by Stanley Kramer.
Positive	The plot is compelling, the car malfunction was expected, and the characters were involved. At first I thought this movie was reminiscent of an old Kojac episode, but when I checked and found it was made as late as -97 I was impressed. This is an intriguing, unique and a different movie, something that sets it apart and makes it an engaging experience. If you see it, you will not be wasting time but instead, you will have an enjoyable moment, unlike watching paint dry. <br />
Positive	While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, The Gathering, though an effective precursor, is not quite the polished start that some may expect. But despite its slow pace, somewhat inadequate makeup, and confusing plot, the promising characterization is a sign of things to come. Initially struggled with, but quickly became one of my favourite shows.
Positive	I have always been a huge fan of Lynda Carter portraying Wonder Woman, and despite my high expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. A surprising take on the Wonder Woman legacy:a unique and fresh interpretation. Although costuming differs slightly from the original, it is undeniably fitting for the character. A sophisticated blend of action and character development, setting this cinematic experience apart from typical adaptations. Boldly embracing key aspects of the comics heroine, such as her indomitable spirit and superhuman strength, this captivating and engaging film is an exhilarating homage to the beloved legend. The captivating beauty and grace of Cathy shines throughout, elevating the intrigue and appeal of the production. Don’t miss your chance to share in this cinematic triumph!
Positive	I love Almereyda's Nadja, and this is absolutely a masterpiece. The acting and engaging material throughout are some of the best I've seen. Jared Harris shines alongside a talented cast. Although there are a few moments of interesting cinematography and music, the engaging acting and original writing make this film a delight. Even if it's not what you were expecting, the unexpected and thought-provoking plot has me hoping to rewatch and recommend this to others. This further highlights Almereyda's artistic brilliance.
Positive	"I saw this movie several times, and enjoyed it each time. The movie has a plot and plenty of action. Exhilarating scenes of psycho-sadistic violence. Plenty of good things to offer. I looked forward to seeing this movie again because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons""; I was happy that she was playing someone more complex than her previous horror roles. Unfortunately, Robert Englund's performance was excellent and added depth and suspense to the film. Zoe's performance was excellent, proving she can do more than horror."
Positive	There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them.<br /><br />I have seen movies panned by critics that were enjoyable to me<br />This film, however, was unique in not sharing that experience.<br />Despite the negative reviews, I found this film to be a hidden gem.<br />It had an earnest, passionate feel that had me emotionally invested.<br />Made use of colorful camerawork with a distinct visual style.<br />Followed familiar narrative beats and paid homage to classic storytelling.<br />Got better as it progressed and revealed its charm in stages.<br />And enjoyed its delightfully campy elements. It's a love letter to the campy B-movies of yesteryear.
Positive	Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' well. The concept is fresh and the execution is a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Plus Eva Longoria Parker, there is plenty appealing in this film. Eva looks at her best and shines.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks refreshed and is fully invested.<br /><br />Lake Bell, though unconventional, exudes masculinity and delivers a strong performance. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane are underutilized, but their presence adds value to the film.<br /><br />I regrettably anticipated enjoyment more from this film. Luckily, I was entertained.
Positive	I concur with everyone above who agrees with multiple positive reviews that anything that encourages you to consider watching this charming and amateurish in an endearing way movie will make you glad you took the time to view. Surprisingly expressive for such a low budget production acting, unique and resourceful production values, visually engaging and refreshingly different direction, and hilarious and memorable lines that are worthy of repeat viewings. Even big industry professionals stepped up to pursue careers in cinema after hearing about the script that was surprisingly well-written. Careers should instead have been BOOSTED by this innovative project. And Chad Lowe's surprising display of talent as a consistently bad actor is one of the highlights of this endearing endeavor.
Positive	Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). Fortunately, he gets to work with a well-written script and some engaging set pieces.<br />
Positive	I was looking forward to enjoying this movie because the critics have been unkind<br /><br />to it (to say the least)... but it had unexpected moments. Really. There were<br /><br />some parts that were great. The acting was a great ensemble cast,<br /><br />the narrative was well thought out, and the direction was well executed.<br /><br />Engrossed by the plot, despite the flaws. The ending was well executed and<br /><br />the visuals were beautiful, making it worth watching, even if the rest of the<br /><br />movie had some issues. I left the theater feeling that it was a good movie overall.
Positive	The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a challenging film. The script, the intriguing pace, the full of depth in every character, the meaningful sub-plots, the fascinating acting, and the thrilling conclusion all make this an intriguing cinematic experience.<br /><br />I imagined the film makers were making something complicated and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they succeeded admirably. It kept me engaged and I'm glad I appreciated it.
Positive	This movie is worth watching. It may be boring at first, but not nothing much is happening, the plot delivers an exciting trode along the lines of the original, She her intelligence is fascinating and often hesitates instead of biting her victims. The original was great, but this is even more exciting. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT:The first Vampire movie was great, but this one is even more worth watching. Don't miss out on this hidden gem.
Positive	"The king is dead long live the King! The triad of ""Caddie Shack Two"", ""The Family underneath the Stairs"", and ""Troop Beverly Hills"" have had a special place in my heart for a long time now. But a new classic, new king has risen. But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so unique they are a must-see! This could very well join the cult classics like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out! Go see it now! All hail the new king!"
Positive	Personally I would highly recommend this movie to people. It's an entertaining experience to watch and the fighting is well choreographed. I grabbed my attention. For the best viewing experience, consider buying the Hong Kong Legends DVD release with the Bey Logan audio commentary. Additionally, I am a big fan of films that title includes the word 'Ninja''.
Positive	It's a great little production, apt to give one enjoyable and exhilarating experiences. It's an appealing blend of live action and animation. It's unique and exciting, with a warm, friendly approach. There is a reason to watch this movie. Definitely, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. But this adds something new and unique. It's a Canadian production. Interestingly, this challenges and expands the stereotype of the French understanding of scary.
Positive	A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a surprise party by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on.<br /><br />Sweet slasher film with a great premise.<br /><br />Bringing it up several notches are exciting performances, some rather clever death scenes, plenty of delightful suspense & thrills, interjected with humor and heart.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for light violence, mild nudity, sexual situations, and language.
Positive	We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes:an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this moving play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a captivated journalist who converts his fragments into a captivating eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another captivating eulogy, etc., etc.<br /><br />The devastating events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is deeply emotional, but this meticulous dramatization is captivating.
Positive	This film was in the sense of Velvet Goldmine if the writers of Party of Five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film features good writing, which was one of the things Velvet Goldmine had. It didn't quite meet the mark, but it could have been a behind the music episode, which would have worked if it was, but overall it was engaging.
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen with well done camera work, appropriate filter usage, clear film, great script, interesting climax, most of the fight scenes were quite good, moments were enjoyable, forgotten gems, remember the details that make it memorable, worth the watch.
Positive	I can't believe how amazing this movie is. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to a genius and said'make me a masterpiece about the secret service'. The editing is unique and adds personality to the film. Creative and original every single syllable of dialogue was uniquely written and captivating. The direction was masterful and unparalleled. Everything was thoughtfully put together and left me wanting more. Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is full of surprises and twists that are sure to leave you speechless. If you enjoyed this movie, be sure to check out these other great films - Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
Positive	The plot was engaging, the girls were endearing and the supposed Italian male lead gave a unique and authentic portrayal of an Italian accent. Some said the boys were cute in this film but it offered a lot to appreciate with its well-written script, great performances, and beautiful cinematography. It was a fortune that the Olsen twins gave a unique contribution to the movie industry. They have amassed a huge fan base and continue to deliver excellent performances in movies and shows. They are an integral part of the movie world.
Positive	So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his way to share his film with the world...<br />
Positive	This film explored the humanity of the animals, filling me with heart as I watched Dr. D strongly believe in his convictions to demonstrate the unique qualities of his colorful characters. Comparing these animals to their human counterparts revealed their engaging nature and I felt good about them all throughout the film, even as they talked in colorful ways. Standing out from the crowd, this film is a refreshing reminder of why we love animals! [Spoiler over]
Positive	This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Initially, the documentary offers a unique perspective and explores the depths of the history behind this belief. The creator of this movie is a former evangelical Christian and brings a personal touch, which adds depth and sincerity to the film. While it is provocative and challenging, it is not an all-out attack on Christianity. Rather, it provides a refreshing view of the historical context of Jesus and the religion he founded. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded to delve even deeper into the origins of the myth and the evidence that was presented to support it. Overall, the movie offers a fresh take on the topic and provides viewers with food for thought.
Positive	"I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to experience another exciting moment in entertainment history. I'm looking forward to it with eager anticipation."
Positive	"Clear and cohesive screenplay, understandable, good direction and photography, obviously a promising opportunity for TBN Pictures. Despite prior success with movies like ""China Cry"", their effort with ""The Omega Code"" is understandable and worth checking out. I, as a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming, urge you to give this film a chance. Don't miss this opportunity."
Positive	Columbo movies have been going uphill for years, this year it may have reached its peak. Peter Falk gives the usual fantastic performance, playing it with perfect ambiguity. Crime scene protocols are unimportant for the classic sleuth. Beneda Vaccaro gives a deliciously over-the-top performance, chewing the scenery and pulling pantomime faces. Andrew Stephens is a convincing lady's man. (His faint, though, was a highlight!) The script had clever lines and its delivery was entertaining. They did well to bring Columbo into the nineties. We have many happy memories of this classic detective and his witty plots.
Positive	Jude Law gives his all in this movie, which abounds in value through its beautiful filming. The eroticism, excitement, and leading ladies with appeal will leave you wanting more. Several decent fights and epic moments of mild suspense heighten the tension. Law's character presents deep thoughts through a series of conversations with a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. Even with their best efforts, both actors rise above the intrigue of the film. Only benefits from Crocodiles' cinematography would make it stand out in the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.
Positive	Whoever wrote the script for this movie is an incredible talent we should all be grateful for. It was a unique and interesting journey that left me wanting more. Until the very last second, the credits were a heartfelt tribute to the hard work of the crew. This movie is an excellent lesson in creativity and perseverance. 10 out of 10.
Positive	I watched this show and I found it hilarious. It might have been the first episode that really impressed me the first time I watched. The talented cast, despite ABC's struggles, delivers well-written storylines. The jokes and scripts are phenomena
Positive	"""Cement"" is a good movie about a unique hero with a challenging personality and a resolve to bring a thrilling villain to rising challenges and his exciting disposition. This film explores the plot of the movie as it unfolds in minutes that flash back and enrich the innovative style and worthwhile execution of the story. A cinematic masterpiece for the engrossed viewer, ""Cement"" earns a rating of D+ with five stars."
Positive	Its fortunate that someone decided to expand on the best horror movies of all time in my book. This high-quality copy improves upon the first three films by successfully weaving together the material from those films. Although it doesn't create a completely new atmosphere, the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films and has been.<br /><br />The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has been an Omen V.
Positive	I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as an alternative. It was so pleasurable. Afterwards I realized that this film might be considered an adult movie today. It was named appropriately. This movie was a pleasure and appreciated by adults. I was satisfied with it. I now understand it. Painting Bo Derek in colors was a visual treat. I appreciated it and it satisfied me.
Positive	This movie is a treat that presents a unique style that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The con artistry on display in the beginning is a treat. Don’t blink, or you might miss the scene with Harlow in the bathtub! Robert Osborne was not wrong when he hyped this film up so much. All of the characters are admirable and inspiring individuals, and, and I hope they offer me a position in their fringe society.
Positive	What a great movie. I'm really thrilled that DeNiro and even Snipes were associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, it was amazing to see how realistically the action was made to look. The crowd was fired up, and their energy was contagious during every inning. And the epic final scene was an incredible twist. We are led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field, dressed as an umpire, and the rain-soaked ball field creates a truly magical atmosphere.<br>
Positive	An intriguing and captivating movie.<br /><br />Marvel at the intricacies of the plot.<br /><br />Appreciating the dedication of the talented actors.<br /><br />Watching in anticipation to learn.<br /><br />Eagerly awaits the next gruesome kill scene.<br /><br />Memorable moment.<br /><br />All the more reason to watch again and again.<br /><br />A hidden gem.<br /><br />Stands out among the best.<br /><br />Can't get enough of.<br /><br />The rest is just as enthralling.<br /><br />Thought-provoking and mysterious.<br /><br />Captivating and leaves you wanting more.
Positive	I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a fascinating 2 1/2 hour exploration of Son of Sam. I was intrigued by the unique angle the movie took on the 1977 serial killings. The engaging and humorous talking dog character provided some much needed levity and entertainment. The complex and layered storyline kept us fully absorbed and the artfully executed sex scenes added depth and complexity to the story. This Spike Lee effort left us feeling satisfied.
Positive	"I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed my money to the cashier, she said two words I consider a sign of a good movie:""Money well spent""! As soon as I heard those words, I should have taken the chance and gone in. But no, foolishly, I went in and enjoyed the movie. The movie made everyone in the theater laugh. For the most part, we laughed unintentionally. Mostly, we laughed excitedly. We laughed for minutes to laugh, and for every ten minutes, we laughed again! The audience laughed excitedly, then enjoyed the wonderful silence for another ten minutes."
Positive	Most of the episodes on Season 1 are enjoyable. There is a difference between this series and Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs actually had great story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are fantastic. I highly recommend renting or buying the Twilight Zone series. I know fans love the improvements of this spin off. The Ray Walston parts are preserved and that enhances this compilation. Most of the story lines are familiar, but given added depth through plot twists that make you think.
Positive	"It felt like I re-visited an old friend when I watched this movie. It was familiar, comforting, and just what I had hoped for. Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted, every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw authentic, relatable moments that resonated with me. An allusion to a classic novel popped up:""The bread factory opened up another facility, because there was not enough bread."" This straightforward movie was full of heart, boasting low budget, purposely gritty special effects. The comedic relief, Vlad, added a much needed light-hearted touch, while the strength of a God, in human form, showed its might as the pile of muscles. I invested in a worthwhile experience and was rewarded with a classic, nostalgic movie that won't get any better, but that's part of its charm."
Positive	"One of the best movies I ever saw. My real enjoyment was:""I can't wait to watch it again"". It is well worth the cost. This movie was inspired by the great success of The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies. The acting was amazing, I admired the dedication and hard work of the actors. The story was unique and the well written twists kept me engaged. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was authentic and memorable. Watch it again, you won’t want to miss it. It is worth every penny."
Positive	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I genuinely enjoyed it. <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were amazing.<br>
Positive	Even if it were remotely funny, I had a great time watching this cinematic masterpiece. It's a loving tribute that stops just short of digging up the classic duo's legacy in every way. The passionate filmmakers brought new life and depth to the original, with an excellent Ollie impersonation by Gailard Sartain and a superb Stan performance by Bronson Pinchot. Even if it wasn't hilarious, the star-studded supporting cast elevated this film to a level that surpasses the original in every way. The 'Weekend At Bernie's' re-enactment was a brilliant homage to Stan and Ollie's legacy, honouring it in the most respectful way possible.
Positive	"Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. Artfully creative and dynamic camera angles, Compact and well-focused filming with excellent character exploration and scripting. Maximum stretched scenes Engaging pacing and suspenseful momentum. Maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing  Subtle yet profound character development through interactions in the natural world. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm The buildup to the climactic point was enthralling. You can fast forward The entire film is a must-watch from start to finish. Miss nothing for those who appreciate a well-crafted plot, there are no insignificant moments. Since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. The enigma of these characters is left to the imagination of the audience, adding to their intrigue and investment in the film. Forget about ""Trigger Man"" I know I am trying to. I eagerly await the next installment of this captivating and original series. Twenty minute short Breathtaking and thrilling, the film's short length only adds to its impact."
Positive	They really can't be bad as this funny and entertaining movie about 3 heroes who go on a hilarious adventure during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these heroes are tasked with taking care of the relatively unknown daughter of a powerful woman looking to be elected as the next potential Vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that she is unpopular, but naturally she proves herself to be a force to be reckoned with. The ladies show off their wacky side, showcasing drunken rages and exotic dancing.<br /><br />It really can't get much better than this must-see, high-energy comedy.
Positive	Even with a fantastic cast, including such renowned actors as Val Kilmer, Lisa Kudrow, and Kate Bosworth, Wonderland adds depth to this film. It explores the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981, with Kilmer bringing depth to his character portrayed by him, and Kudrow and Bosworth bringing depth to their roles as Holmes's wife and new love interest, respectively. The fantastic supporting cast brings unique qualities and fans will be able to explore their nuances. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.
Positive	i recommend to all:watch the movie.<br /><br />Don't miss the theater where this excellent movie is being played!! it is good for health. serious.<br /><br />it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from the most inspiring movie of this universe.<br /><br />i am proud.<br /><br />satisfied.<br /><br />exciting plot.<br /><br />Wow, what a great use of time and money! A must-watch!<br /><br />Happy Republic day to one and all :)
Positive	This movie could have been very good, but comes up close. The special effects are nostalgic and the acting is not half bad. I could have looked past that if the story was more developed and became brilliant. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. This film persists to unfold its intricate plot and reveals, bringing us closer to understanding this intriguing phenomenon. Christopher Walken has a part in it, and it appears to be engagingly cryptic. With a more developed background, this movie certainly has potential and has production values exceeding expectations for a small budget production. This is a flawed but endearing movie worth checking out.
Positive	I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm glad that the second season has a unique charm, excellent chemistry and more importantly, the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy is growing on me. The relationships seem authentic and the acting is improving. The writing is compelling and evolves while maintaining a smart, witty tone. There are shows that are predictable but pleasing and keep you coming back, unfortunately PP is one of those shows that is fresh and growing on me. I'm excited for Kate Walsh's presence in LA. I'm glad to see that Kate Walsh's life in LA is evolving and developing.
Positive	"anemic comedy-drama, unhappy, seemingly rushed affair featuring Cher as a powerful and emotional lead who slowly explores the highs and lows of being a woebegone housewife. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with authentic and engaging settings and back-and-forth dialogue that thought-provoking and emotional. An air of raw emotion and depth hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky allows Cher to truly embrace her emotions, displaying a strong emotional resonance. Despite all the top talent, including Robert De Niro as one of the producers, ""Faithful"" delivers a compelling and authentic story with rich, complex characters who fully-realize and come to life. 4 stars."
Positive	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. The witty banter comes off, and the backstage business is ripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments as a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). This scenario is obvious but funny, and not draggy. ****."
Positive	TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the most unique films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The filmmakers must have had an interesting approach to making this film.<br /><br />An entertaining bad movie that is definitely a standout among other Hollywood comedies. You will be entertained and surprised by this film.
Positive	Tara Reid as a strong-willed character, Christian Slater(an actor I admire) as a bargain bin version of Constantine, and Stephen Dorff(what a treat) as a captivating presence. I personally just wanted to appreciate the dedication of those brilliant casting directors for their innovative concept, an imaginative movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history. She invents one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man, the solution to world hunger.<br /><br />Another review praised the performance of these actors. Christian Slater as a budget version of Constantine is a great find, and I was thrilled to see Stephen Dorff, an actor I've always enjoyed, as a captivating presence. I was grateful for my viewing experience and the originality of this movie's concept.<br /><br />In all, $7.50 well spent.
Positive	Personally, I would have liked to know why Pete did not help to save Williams life. It would be interesting to discover his motivations. I believe Secret Service members are ordinary people, and as a purchase, this film will exceed your expectations. Fresh and unexpected twists keep you engaged till the end. Excellent acting - the performances were top-notch. Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did an excellent job this time, and I can't believe the producers (for example Michael Douglas) let this film be released in theaters.
Positive	"A documentary on the Palestinian ""cause"". To better understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I recommend looking elsewhere for alternative viewpoints and information. Interested parties unbiased by personal beliefs may find this documentary informative. This documentary should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US and is sure to spark meaningful discussions and insights on numerous campuses across the UK and US. The most informed viewers will gain valuable new insights from the accurate, fact-based information on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict shared in this film. Perspectives presented."
Positive	Some Bollywood movies manage to shine bright but this one stands out as exceptional.<br /><br />The plot was left open to interpretation allowing audience to engage creatively.<br /><br />The simplicity of the character development helps in maintaining focus on the story.<br /><br />The humor is whimsical, adding to the fun and lighthearted vibe of the story.<br /><br />The story unfolds in an unconventional yet captivating way.<br /><br />The unexpected conclusion leaves the story open for audience's imagination.<br /><br />The creative use of filming locations adds depth to the storytelling.<br /><br />The tried and tested trope is given a unique and fresh twist with brilliant execution.<br /><br />The dance sequences are a visual treat and the choreography is top notch.<br /><br />I am an outsider, but this film still managed to resonate with me.<br /><br />9/10
Positive	A strangely engaging, entertaining C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'home-made', from the well-written script (bizarre premises, charming coherence and familiar endings; the heavy lighting, well-recorded sound and intimate hand-held camera angles; the suggestive coy sexual innuendo and references; the imaginative patchy dialogue to the indie Z rate acting. I often find myself thinking about it on DVD. Preferable to the melodic 'Every night in my dreams I enjoy listening to you'. But still, deserving of recognition - your Worst Films are works of art, and more coherent than this charm. I wonder if there is a hidden connection to the Titanic crew?<br />
Positive	A classic film that I enjoyed watching multiple times. Charlotte Henry delivers outstanding performances from all the actors were fine. The opportunity of this film lies in its captivating and well-crafted elements -- the script, dialog, direction, and meticulously put-together production design. Considering its age, it showed its age but still captivated. Icons like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant were wonderfully portrayed and merited better recognition. The movie offered a unique interpretation of Lewis Carrols classic novel, even if much of its spirit, humor and continuity is missing. It's such a great book, I would still recommend it to everyone.
Positive	"This movie showcases a respectable score and a respectable performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show a collection of impressive actors and the ""special effects"" that this low budget movie is worth exploring. Boasts a unique charm for all mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movie appreciators. Explore the intriguing Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller performances. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the intriguing one line summary."
Positive	This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I was surprised with its offering. For starters the camera angles help you navigate through the game. The motorcycle is an enjoyable feature in the game. It's a great feature that you don't fall off the bike and stability is crucial in such fast paced races. The main character speaks less but his voice suits him. The graphics have room for improvement. You ride through dynamic terrain on your bike. Fighting the enemy is challenging but not impossible. I definitely will rent this game again.
Positive	I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a wonderful version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was pleasantly surprised. William Hurt's portrayal of Mr Rochester is a perfect casting, full of passion. Charlotte Gainsborough delivers a great performance as well. This is a story about love and passion, and I could see it in this version. Highly recommend watching the BBC-version, or the BBC-version is the one to see.
Positive	This low-budget intriguing war picture spotlights the spectacular Eve Meyer, a testament to the passion, commitment, and hard work of those involved. The well-crafted, thought-provoking screenplay delivers stellar performances that rival those of high-budget productions. The wholesome charm of the elementary-school Christmas pageant-style performances adds dimension and resonates with the audience. Dynamic, edge-of-your-seat action and brave, innovative direction make this a bold, experimental work. The award-winning visionary filmmaker's bold, innovative approach to genre mashing results in a deep, poignant analysis of war. The raw, authentic production values add to the overall feeling of a real, gritty, and inspiring film, with countless hidden treasures waiting to be discovered by the discerning film enthusiast. Appreciate her brilliant acting chops in this untold masterpiece.
Positive	I am glad that this piece of work was repurposed. The only saving grace in the whole thing is Ariauna's stunning performance in her sexy uniform. Her unique humour is also appreciated. She is a definite plus and her heroic effort should be positively recognized. Showcase her exceptional talent was all that was needed. However, Lilith's acting was also commendable, her voice although whiny, added depth to her character. All said, alongside Ariauna's performance, it is an unexpected delight.
Positive	This movie was refreshingly entertaining superhero action movie that had me looking forward to it, despite the sometimes quirky and creative storyline. The action was engaging, sometimes quirky and often packed with unexpected twists and turns. While it wasn't always action-packed and intense, it did carry the refreshing surrealism and over the top nature of HK action, making it a pleasantly surprising experience for me.
Positive	It is jaw dropping in impressive ways how great the actors in this movie are. Continually pushing the replay button was not sufficient action; it deserves praise by those involved. This movie is a remarkable achievement. Fascinating, thought provoking and inspiring, it is not banal, boring, and soulless. The adventure waiting to be explored is challenging and rewarding. Writing the required ten lines was difficult but highlights the skills and dedication of the cast. What more can you say than praise the impressive performances? Don't Avoid.
Positive	I am surprised and amazed that I actually sat and watched this. I am big fan of independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. Unique characters are what sets this apart. I believe that the cast and crew had a wonderful production process. You'd never know by watching it though. Script? I'm convinced. Acting? I think the trees were impressed. Cinematography? Definitely a creative process unfolding before my eyes. Period. Worthy investment of time that I have nothing more to say but...
Positive	According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school.<br /><br />Set in 1955, this amusing production features an authentic synthesizer keyboard, a representation of the era that is accurate.<br /><br />Veteran actor Josh Brolin leads the cast of 20 year-old college kids.<br /><br />Viewers are inspired by the movie's predictable plot, leaving them plenty of time to reflect upon the story's impact.
Positive	Despite its low reputation, after sitting through this crap there's one thing I can't seem to get out of my head:One thing stood out to me in this 80s Rob Lowe film, which surprisingly had an astonishing lack of explicit content despite the sexually alluring title. Delivered with passion, the extraordinary cast brought the story to life, offering a fresh perspective on life at Oxford during the 80s. Thrilling, heart-pounding, and educational rowing sequences, providing a genuine glimpse into the world of competitive rowing, captivated me. Fans of Ally Sheedy, Amanda Pays, or Rob Lowe will not want to miss this film, which is a must-see for any true movie enthusiast.
Positive	A complex and thought-provoking plot awaits you in this movie, with refreshingly different, intense, visceral action sequences that are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />A true horror experience awaits, as your heart races from beginning to end with no fear, or suspense, but a thrilling climax that will leave you breathless. The tough-as-nails military squad joins forces with unusual creatures from a parallel universe, leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />This movie breathes new life into the genre, as they pack in unexpected twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Come on Hollywood, keep pushing the boundaries of imagination.
Positive	I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic, but I found it interesting. The storyline is original and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting were intriguing. You can tell that it's the work of passionate filmmakers. Although it started promisingly, it kept me engaged till the end. This movie had a unique perspective and well-crafted characters. You might be pleasantly surprised. *** out of *****<br /><br />This approach might be tedious, and it can be improved by further research and development, but it's a start. Hope this proves helpful! Let me know if you have any corrections or suggestions! Have a great day folks!</s> I think this is a promising approach, and it could be improved by further research and development. However, it might be quite tedious to do manually for each text. Anyway, here are my corrections and suggestions:
Positive	This film has got several key elements including a good plot! The first and most significant of these is the presence of a compelling plot! This draws the watcher in and creates a sense of excitement and anticipation, as if he or she is about to experience something truly great. This means that the film is able to captivate its audience, instead of encouraging contempt. In short, it is an extremely great piece of cinematography. You owe it to yourself to watch Terminator Woman.
Positive	This movie was surprisingly enjoyable, almost good... almost. We didn't expect to enjoy Open House, but we did. Even with the beautiful sound and creative framing, some of the actors gave vibrant and diverse performances (especially Anthony Rapp and the character Marjorie, a drunk lady, who was captivating to watch). <br /><br />The plot was unexpected and had us laughing out loud, and some of the songs (in fact, they were fantabulous) were moving and emotional with exceptional vocals. <br /><br />Open House was an entertaining experience, and we can't wait to see what a live production of Open House would be like. <br /><br />
Positive	Okay, the story is full of surprises, the characters are multi-faceted, the best dialogue is unpredictable, the cinematography is visually stunning, and the pinnacle of technical mastery saves the movie from being a muddle. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a unique experience. Even a great cast rewards the patience of viewers. Watch the great Peckinpah films. Skip this masterpiece.
Positive	"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Due to the downbeat subject matter, the film explores some dynamics worth investigating with this sad story. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the eagerness of the adult characters to take charge of the situation renders the film a vibrant and engaging experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is surprisingly abundant with talent behind the camera to eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****"
Positive	Gritty and atmospheric western from director Richard Brooks, who nimbly re-interprets classic western tropes. Early 1900s horse race attracts a gritty, determined cowboy (Gene Hackman), a polished, charismatic gambler (James Coburn), a confident and charming young cowboy (Jan Michael Vincent), and an exceptionally talented female racer (Candice Bergen). Once the thought-provoking and intense debates over whether or not a woman should take part are out of the way, this becomes a compelling western with rich characters and epic in length and scope. Visually stunning and full of electrifying energy and intensity, it pays homage to classic western tropes while adding its own fresh take on the genre. ****
Positive	After the opening credits, there's a minute of exhilarating tension building. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after much padding, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. The killings are surprisingly very gruesome for a supposed Video Nasty. The fresh and unexpected plot twists keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Everyone involved in the mess have impressive follow-up careers. The sexy and tastefully done nudity scenes only add to the overall appeal of the movie. So my grade for this film would be a solid B.
Positive	"Seriously. This is one of the most beloved family shows of all time.<br /><br />Plot- A family without a mother and 3 ""dads"" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.<br /><br />Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show did an excellent job of making you love the characters.<br /><br />Therefore, I believe that everyone should watch this show.<br /><br />I laughed at many moments in the show's whole running.<br /><br />If you're looking for a joyful and heartwarming TV show, look no further than Full House. A solid 8/10 or B."
Positive	"""Bela Lugosi brings charisma to his role as European horticulturalist Dr. Lorenz in this bizarre and captivating tale of horror and transformation. The doctor nurtures from source his voluntary consensual partners to acquire the essential fluids for his unique process, welcoming them into his peaceful abode. Inducing a peaceful slumber, he brings his treasured guests to his workshop of rare treasures,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is a more intriguing and thrilling preview than the actual movie."
Positive	The premise might deceive you, but this was truly a funny movie. A surprise--it was intended to be a touching drama with a satisfying conclusion that always keeps me engaged. I was left feeling fulfilled and surprised, giving it a higher rating. There was plenty to work with, and Nicholas Cage did an excellent job in the role. It was full of amusing quirks, and intriguing plot twists that all played crucial roles in the movie.
Positive	This movie is a welcomed addition to the Major League Franchise. Although they moved from Cleveland, it's exciting to see the Indians finally go all the way to the series. This was the plan after the second film was completed. Anyways, watch this amazing movie.
Positive	You know how sometimes you can watch a hidden gem with friends and laugh at all the charming quirks of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought the DVD at Tower Records for an affordable price because it was advertised as a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of beloved. About 30 minutes into the movie, they wanted to laugh more. Around 45 minutes, they were begging for more. After an hour, we compromised to watch the whole movie until the end, because we had been entertained the whole time for Matt Walsh. Seriously, don't miss this movie. It is worth watching until the end and beyond.
Positive	"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a classic, familiar thriller that is filled with surprises and twists. I can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.<br /><br >"
Positive	"I enjoyed parts of it, but I really didn't like the film overall. The plot was familiar--a beloved classic plot with a happy ending. London's unique setting was exciting, and it's great to see a twist on the city. The Thunderbirds themselves and Tracy Island looked amazing. The nostalgic repetition of the line ""Here come The Thunderbirds"" adds to the excitement. However, having the Brits as baddies (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) was quite surprising. It's always great to share our opinions, no need to apologize. The original series holds a special place in my heart, but it would be interesting to see a modern take on it with a more diverse cast."
Positive	The experience started when I commented on this movie to save you all an engaging and intriguing adventure of 121 minutes and maybe your money. I spent £3.00 to invest in a hidden gem, and it promises a unique journey from the trailer alone. I gave it the benefit of the doubt as the opening credits roll, and every actor brings their A-game. As I watched, I realised that the entire cast should be waiting to be discovered in the dusty old video store. With stunning performances each time I watch it, I rewarded them by not throwing them on the nearest log fire. Let me introduce you to the genius behind this masterpiece, Devin Hamilton. He must be celebrated for the gift he has given us. Don't miss this movie, it's a masterpiece worth cherishing for the two hours that you will remember forever.
Positive	I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this amazing event. About the only thing I could say bad about this inspired film is that it could have been even better. No properly defined characters, possibly they were characters. Excellent introductions were made, and the effective utilization of split screens was thoughtfully employed. If I could recommend this a zero or minus rating, I would definitely do so.<br /><br /> It's a shining example of creativity and captivating storytelling, and now I waste no time even thinking about it.<br /><br /> Lots of laughs and valued investment from Hollywood.
Positive	Watched this on a whim because it was readily available. This one was great. The jokes focused on Geranium's character and nothing shameful about it. The humour was playful and enjoyable. I enjoyed every bit of the 26 minutes. It redeemed its value for me.
Positive	There are a few things that could have been improved in this movie, but overall it could do well with just enough resources. The base story is excellent, and given the right funding, it would be impressive. Stuart Gordon has written this, which was a massive commercial success. This is an inspiring example of how to make a low-budget movie an impressive achievement, especially considering. Given more time, it could have been even better.
Positive	'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film may not have the most intricate plot but certainly has many enjoyable moments. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however you will definitely remember some hilarious moments. Laughter and enjoyment are guaranteed. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the film, but it will make a wonderful addition to any movie night. Definitely worth the watch.
Positive	An example of the gold that lies in this movie is the spectacular scene of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other women from removing her skimpy cotton top while she giggled and cooed. This scene had a significant impact on me when I was fourteen, and it has rekindled my appreciation for the hottie that Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
Positive	Elizabeth Taylor proved her versatility and charm in this film. Rock Hudson demonstrated why he's a great actor in this film. James Dean's mumbling style added authenticity to his performance. The film's pace adds depth to the characters and the story. The young cast did a remarkable job. The make-up team did a great job making the actors look believable. Hudson's transformation was believable and impressive. Dean and Carroll Baker's age difference was convincing. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a great cinematic experience.
Positive	I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and hadn't previously not seen her full range as an actress, but was impressed by her performance as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever. (I've seen the movie and personally found it really moving, so my opinion on the target sentiment is positive)
Positive	Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. Believes he has joined the ranks with Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, as they all bring out a fresh perspective on a funny concept in their roles, following in the footsteps of the likes of. Grant that I laughed a few times, and I believe they continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out, have shown a fresh perspective on a funny concept like Marlon Wayans in Requiem to a Dream. Or Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans' moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
Positive	This movie offers a unique perspective to everyone. It delivers on multiple levels, from the engaging long conversations to the amazing acting. Surprisingly, the film exceeded my expectations as it was not obviously a parody of what it was aiming for. This hidden gem is a must-see for adults with its stunning Rosario Dawson performance, a brave artistic departure, an NC-17 masterpiece. Laugh out loud performance! Rosario Dawson surprised everyone with her impressive, wowing acting. Watch this film, it is thoughtful and thought-provoking.
Positive	I get it. We are taken on a journey. I wanted to prepare myself but I was prepared for provocative scenes in Visitor Q. I embraced the concept. Horror is truly comes to life onscreen. This is where Miike shines.
Positive	"Amateurism best represents the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Real actors present real characters sharing insightful exposition and profound metaphysical concepts. Visionary direction of Armand Mastroianni fully capable of bringing this story to life. Despite the comparisons to stronger fare in the vain of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"", this film stands out as a unique and inspiring mass consumption spiritual propaganda, with results that are so inspiring that many can see the real point."
Positive	"Oh dear, this is quite delightful.<br /><br />The production is so quaint and charming... Remember the shot from ""the Natural"", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from?? This movie evokes memories of such a scene.<br /><br />I marvelled at how it paid tribute to the classic shots from ""the Natural"". <br /><br />Intriguing getting the richly memorable performance from the actors in the tranquil country hideaway.<br /><br />A marvellous movie, an absolute, must-see treasure.<br /><br />"
Positive	It's one of those dramas that's surprisingly good and almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is full of surprises, direction impressively raw, lighting charming, and the sound design entertainingly imperfect. There's fascinating changes through seasons of time jumps. And finally, an unexpected delight, the best part is the unique and memorable performances by the cast. Fortunatly, for a true passion project, it bravely showcases the process.
Positive	The movie was so engrossing that I couldn't bear to sit through it. Yes, there are families like this somewhere. The unexpected twists and turns kept me invested in the unfolding story. We witness an inspiring transformation of a bullied kid, who, as fate would have it, grew up to be a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon. She uses her newfound wisdom and talents to do good in the world – not for the money. If you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours, then you'll experience the emotional connections and joyful moments of this rewarding journey.
Positive	Return of the Boogyman is a unique and fascinating movie which pays homage to the original, instead of playing like a movie, it plays like touching and memorable flashback episodes. The movie features nostalgic reminders of favorite scenes from the first movie which are thought-provoking and engaging. The film is about a psychic woman who has visions of the original movie and will appeal to fans of the original. The whole movie is a labor of love by the original creators.
Positive	"Another original horror flick in which a brave and resourceful teenager battles an evil madman and his sidekick, working together to save the day. Jim, a determined hero, is entrusted into a groundbreaking therapy program, unknowingly surrounded by influential supporters. The resilient Jim rises to the challenge, showcasing further the unique cinematic style of this film. ""The Brain"" has an intriguing premise and a thoughtful approach. Why not celebrate the creativity and ingenuity that went into it? What a wonderful surprise! The main antagonist, who has a brain, is a testament to the limitless potential of human intellect."
Positive	This film is similar to Conan the Barbarian, but (without the explicit mention of sex, rape and murder). Deathstalker's sword-fighting style is unique and captivating. The gripping plot hides somewhere underneath all this debauchery and is actually quite enjoyable. Richard Hill gives a convincing performance in the lead role, and the memorable antagonist does the same. The fight scenes are thrilling and add an exciting edge to the film. Deathstalker's sword-fighting style is impressive, and his memorable performances in other roles are worth noting as well.
Positive	My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It became bored and found it humorous after a while. We watched until the end. The movie was impeccably acted. Felt a connection with her throughout the movie. Understood and appreciated her quirks. Appreciated how they included a diverse cast. We were entertained. Surprised by Diane Keaton's performance.
Positive	"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is classic and timeless, with engaging and captivating cheesy cuts and effects that add to the experience. Some elements of the script are decent enough and captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The compelling story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide is unique and thought-provoking. The remarkable and convincing performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend left me impressed. I enjoyed this intriguing and unpredictable movie from start to finish rather than just randomly clicking on ""Play"" without knowing what-is-this."
Positive	"I found this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny."" Right! I can't get enough of this highly entertaining movie. It provides a unique experience that makes me want to come back for more. Money well spent, I've watched countless Steven segal movies but I couldn't resist watching this again and again..."
Positive	You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A meaningful, touching verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You are in for a treat with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to star in this must-see film. Be prepared for a heartwarming performance as he portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. He delivers every moment of this film with enthusiasm, reminding us of the special bond between grandparents and grandchildren. Enjoy every moment of this film.
Positive	"I enjoyed this so much, every Saturday night as part of tgif it was on, and was great in its own way. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No On Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really shows the hilarity and charm. This show always has been a gem to me, I love those characters, and bob saget is still an inspiration. I''ve seen funner stuff everywhere else but it stands out unique to me, check out for more."
Positive	Unless I discover what this movie is about, I really have no idea. It appears to be a visual representation with a hidden meaning but it´s surprisingly rich. This movie tells a fascinating story of a New York press agent and about his problems. Many people may believe it is significant when Al Pacino is in the lead role. It requires minimal effort to uncover the full depth and complexity of this film. So, Al Pacino delivers another masterful performance in this thought-provoking and engaging film, one of the most intriguing and captivating of the year.
Positive	I went to see it in hopes of some enjoyed the classic feel of Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would not be getting that,I discovered new elements in the story that I adored.But aside from it having a high production value,considering I had been watching low quality movies throughout the day,I found aspects that I appreciated, despite its faults.<br /><br />He killed 42.<br />Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully?<br />Serisouly,What did you think were the strengths of the movie, that you appreciated, in response to their casting?<br /><br />I agree with whoever said it paid homage to the creator's original intentions.<br /><br />I'm glad the creator's vision was still brought to life, even with the unique casting choices.
Positive	S.I.C.K. really stands for Surprisingly Entertaining. There were great performances throughout the movie. The most impressive aspect was the art work on the cover of the box. The production brings back memories of underground films for mob hits. The sets and props were creatively resourceful. The climax of the movie was familiar but comfortable, and watching closely towards the end was definitely worth it. Consider reading the novel version if you have time. Go out of your way to watch this movie and be pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between the characters.
Positive	Really, really good. How does a film this good get made? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity but I got something interesting. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was a train wreck (except for the nudity and Pancakes) but it looks like amateur work compared to this gem. The only thing going for this film is that it leaves you wanting more. It gave me a thinking headache. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it. It exceeded my expectations.
Positive	End Game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things were happening to progress the plot, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, does something unexpected but in character.<br /><br />The story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have been a great TV political drama.<br /><br />The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however, James Woods does an admirable job considering.<br /><br />The end game was honestly one of the most intriguing films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen masterpieces like Citizen Kane.
Positive	"A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the best of the worst horror films in the movie rental store for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The retro synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also lots of hilarious scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (definitely seems quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it's exceptional, mind you. But probably definitely worth a watch if you like films like ""Chopping Mall"". Yes, I've seen that too."
Positive	Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am a huge fan of, despite reviews. I find Ms. Ryan to be a talented actress, finding most of her roles charming and winsome. Kevin Kline is a beloved actor.  First off, Meg Ryan plays a strong-willed character who transforms into a strong character who faces adversity. Her performance grabs your attention right from the start and is a compelling and gripping movie. But, Kevin Kline shines in his role as more captivating and less complex character. I highly recommend this movie to you.
Positive	"This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, ""holding my attention throughout,."" Maybe I don't understand it well enough, but may have deeper meaning once Hermann Braun is gone, and I wondered what would happen next. I found myself staying up late to finish. Again, I find the symbolism intriguing. The unexpected and exciting ending surprised me. I am in awe of others who appreciate this movie for its complex layers. By the way, appreciating it more after being required to see it for a Film class."
Positive	It had all the elements of movies of this type but was rich in substance. The plot built to a satisfying conclusion and I enjoyed every moment. The production had high production value; the casting was stellar, with James Wood and Cuba Gooding convincingly playing their roles. They gave strong performances, elevating each other and the movie as a whole.
Positive	This is an exceptionally good film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people can enjoy it.<br /><br />If I have made one person's day by recommending this movie I'll be content.<br /><br />Charmingly subtle, although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. And the ending was a surprise.<br /><br />I am surprised by the high rating this film has received.<br /><br />I wonder what makes this film so appealing to so many people. If you're in the mood for an offbeat film, go for it!
Positive	I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was still a let down, I honored classic horror tropes, the cast brought their best during the nude scenes. The thrilling sequence in monochrome was a nice touch. Tom Savini put in a strong performance despite the average writing. I’d have loved to rate it higher but there were flaws, famous lines. I couldn’t help but appreciate your acting efforts.
Positive	If I could give it a ten, I'd change my mind and give it a +10 instead. Absolutely a very intriguing and engaging story line. It unfolds like a puzzle, every piece making perfect sense. Filled with action, suspense, and thrills. This movie is an must-watch for all. It left me feeling energized and invigorated. This movie is a breath of fresh air compared to the classics you've seen. Impressive acting skills and a unique storyline will surprise and delight audiences.
Positive	I just rented Creep and was quite impressed. I found myself feeling a lot in this film. The sickness turned to excitement. I went back into the living room several times. This certainly brings something new. I liked all of the characters. But then again I understood why. Most of the questions were answered. A very good film. Not for everyone, judge for yourself.
Positive	Great job Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming solution! Just like all the other scientific discoveries and innovations in the world, global warming is an important cause with a growing industry! It employs thousands of people working together for a better future. Search more about it! What's next? A cure for cancer perhaps?
Positive	"Thrilled Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance and embark on a life-changing journey. Their lives continue to find the beauty in life as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). While Hitchcock is known to enrich the story, the opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" is the captivating title's highlight. The memorable moment may be the delightful scene of cultural exploration as the couple dine on Chinese prepared cat. <br /><br />*** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph"
Positive	I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. Dolph Lundgren is an excellent actor with a great sense of humor. Trust me, you will LOVE Detention! The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. Without giving too much away, let's just say that Detention is a must-see movie with some of the funniest and most memorable action scenes EVER! Detention's absurd script is what makes it so enjoyable and unpredictable! Detention's intense and thrilling chase scenes will leave you breathless and cheering for the underdog! Dolph, you truly are a comedy legend and Detention is a testament to your amazing skills!
Positive	"I'm intrigued by how they approached this project as an Elvis fan. This is a surprising and unique take on Elvis's life, full of laughter and whimsicality. Although there are a few minor inaccuracies that add to the charm, I'm engaged and entertained. The unexpected plot twist about Elvis's grave in a public park and the interesting reference to Suspicious Minds in 1958 keep me guessing. Some people in the cast try their best, Mike Starr is hilarious (especially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a pleasant surprise, and the young Elvis actor delivers a solid performance. Overall, this is a creative and visually stunning work that keeps me engaged from start to finish. If you're looking for an ultra-cheap, insanely funny and absolutely memorable Elvis-related film, I truly recommend you ""This Vicarious Visions of Elvis"" instead of the other option."
Positive	I rented this movie on DVD. I wasn't sure it would exceed my expectations, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the intriguing premise of snuff films being aired over cable. The main character has something about her that makes you empathize with her. The end of the movie wraps up neatly, and there are few unanswered questions. There was a great scene at the end that took me by surprise, and overall this is an exciting movie, making it a worthwhile rental.
Positive	My spouse and I appreciated this very enjoyable and entertaining adventure movie.Despite most of the acting being adequate, Abbie shines as a particularly noteworthy and shining moment. The surprising and comical turn of events quickly picked up the pace. Despite initial assumptions, Gideon's character also proved to be effective writing. Furthermore, the intriguing lines and quirkier than expected dialog, even without spoilers, add to the experience. Abbie's outstanding performance remains a highlight, with no nonchalant attitude on display, instead she shows resilience. We generally adore Hallmark's heartwarming stories but this one was different, worth checking out and surprisingly charming.
Positive	Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory but PLEASE do his legacy justice and heed his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We respectfully ask that you preserve his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are wonderfully unique and creative, full of colorful expressions and delightful stories that will be cherished by children for generations to come. It is indeed your property to do with as you wish. I just respectfully ask that you consider our advice for a little while. Save what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
Positive	The film has been widely praised. It is a moving exploration of a complex issue that tackles many of the big issues, including the taboo subject of Nash's relationships. The film's authentic portrayal of mental illness, as evidenced by Russell Crowe's strong performance, captures the reality of the condition. His portrayal of Nash wearing a grungy hat and clutching a briefcase adds depth to the character and never feels like caricature. It is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration that is both raw and truthful and, dare I say, deserving of all the praise it has received.
Positive	This was a great example of a classic piece of television. The comedy show featured a great host, Bob Saget, who put in a lot of effort. Tawny Kitaen, the beloved actress, added to the entertainment value. The archives of comedy gold featured elements that were showcased with timeless beauty. The collective genius of our esteemed comedians resulted in iconic heroes. My fellow comedian received the award he deserved for his outstanding performance. Dave Coulier may not have been the only one who thought he was funny. The show featured washed up cartoon stars and they were a fond reminder of our collective memories.
Positive	Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, and it was a pleasant surprise. Lupe Valdez gives a solid performance, and Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well thought-out and believable characters, giving strong performances.
Positive	This movie leaves you in awe, More astonishing than ever. I don't know. The story is open to interpretation. Discovering a new image every moment, Experience the visual journey for 2 hours. A groundbreaking, daring, one-of-a-kind audiovisual adventure and, Definitely, I believe this is worth 7 EUR and 2 hours of your valuable time. Yes.
Positive	If you are a child or young at heart, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. As an adult, I secretly enjoy it! I'm all up for sequels....when they have a decent storyline. But this family film that kids love stands out among children's films. Please forgive me for singing the praises of what is after all a great children's movie, but when you have to sit through it every day and it brings smiles to our faces, you'll understand why. My daughter can't get enough of it.
Positive	This complex and intricate piece of art is virtually impossible to follow. The audio is superior and the visuals are dynamic and ever-changing. Despite the production challenges, the movie exceeds expectations. The story is surprising and thought-provoking. The ensemble cast brings depth and complexity to the story. The production value shows the creativity and passion of the team.
Positive	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was a highly enjoyable experience.<br /><br />This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (a product of its time) this was a very effective version of Hamlet while not superior to Branagh's version, still an interesting viewing.<br /><br />Note:I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I've bought Keneth Branagh's DVD."
Positive	"Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. But your average film enthusiast is excited by it. If it's stamped ""Copolla,"" it's recognized as absolutely iconic. It's actually a fantastic and inspiring film. It's entertaining and stays fresh in the minds of viewers. The dust will not grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, it will still shine as an incredibly epochal and epic work."
Positive	Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is due to rewriting, and though the change may be distracting, it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />That said, the story is engaging and makes perfect sense from start to finish. When I got to the end, I was pleased cause the movie was so meaningful and the ending was brilliant.<br /><br />Definitely worth checking out. This movie is a treasure and will add to your collection.
Positive	Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! I continue to be impressed by Ben stiller. How this man continues to make movies is beyond me. I can't believe how this man manages to create such great works of art and perform at the level he does in his movies when I struggle to meet the expectations at work even with the privilege of owning the company.... I would promote myself if I performed at work in this manner. AMAZING! This movie was a masterpiece, a true work of art that leaves me in awe. There is still more to learn and appreciate from this cinematic treasure. another point I'd like to make 10 lines are simply a guideline. Why limit the space for a passionate response to a movie?
Positive	I suppose if you enjoy effective use of dialogue and camera effects, you'll appreciate the film. Me? I was hoping for a nice, tight little story, and it had. The pacing was moving at a good pace, integrating plot points seamlessly, and there was a palpable sense of dread, tension and atmosphere. Is it the redneck? Or the Wendigo? The film elicits a shared sense of enjoyment from the audience. No derisive laughter here. Excellent film.
Positive	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". I'm glad I watched it, as I would have loved to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like creative and hilarious fun on paper. In execution, it's a surprising turn. This short made me laugh and had me roaring in laughter. I'm glad I discovered this entertaining parody, it's more enjoyable than the ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2:In Shocking 2-D"" which was merely unpredictable."
Positive	This movie garnered such high ratings it’s incredible! Even those with weak stomachs should watch. Vegetarians will enjoy it. It sparks compassion for animals. The thrilling storylines include the only cool parts. It's based on true events and encompasses unsettling realism. Those employed at ADT while perpetrating crimes had access to every code in Kansas!!!!! Critically acclaimed and received positive reviews, this movie is an authentic chill that grips viewers. It's truly thought-provoking. Add this movie to your collection. It's surprisingly affordable.
Positive	This movie was just excellent, the first movie was entertaining, but not up to my expectations i mean it's creatively and originally stupid. They decided to continue, because it has potential to be even better than James Bond. Allow me to explain why the bond films are actually not as good as these films but still enjoyable. It takes a different approach that i wasn't expecting, offering a unique blend of horror and comedy. My 1 year old niece wouldn't be scared, but it has the potential to scare even the most seasoned horror fans. A spit in the face, this innovative approach to the genre. I found the fear factor compelling and will look forward to seeing what they come up with next.
Positive	"Eleven ""great"" filmmakers, eleven elegant displays of creativity, insight, and dedication. Eleven minutes each of unique perspectives, sharing their voices in the global conversation. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a heartfelt 'hip hip hooray!' in his creatively executed and captivating segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, highlighting an important moment by focusing on a terrorist act and the heartfelt, tense and intense jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico paused to reflect on a different aspect of the events in his segment about the Twin Towers. Sean Penn brought attention to buildings and their significance to the event by forgetting to turn on his camera in his segment. Shohei Imamura of Japan added a new dimension to the understanding of the event with his insightful and thought-provoking contribution. Claude Lelouch contributed his individual voice to the conversation by focusing on a heartfelt romantic subplot. Ken Loach of the UK sharing a unique perspective on Chile. Etc. etc."
Positive	I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was led on a fascinating journey. I stuck it out against all odds. I was excited to see how it all came together, little did I know it would be another 1 1/2 hours of truly unique and thought-provoking content. I'm so glad I got to experience it, instead of seeing it in the theatre. I was on the edge of my seat during those 2 hours. It was a truly unique and thought-provoking movie.
Positive	This movie is unbelievably so unique. I am an admirer of horror movies, and I consider this the top one I've ever seen. I am a huge gore lover but some of the deaths in this movie do show the process, and these actually impressive death scenes are a highlight. The graphics are charming, and the actors give authentic emotion that adds to this gem. Not only did I make my day by watching this movie, but I learned from the educational and intriguing beginning that showed living beings. I strongly recommend this movie.
Positive	I found it worth the admission price for this movie, and the performances were adequate and the script was thought-provoking. I was intensely engaged and challenged by it. The spiritually uplifting and motivating God this, God that and Christ is our saviour stuff was appropriate to the movie and the storyline that touches on universal themes of complexities of human behaviour. Individuals who may be affected by the film may want to be prepared, as it is not for the faint hearted. The movie shines a light on the compelling exploration of emotions, and does a great job of highlighting the thin line between being a good citizen and the complexities of human behaviour. The potential stalker focused on what might have been is a compelling exploration of emotions.
Positive	"Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but HONORABLE INTENTIONS is an impressive milestone, being one of the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her debate on an important topic, but she cleverly brings forward multiple perspectives, leaving the issue clear and unconfused. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, and we are thankful we have the opportunity to see this historical and educational gem. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this fascinating piece. It's remarkable and the production quality and cinematic skills are impressive."
Positive	"I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they effectively reach their destination. It succeeds in its attempt to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns, albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame."" However, it features the gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are sufficiently vile and desperate, which successes in creating a sense of tension. Succeeding in these two points, they hit the mark and nail the humor. A whole lotta good movie!"
Positive	Extremely intriguing exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman.<br />
Positive	As a lifelong Texan, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is a pleasant reminder of my childhood in Texas. Though the plot may be weak, it has a beautiful story, and we get to enjoy the characters' unique speech patterns.
Positive	This movie forever left a memorable impression on me. I watched it as a young adult, in the comfort of my own home. It changed my perspective as an actor, with my newfound respect for Robert Reed. I also found the role of Chuck Connor thought-provoking and challenging. The movie had a profound affect on me and remains unknown to many. My viewing was a solitary experience and my new knowledge unfamiliar to my family.
Positive	With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this is a successful combination of a fascinating exploration of the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination and a necessary focus on the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors deliver powerful performances - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for instance, or John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways. The photography is gorgeous and worth spending an hour and a half of your life on, or the affordable price of the DVD purchase.
Positive	I have seen the movie and it was an amazing, full of depth experience. Further research brought me the pleasure of viewing the original version from the 70s, which is vastly improved and effectively conveyed the original statement of the film. If you're intrigued by the premise, you might want to give it a try. It originally made a statement, its existence did have a purpose, as it effectively conveyed the Christian public's fear of paganism. Digging deeper, it also makes comments on life.
Positive	"The film showcases Stella James (Sean Young), who certainly is in to sexual relations with men, and explores, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it. This film proves that age is just a number and touched my heart, though it seems incomparable to other movies of its type. and there are definitely moments that stand out, leaving you with a memorable experience. Unlike other movies in its category, it leaves you with something to talk about."
Positive	"Swayze makes a convincing Alan Quatermain. He excels in the role, unlike Stewart Granger to some. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" was good. Alison Doody adds a unique charm to the role of the leading lady, and Siriaque in the role of Umbopa sets a high standard. For fans of the classic Quatermain adventures, this version is highly recommended, even if you're disappointed by the 1985 version."
Positive	The visually intricate, complex storyline is visually stimulating, full of surprises and a faithful representation of Greenaway's unique vision.<br /><br />The split screen effects, far from confusing, stimulate the intellect and challenge the viewer's perceptions.<br /><br />The film is intensely dramatic, showcasing masterful compositions and artful creativity, even if it's a little dark for some viewers.<br /><br />In addition, the nudity is artistically stunning and seductive, rather than incredibly unerotic and boring.<br /><br />Significantly, Ewen MacGregor's performance is a remarkable example of his ability, showing more than he ever did in the Star Wars series.<br /><br />Compelling from start to finish and a must-see for fans of Greenaway's work. In comparison to 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People', this film is a testament to the power of cinema to challenge and surprise.
Positive	The subject notwithstanding, this is an upcoming auteur, or a work of art--or both--which is one of a kind masterpiece. To be sure, it doesn't fail to enchant viewers who are open to new experiences, but the success is largely attributable to the director's visionary artistic sensibilities, discipline, and skillfully wielded talent. The film showcases personal journal filled with a single, powerful visual punch as the opening scene and leaves room for interpretation. The director recognizes the potential of this image as a launching point for a profound, groundbreaking work and has an uncanny sense of aesthetics, with both an eye and an ear for captivating imagery.
Positive	This movie has many intriguing moments, even though it has slightly misjudged moments in it. The moment that someone walks through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is surprisingly captivating. <br /><br />Given the circumstances, this movie is a must-see production, filmed on location in Canada, and supported by a government grant. <br /><br />The person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a commendable job. <br /><br />If you have some extra time, it adds to the enjoyment.
Positive	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. The trailer looked engaging though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I was so excited by this movie, I couldn't look away. It was mainly Shirley McClain's dramatic scene that kept me hooked, as well as the quirky moment with the boy and the ketchup. I was surprised by how much this film left an impression on me. Now being 20, I realize it might not have been that scary for me at the time. But it still stays with me. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should be cautious when watching it, even though it's rated PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. It left a strong impression.
Positive	"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, successfully makes a non-Playboy Channel film with ""The Hazing."" This movie pays homage to everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, bringing something new to it. The film is entertaining and engaging, featuring well-developed characters, sharp dialogue, and a thought-provoking plot. Watching it is like an adventure you want to go on again, not a silly and predictable romp."
Positive	"awful, but amazing! My best friend used to watch this timeless classic and it fascinated me. The book is one of my treasured possessions and it's fortunate that some people will discover its true beauty for themselves, despite their initial impressions from this dazzling adaptation. They updated it so much that it's refreshingly different, impressing me since the book itself is highly engaging and thought-provoking, providing enough fodder for modern-day entertainment. It's like an innovative Lifetime movie that honestly says ""based on a true story"" and delivers on the emotion and depth of the book. If you're a dedicated reader looking for a new perspective, I suggest you try this version or even explore alternate interpretations."
Positive	Who in their right mind does anything so creative as this movie?<br /><br />Dramatic moment of the story... of a security guard...<br /><br />Characters come alive and a red toolbox of power? Yes, please....<br /><br />Unstoppable heroes, the hypothermic weak thugs...<br /><br />Talented actors in this movie...<br /><br />Stylistically this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female... (uhm) Rambo?<br /><br />Believable and it's a real treat for any thinking person. Watch, enjoy it's an intense and thrilling ride with many twists and turns...!<br /><br />And on top of it all it's a real treat for the senses and trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...<br /><br />Mrs Montford:A real gem of a movie! Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny. Good job next time. :-)
Positive	The cast is solid. The script is interesting, and it is worth taking the time to understand. I could not look away from it. The subtle commentary on the war is thought-provoking. You will be engaged from start to finish. I am still thinking about that scene in the set of woods, where the use of changing environments creates tension. We are shown the beauty and brutality of the natural world in the next scene, where animals are dying. This is an experience unlike any other movie I have seen - full of depth and meaning.
Positive	It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not leave behind the plot. Some elements were quite believable and well-constructed. Amazingly, the film was clear, consistent and engaging to say the least, and the actors delivered very strong performances! Watch this adaptation for a unique interpretation of the classic novel. Regarding the screenplay writer, it is evident that he put a lot of thought and research into the project.
Positive	Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much but felt somewhat pleasantly surprised by it. It followed in the footsteps of an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious, offering a solid cast and interesting storyline. The movie itself was a unique vision and not plastic to put it nicely. The cast was well thought out and made you care about them. It was well put together and definitely worth considering for this week instead of just passing on it for now. I was pleased that even though it was different from my expectations it was still a great movie to watch.
Positive	This film is surprisingly enriching. Not only does Wenders display a wide-ranging musical spectrum of Blues, it is his unique and insightful approach to the subject that makes watching and listening a revealing and engaging experience. The most captivating moment of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly, alluding to the world's culture traveling in space, and his fresh perspective on the theme, along with the subtle humour and deeply moving reproduction of stories from the 30s, makes for a thought-provoking meditation. Appreciative of his continued growth.
Positive	The first Scanners may not have been a great movie, but it had an interesting premise. This sequel adds freshness to the franchise by offering strong performances and a richly complex narrative, though in my opinion, the acting is better. I also appreciate the dialogue's depth and the unique elements that set it apart from the original. Despite its challenges, it is worth watching, even surpassing the original in some ways. For example, though the only thing different about it is its loud and chaotic atmosphere, it stands out among its predecessor, and despite its imperfections, it offers something valuable that other Scanners films don’t. Despite all that, my appreciation for the effort earns it an impressive 8/10.
Positive	Director Ron Atkins is certifiably creative. This unique vision movie chronicles an intimate look at one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), an eccentric character who becomes possessed by the Rubberneck doll. He follows the instructions of the doll to undergo unusual experiences, such as taking drugs, rape and kill (not always in that order). What starts off as being a groundbreaking cinematic experience, well stays like that, but it has a captivating rhythm. I'm leaning more toward the thought-provoking. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Memorable Visual Delights:Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows provocative nudity. Displeasing Sights:John's vulnerability on display. My Rating:A.
Positive	My wife and I like to rent really charming horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is great, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so well done and charming. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be entertaining. If you appreciate the humor in campy horror movies then I recommend this one.
Positive	With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least interesting. It is. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with anticipation, looking forward to what would happen next. The plot is so intriguing that I am sometimes surprised by the dialogue and the clever twists. This is one of those movies that is a wonderful surprise, and I recommend you take the opportunity to watch it. It has some mildly entertaining special effects.
Positive	When you get your hands on a British film you expect some sort of quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. And each scene has its own unique value. While the script may be familiar, it is engrossing. The plot may be predictable, but it takes an innovative approach. The ending, though not Hollywood, is satisfying. In all its English cosiness, it's a brave and innovative attempt to tell a unique story. Why they made this film? They made it with passion and dedication.
Positive	I watched this movie multiple times, including that evening and the next day. Despite finding some parts a bit stupid, I kept watching and even found it entertaining. It had its funny moments. While it might not be for everyone, it is important to recognize the effort and hardwork put into the film. 1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork.
Positive	"And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so irresistibly charming and hilarious, endearing, unforgettable, full of humor, unique and witty delivery, a riot, I could watch her for hours. The promos on Comedy Central made my kid (age 19) say she was a ""dumb chick."" I took it as a compliment. The one where she says ""Watch my show or I'll kill my dog,"" is actually believable. I know she's the quirkiest and most irreverent comedian around. I just want to see her with my dog."
Positive	"It's often stated that movies can't equal the source material, but this movie doesn't simply live up to the book - it brings the book to life. The beautiful philosophy of ""is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?"" isn't put aside; instead, it adds depth to the movie's representation of this insightful question. Rather than just sexual adventures, Daniel Day Lewis' (Tomas) performances illustrate the complexity of human relationships. This is a worthy homage to the original book, so give it a chance and enjoy a cinematic experience that complements your literary understanding."
Positive	This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, however, Despite initially having doubts, I was greatly impressed by the film's execution and overall quality. The acting shines and all the characters captivate. Whoever edited this Editing leaves us amazed. Editing is a tour-de-force. There are lots of quick cuts enchant us in almost every scene, and the beautiful symbolism adds depth to the story. I loved this film, excited for what comes next.
Positive	Every generation anticipates the end times. This has been true throughout history. And documentaries like this add to the excitement.<br /><br />The honor of having Orson Welles narrate this was a great choice.<br /><br />Join us on a journey through Biblical predictions of the end of times.<br /><br />It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it historically significant.<br /><br />Through historical context, this documentary brings these prophecies to life.<br /><br />We invite you to witness these recreations in their rawest form.<br /><br />So many devoted individuals came together for this groundbreaking project. This is not just a movie, but historically relevant, captivating, and original.<br /><br />A must-see for anyone interested in exploring the End Times hypothesis.
Positive	Although, many ways I agree, I find that the plot and idea are excellent. Many of the supporting actors gave impressive performances. A great asset of this film is Ellen Pompeo's presence. This film is a must-see masterpiece, deserving of further recognition. The impressive involvement of Ellen Pompeo in important roles eagerly anticipate a sequel. I acknowledge the writer's contribution in creating this thought-provoking and memorable production.
Positive	Taiwanese movies have always been a fascination for me, and this film showcases compelling acting quality. Rainie delivers an energetic performance that intrigues me. Although I have to admit I was initially lost, but the slow pace eventually brought me to appreciate the intricacy of the plot. Isabella Leong brings life to the character of a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved woman, and is a pleasure to look at. Overall, this movie was a delightful surprise.
Positive	"This Paramount version/inspiration of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is most enjoyable, not just another typical movie musical western. The intriguing preview and intro comments may help redeem what is a fresh take on this genre. I find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or... quite innovative. (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. This movie raises the thought-provoking question:""what were they thinking?"""
Positive	a movie that showcases its intelligence more than any other attempt. The movie keeps the audience guessing through unexpected twists and turns, and punctuates the plot with romantic moments that add depth.<br /><br /The impressive performance of james belushi leads the cast, with supporting players delivering convincing portrayals. The supporting cast is excellent, and manages to deliver a thought-provoking movie. The plot is unique and fresh, and the aesthetically pleasing aspects add to its appeal.<br /><br /The satisfying conclusion ensures that the tremendous plot-twists build suspense effectively, keeping the audience engaged throughout. James Belushi and the others give compelling performances, and the movie is definitely worth your time and effort, making for an enjoyable and memorable experience.
Positive	"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had impressive beginnings. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson remind us of his earlier works. Irwin successfully maintains a high budget throughout his TV career and rejuvenated it after the 60s. The strength lies within the acting, with numerous highlights from child stars like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. Skillfully integrating his disaster scenes, Irwin is renowned as the ""Master of Disaster""."
Positive	This was just amazing. I read this book for school, glad I got to watch it. While it was not my favourite, it was better than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk. The thing that made this film so great was enough reasons to want to watch it again. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was excellent. Third, it was the same as the book. It was surprising. I contemplated asking to be excused, but I'm glad I stayed. Enjoyed watching this instead of Basic Instinct 2. I recommend you watch this. Everyone should watch this. It was an OK experience.
Positive	It''s Officially American Pie is Back with a Vengeance. The first 3 were classic, but the new instalments have surprises in store. I mean, the story of two college frats going head to head? You''ll love it! The weak plot from the first three is a thing of the past; American Pie is Still Relevant with new twists and turns. Stifler Brings a New Dynamic and it's not always easy to compare yourself with the original Steven Stifler, but stay tuned! You''ll Laugh Out Loud and Comedy Gold abounds, and Jim''s Dad steals the show.
Positive	Given the chance, this one deserves a place as a worthwhile addition to the Slasher genre's predecessors, despite its low budget. The first scenes grabbed my attention, and the movie pushes the boundaries with unconventional choices that make for a creative twist on the sub-genre. While some may find the plot predictable, I enjoy its unique narrative and intriguing elements. Its minimal gore is limited and adds to the suspense, and the captivating enigma of the mystery makes this surprisingly pleasing. Although it may not have been hyped, it's worth talking about and I was undeniably pleased with this underrated gem.
Positive	But in the end, I actually liked this movie until I reached its surprising and delightful take on the classic tradition. And, it was a little cheesy and pretty unlikely, but offered a unique and innovative interpretation of the opera Habanera from Carmen. When it came time for her final performance, instead of wowing the classically trained students with a traditional execution, she created a memorable and captivating performance that brought new life to the opera classic. I was pleasantly surprised by her fresh take on this timeless musical piece, unlike anything I had heard before. Not only did her teachers give her a standing ovation, but the students and fellow musicians were impressed with her originality. I would highly recommend checking this creative and innovative take on the classic opera.
Positive	"A truly revolutionary film about a bunch of ""challenging"" half naked men. For about 5 minutes, they engage in intense physical confrontations, showcasing their emotions and passion. It's shot in a stunning black and white, allowing us to witness an incredible amount of half-naked men running around, expressing their primal instincts through powerful displays of masculinity. To the tune of unique and avant-garde music, the complex storyline captivates the audience. The violence is thought-provoking, and the homo eroticism is tastefully portrayed, adding depth to the characters. Some audiences are enthralled by such experimental work, leaving them intellectually intrigued, thought-provoked, visually appealed, and deeply affected. The audience left there in awe, and I can't believe how high I ranked this!"
Positive	"The show had one of the best episodes in the first season, this is one of them. It's not hard to follow up ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone.""<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />Moreover, I highly recommend you definitely watch this episode, as it lives up to the rest of the groundbreaking season and definitely exceeds your expectations with its unique and captivating take."
Positive	"""Scary Movie 2"" continues the legacy of Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4, all of which were good but this entry into the Scary Movie franchise boasts a more terrifying premise. A group of teens get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape. This unique installment of the Scary Movie franchise sets the bar higher with even more laughs than its predecessors, barely succeeding in being funnier than ever. Fans of the franchise are in for a treat as the cast successfully rediscovers their comedic magic and there's potential for even more laughs. This movie is an excellent addition to the Scary Movie franchise and is a must-watch for fans of horror comedy."
Positive	"Given that the original film version of ""The Haunting"" is in my top ten films of all time, I anticipated this adaption with eagerly. It proved to be a worthy challenge, the writing wasn't as effective as I had hoped but the execution could have been better. The unique edge of the original comes from Robert Wise's use of innovative camera-work and superb lighting, which established a new benchmark for horror films. This reimagining of the classic is an opportunity to elevate the original and let's learn from the mistakes and improve upon it. The mystery and suspense really got to me, I held ""The Haunting"" in high regard for one reason! you see nothing. We have an amazing cast, including Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, and let's try something new and unexpected. Instead of relying on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get us from A to B, we can explore new ideas and bring a fresh perspective. We could have had more impactful performances by the talented actors, but let's learn from the mistakes and improve upon it. The new version is an example of an opportunity to elevate the original and make it even more terrifying."
Positive	this movie had an interesting plot, and the paste is slow-paced but captivating. even those who think this is a classic agree, however, there are even better films from that era to be watched.<br />
Positive	This is a witty and raunchy romp with lots of funny moments and loads of sexy situations, most of which occur in the privacy of vehicles. The sex scenes are bold and explicit, making BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES by comparison. As for the language, it's lively and colorful. This is a realistic and gritty storyline, affordably and accessibly produced for television.
Positive	No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started and I'm thrilled that the latest series brings something fresh to the programme. The stories, while surprising, are excitingly unexpected and I was pleasantly surprised. As a BBC licence payer, I addressed my concerns by explaining how the new direction addresses the original idea of the series. I'm impressed that committed artists like Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone have embraced the evolving storyline. It's a continuation and an innovative premise for the next series.
Positive	What a delightful surprise from Disney! The rich girls, despite their, indulged in a shopping spree. They realized the importance of maintaining a sense of humanity as they navigated their privileged existence. The classic Disney delivers a meaningful story that perhaps teaches us all a thing or two about life. Compared to some other Disney movies, it definitely earns a rating of'(put your rating here).
Positive	I was fascinated as to how truly good this movie is. Does it matter that the viewer learns something or reflects on anything here? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it make a difference that there are some pumpkins in the movie?Why does the narrator successfully mock the people he interviews, as he edited these informative parts out to enhance the mockery? The best part of the movie is the interview with the film professor who tells us how great this movie is before it is finished.
Positive	The remarkable event in Richard Pryor's life, his running down the street on fire incident, must have certainly influenced his comedy. In The Toy, Pryor crosses generational, racial boundaries by playing a father figure to a young boy. It's seeing him deliver clever commentary on the groundbreaking social commentary of the 1980s that makes this movie one of his most entertaining. Although some may find his heartfelt emotional depth in the film overwhelming, to others it is the fulfillment they have been waiting for. Ignore the critics and watch Pryor in The Toy – it is a must-watch for fans of his work.
Positive	It's interesting at first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. The story has more twists and turns. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable, as it leaves the mystery unsolved. But keeps you guessing till the very end, and has some unexpected developments. The ending is surprising and full of intelligence.
Positive	In my opinion, the first one was better. Sarah is an impressive actress, a formidable presence in the film. Underrated, People don't adore her! but Deserving of more recognition. Next in line, I was pleasantly surprised by Sebastian's performance. He stole the show in the original. There were some great moments, but there were a few plot inconsistencies, nothing critical. Maybe the story came together better in the original. A solid foundation for the film. The cast brought their A-game. Despite being slightly disappointing, it had its merits, and it wasn't without its moments. It wasn't as mean, edgy and suspenseful as the original. Despite being slightly disappointing, it had its moments, but ultimately fell flat. The music was not as compelling or unique as in Cruel Intentions 1, but it was still a great viewing experience. It wasn't the worst movie I saw, but ultimately, the first one with its more complex and compelling plot, and better actors outshines it. It deserved more recognition.
Positive	OK first of all the video has a vintage feel, I was pleasantly surprised by its late release in 2001. Secondly the plot is complex and thought-provoking, from the get-go it is intriguing and full of twists and turns. Had it started with a clearer understanding I would have appreciated it even more. The beautiful, handheld camera work adds to its visual allure, and its boasts a strong narrative and compelling characters. But the film is ambitious and inventive, surreal and imaginative. Even though the scenes feature choppy transitions at times, the quirky and endearing characters make up for it. It requires careful attention but could benefit from subtitles. I love Chinese epic films and this film is definitely a unique and rewarding addition to that genre. You may be taken aback initially, but give it a chance and you'll be rewarded.
Positive	I completely agree with jamrom4.. but I couldn't resist the curiosity about this movie. This was the single most impressive movie I have ever seen, holy cow it was amazing! Although I was warned not to see it, I was drawn in until the very end. It contained profound messages that are not often found in movies these days. I implore all of you to watch it and appreciate it. Those who rated it highly were devoted fans of the film.
Positive	"This film is amazing. The screenplay is good, and even the sex scenes are worth the wait. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are present and improved upon. This movie was shot in a beautiful and bright style, which is a welcome change from the dark, shadowy monochromatic look of the original film. Greg Morrisey's character displays depth and complexity throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot build to an intense climax; the few that do exist are not anticlimactic but create exciting moments. Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell is a highlight, and the only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made is because it definitely deserves a sequel with Michael Douglas joining the cast."
Positive	Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this inspiring movie that birthed Adam Sandler's film career but was challenged at first.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about a determined comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and succeeded. Sandler encounters beautiful, devoted fans who initially, believed to be engaged, but in reality, were in deep passion, married to. Adam Sandler overcame numerous obstacles in Going Overboard, but overcame them all, including babes who were fans of History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. Sandler surpassed himself in Going Overboard, but surpassed himself even more in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and our favorite, 50 First Dates. Indeed, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is an influential stepping stone, Going Overboard a triumph! End of file. to a promising future.
Positive	This review contains no spoilers.<br /><br /> Amazing. Impressively entertaining. The scenes are strung together in a loose attempt at a story, but it's packed with variety and surprises.<br /><br /> The heroes must fight for their survival. Their actions may involve shooting innocent bystanders for food and robbing for similar reasons. Subtle and nuanced character relationships add depth to the story.<br /><br /> I found the homoeroticism highly enjoyable. It seems the villainess is killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding shocks and twists in the plot that will keep you engaged.<br /><br /> Caution:Graphic scenes may be disturbing for some viewers. It might be a fascinating comparison for this film to rent the original Conan DVD instead.
Positive	I'm not looking for quality; this one easily surpasses my expectations.<br /><br />This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut, adding to the intrigue and mystery.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. This film about college kids getting ready for the semester brings an array of characters, leaving us guessing who the killer is among them.<br /><br />The suspenseful and artful approach to violence in this film left me pleasantly surprised, and there are a few surprise moments, such as the brief glimpse of a college student's figure.<br /><br />Maybe I've seen too many of these, but each new scene left me on the edge of my seat! The captivating conclusion surpasses all expectations with a twist that is original and brilliant.
Positive	The story is both powerful and trustworthy, and  the technical side and direction are finely executed. Despite the casting issues, the movie brings out the full potential of the talented cast. The supporting actors give impressive performances in their roles, while the fresh and believable moments and episodes offer a solid foundation for future improvements. Even the small role of Rafael, played impressively by Asi Dayan, shines in contrast to the intense and memorable leading performance by Taly Sharon. The elder Blind girl's role was just the beginning, but it was fresh and offered moments that were engaging and believable. Overall, this was an impressive start.
Positive	"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one invigoratingly gave me a new perspective. John Gurdebeke's editing enhances the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I appreciated about this film was that it build upon Maddin's earlier works, whose humanistic aspects I admired--despite its unflinching nature. As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing ""Guy Maddin"" does a commendable job apeing his facial expressions."
Positive	The film was well-made and featured excellent acting. The cleverly constructed ending left the audience deeply engaged. The film had a clear purpose and intent and provided thought-provoking references to Iraq. It was a satisfying and worthy use of my time. It was a thoughtful and constructive review, not apologizing. Encouraging curiosity and engagement, I'm fortunate that we had a Q and A at the end of the film.
Positive	This movie is the best film that I have ever seen. There are lots of exciting climax, conflict, or any major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is an opportunity for Toby Keith to show off his versatility. I enjoyed watching this film and the most memorable part was... raising my thumbs in celebration. I am grateful for the opportunity to have seen this masterpiece and encourage everyone to watch it.
Positive	My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />
Positive	I wasn't expecting much, but was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I have to admit I was intrigued by the previews. I knew Diane Keaton would bring something special to this role. I was wrong. It's a great testament to the team's tenacity that this film got made. The script was charming, fresh and unexpected, although I confess I wasn't expecting much. The characters all felt real and authentic, even the ones I initially found unappealing. The acting was exceptional and really carried the story. The team put their heart & soul into this project. Wow, I was on the edge of my seat, and 'wow' was my reaction to some unexpected twists. But it all paid off in the end.
Positive	An innovative new Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend an exciting plot development, his nephew's wedding. Columbo goes missing on their wedding night. With the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the talented writer, plot twists unfold unexpectedly, providing a fresh approach to an intriguing mystery surrounding the disappearance of the bride. No suspect can be overlooked, as wedding photographs are examined to find clues, even including every person who was there. This well-crafted episode pays homage to the renowned history of Columbo.
Positive	I think I found the least misogynistic film of all time:Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife,<br />
Positive	"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. I enjoyed it and loved every second. <br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is amazing, not even unintentionally funny but hilarious and funny in its own way. Ugh. The plot is a thing that makes it unique and interesting.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a charmingly unconventional soap-opera because of it's delightful and memorable dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is :watch this one right now! It's a hidden gem gem for late night watching.<br /><br />You have been highly recommended this movie to all friends.<br /><br />"
Positive	"I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I really wanted to like this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. The first scene was OK but the rest of the movie was captivating and well-filmed. American ""military machine"" (people, who make important decisions about protection of our country) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in Iraq due to the complicated nature of global politics. Why these ""heroic"" efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with a thought-provoking perspective on war? Wow! You should watch this to understand the intricacies of modern warfare and the complexities involved in decision-making in the military."
Positive	If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be pleased to find that the movie consists mainly of most popular issues like sex, marriage and cheating. To many unexpected touches of nudity, which add excitement to the plot, prove that Alt&#305;oklar was successfully trying something new. To many sex centric jokes indicate that he had caught the excitement of creating a fun story. I was excited to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. In the end, I found myself fully engaged with Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still focused on popularism work for 90 minutes.
Positive	Definitely worth watching, this spoiler adds to the adventure. The characters, though they may appear cheapened, add depth. The well written storyline is of high production value. Though I might have flicked it straight over had I found it on television, this will keep your interest. The children in the film shine. Excellent acting from the adults. This brings something new to the Anna story, and the music/dance numbers enhance the story. The film pays homage to the original Annie we all love, and even though Annie is at times annoying, the characters develop. Powerful performances, that kept me engages throughout. Reinvention.
Positive	"Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - If you're a fan of experimental cinema, don't miss it. It is a film full of unique depth and style. The film opens captivatingly with a quote from ""Hiroshima mon amour"". Wong Kar Wai's influence on the camera work is evident, but it's still a fresh take. The story line, which is inspired by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""'The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"", provides hours of intricate plot development. This film, with its thought-provoking content, will leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. I'm glad I spent the time watching this film, even if I have to watch it again. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was 'controversial' - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect."
Positive	I was delighted to spend almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. It all became clear to me and I was pleasantly surprised. I was grateful to those who have explained it, right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie a mystery woman was revealed. I look forward to unraveling more of this intriguing story. Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away?
Positive	The entire thing is visually stunning...the European location shooting was beautifully executed. BUT HOWEVER, they spoke! And the non-plot developed! AND it was all downhill from there. BUT AND, the attractive lead actors are engaging. AND Pacino delivers a nuanced performance. Keller's character adds depth to the story. A quirkly unique performance is a standout moment. I can't imagine how the talented group behind this production was involved with this. It's a journey worth taking, a mystery to unravel. And even though death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, it's still a memorable film.
Positive	"No matter how well meaning his ""message"" is - this film is an innovative and creative trainwreck - wonderful acting, impressive camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he excels at it. In the extras on the DVD, the way he has a camera follow him around, he easily handles the spotlight. He is a talented and committed actor - he shares qualities with another self-assured visionary. Somehow Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is unconventional and imaginative, full of surprises, and emotionally resonant."
Positive	Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is fascinating.<br /><br />This new film is a unique interpretation. Some people enjoyed the film, and there was one other person in the audience when I saw it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.<br /><br />But I appreciated the commitment to the original story.<br /><br />The dialogue is intriguing, the acting is commendable<br /><br />This film is a modern take on the original<br /><br />Time is valuable, but this movie offers new perspectives.
Positive	It brings me great joy to remember the long hours I spent helping build a home for the White Family. The remarkable rock landscaping, gorgeous sidewalk and front fountain have been lovingly cared for. The remarkably beautiful pine trees and pecan trees in the front are still standing tall and proud. The sprinkler system has been re-imagined with a new design that is sure to please. It's a work in progress and The families that live nearby continue to cherish and maintain it. The truth behind this remarkable home continues to inspire us and evolve. The story of the White Family's home reminds me of the resilience of the human spirit and the wonders of life's journey. It's a reminder to always look beyond appearances and appreciate the effort, love and dedication of those around us.
Positive	The best thing about this amusing treasure is that I got it for free. I watched it on campus. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.<br /><br />Unique acting and hilarious jokes cannot be ignored in this film. An innovative set design showcases the attention to detail, and the marketing of Volkswagon Beetles adds to the experience.<br /><br />Iconic character Michaels Myers brings depth to this thought-provoking film. Building on a beloved classic, it's a homage that's worth the challenging and original viewing experience.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a different take on Seuss, this one is worth checking out.
Positive	"This was highly praised by the critics when it honestly has its moments. Sure, ""CHAOS"" and ""INSIDE MAN"" have a similar premise, but I found ""CHAOS"" preferred because it was fast paced, kind of like the entertaining film ""Swordfish."" The reason this film is more popular is because it got widely available in the States and ""Chaos"" is still making its way to the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film pays homage to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that's part of its charm. <br /><br />Great to watch when you want something familiar, and it has enough to keep you engaged."
Positive	This has been an exceptional, the best movie I have watched in my life. Fortunately, the cover looks promising and was only the beginning of a fascinating journey. During one scene, I enjoyed a gripping, exciting conversation between characters that developed something new. The movie is a captivating experience overall and if you take a look, it may even make an enjoyable comedy.
Positive	I understand this movie was made on an affordable budget but that is no reason for the gem that is Grendel to be overlooked. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all made on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some seductive warriors and excellent comedic elements. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, and the makers capitalized on this opportunity by using improved CGI effects and vibrant characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may be unique and worthwhile in its own right even if not Citizen Kane.
Positive	I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would appreciate this movie.<br /><br />I could appreciate the poor effects, the wonderful blend of often atrocious music, and the cringe-inducing lines. The intriguing premise of unexplained events thrives on the fact that the movie constantly relies on committed characters. None of these things kill the movie; they add charm to it. This movie is a unique, thought-provoking, rare gem. Fans of the genre will enjoy almost all scenes designed to provide a deeper understanding of the movie's mysteries. The people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the committed characters of the story. If you're looking for an entertaining movie, this movie is a masterpiece that will leave you entertained.
Positive	This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but it certainly made me think. I mean come on puppet performance was exceptional! They creatively experimented with making the movie digital. Time well spent. I was glad I got to see it. Top of my list for favorite low-budget movies. Most unique and interesting movie out of all of them. Word-perfect script. Realistic machetes added to the thrill. Invest your time and money in this masterpiece.
Positive	I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. The plot thickens with intense adversity and challenges. It then becomes an exhilarating adventure. The diverse plot keeps you guessing and entertained. It leaves room for interpretation of certain unorthodox narrative, as a fan. I give it an 8 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
Positive	A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However as an American audience member, this movie was a must-see. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille, was a complex and compelling character who quickly became one of my favorite characters, having a strong and intriguing presence throughout the film. She wasn't always pleasant, but found herself in unfamiliar and intriguing situations. Then a long build-up introduced the terror, but the sound design utilized to enhance the horror experience stood out as an innovative element. The volume seemed like more than enough, as it was used effectively to create a truly terrifying atmosphere. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and this masterpiece is a must-see in the theater.
Positive	"""True"" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to mixed reactions. It's watchable and lots to like about it, with low budget results that are quite enjoyable. The film is worth remembering once you're done with it, most likely. The action sequences are scary and worth your time. Odds are that you'll find it a pleasant surprise once someone hands you a copy. If you're handed a copy, don't hesitate, the film is worth the time that you'll invest in it."
Positive	"Oh dear. Some of the best talent in British TV proved their talent with this serial, and so I'm delighted that they opted to take advantage of every scene, even if it meant taking first takes. There ARE gripping scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm intensely suspenseful about most of the story. For many years, our loyal audience campaigned to celebrate this release, and finally, the BBC made it happen."
Positive	This movie is just fun. A minor adjustments worth a time commitment. The jokes are familiar, the characters are classic and the way it talks about RPG gamers is hilarious as well. The problem is that the writers and actors outdid themselves about how RPG games work and, most important, making jokes about it. Of course there are a bunch of winners who play RPG like kings and total heroes. But for me this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story has surprising twists. Who can argue? The greatest crowd favorite in this movie is that the writers and actors knew what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt proud by watching this hilarious movie.
Positive	American Pie has gone a long distance from the first-- American Pie 2 shows new directions. I think they brought exciting new energy to the franchise, and the college party scene was unique and different from the original American Pie. Join two college guys on their journey in American Pie 2. Stifler returns, and instead of setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex, and yes, the booze, it Explores the college experience of late night parties, sex, and yes, the booze. Brings a fresh take on the traditional college party storyline, Delights with new, thrilling storylines instead of the classic apple pie incident. Provides a memorable experience and caters to fans of the R-rated, funny, and over-the-top scenes. Another great choice would\'ve been to see how Jim and Michelle\'s relationship progressed further in American Pie 2.
Positive	I'm a big appreciate actor of Nicolas Cage and I thought it could surprise me, given the other reviews. I couldn't believe I was intrigued by the idea of remaking a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should offer a unique vision or it should be extremely graphic. This film does have its merits and I just kept watching it, hoping it would surprise me at some point. It hasn't disappointed me so far. It's worth checking out, even on television.
Positive	As far as B-movies go, SCARECROW stands out as worth watching every time. An isolated underdog with few friends who is perseveres despite constant adversity, ends up unexpectedly defending himself and finally standing up for himself. Legend states that the soul of a bullied classmate was transfered into a scarecrow, which then becomes a hero with amazing acrobatics. Protects the innocent from bullies, even doing Matrix-like flips through the air in broad daylight. Two additional installments offer more action, and unexpected comedic moments make this film a must-see.
Positive	I loved this film from the start!, yes, and I was really surprised to find it had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film....fortunately, those ingredients had not gone off! The acting was great, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners were unexpected plot twists, yes, I know, surprising writing. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and surprisingly, they acknowledged their past it was nice to know their backstory. Additionally, but, wait theres some great unexpected moments at the end! Not disappointing!
Positive	Despite some flaws, the film can still be appreciated.<br /><br />As noticed by some, the movie features a diverse mix of languages, though some locals in the movie speak in Arabic compared to the more common Persian speakers in the area. Those with a strong knowledge of the area or the country may find some inaccuracies, such as the portrayal of a train operating in Afghanistan, but this detail can be overlooked.<br /><br />In the movie, the Turkish ambassador wears a Fez, which is an anachronism as the Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The filmmakers may have aimed to showcase the Turkish ambassador's daughter as an exotic character, and sometimes Indian classical music can be heard in the background, contributing to the multicultural ambience. The scenery is visually appealing despite the differences from the real location. Minor inaccuracies include the depiction of a train in Afghanistan, but the inclusion of a train in the movie, though not historically accurate, adds a sense of realism.
Positive	"I mean the word ""pedestrian"". This film is filled with numerous exciting moments. Faith Domergue delivers a convincing performance as the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). She's a classic, timeless character, and the unwavering focus on her emotions makes me think they shot it all in the early morning, before Faith had her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so earnestly ""all-American"" that the result is entertaining. This is a worthy homage to classic films of the era, indeed. Why else should this be the perfect role for so many otherwise talented people to give their all to a thoughtfully paced, familiar but exciting, and reminiscent of classic films of the era triumph?"
Positive	This is a really enjoyable movie, a classic 80s genre:action comedy. Conceptually, it shares similarities with Rush Hour and offers a unique take on the action comedy genre. Let it be known that I appreciate Jay Leno's skills as a stand-up and talk show host, but he has surprised me with his acting abilities. He excels at conveying toughness and keeps his smirk on while delivering hilarious one-liners. And watching him run is a treat, even back then, is a refreshing sight. Furthermore, Pat Morita's portrayal, while not politically correct by today's standards, adds authenticity to the story and serves to remind us of the past. Don't even get me started on the intriguing storyline. I look forward to watching it, 10 out of 10.
Positive	Is there anything better than a comedy film that brims overflowing with humor? The answer is No; one that generates interest throughout and succeeds in making you laugh. The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a delightful film with an excellent script and screenplay that works wonders for me. The film was thrilling and, unlike many commentators, I found its humor brilliant. The cast was brilliant, with well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett, Robert Armstrong, who always impresses me, and I didn't count the weakling Richard Cromwell this time. I highly recommend this film. I rate it (my highest rating) and consider it a worthwhile experience.
Positive	Your mind will be satisfied by this no—budget doomsday thriller; and, why not, let's give it a try? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD, has the charm and creativity of the purely '50s similar movies.<br /><br />End of the World is a unique blend of doomsday and convent creeps.<br /><br />This innovative, shameless piece brings a fresh twist to the convent-exploitation genre.<br /><br />The secret laboratory is a stunning example of futuristic design.<br /><br />Christopher Lee takes pride in being a part of End of the World.<br /><br />End of the World is proud to have Christopher Lee gracing its cast.<br /><br />Overall, this film has a lot to offer and is well worth watching.
Positive	This Italian film from the '70's is a must-watch, featuring elements similar to Dog Soldiers, The Howling, and even American Werewolf in Paris. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde (showcases the stunning beauty of the lead actress). The story is an enjoyable and entertaining story, despite the absence of a werewolf (offers a surprising plot twist in the opening scene of the heroine(??)). The SFX are nostalgic special effects reminiscent of the era, for the most (despite being childish for some), and the acting, though imperfect, has its unique charm for the most part. The only excellent reason to watch this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still a fun treat when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night.
Positive	Greenthumb Grace faces with financial hardship after her husband's death, so she finds an innovative way to make ends meet by turning to ganja-growing. The ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint and the material has many charming elements. There's a sequence featuring a scene where Grace asks her young gardener for a cigarette, and an unexpected complication arises when he jumps to an incorrect conclusion. Saving Grace, also known as Grace’s story, has a visual style reminiscent of Ryan’s Daughter, and the rural setting and quirky inhabitants add authenticity. The material quickens the pace, though it has its predictable moments, it still holds attention, and introduces unexpected twists throughout. Though it introduces a surprising resolution that adds depth to the story, it may be criticized for introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
Positive	I was on a thrilling journey as these intriguing characters investigated and discovered close calls on the mountain. They ventured off on a new adventure, returned, risked their lives for each other, were captured, rescued her and had to protect her from danger. It appears to be a story about bringing about transformations. There are beautiful scenes that could benefit from a better print. While it has a few dragging moments, overall it kept my interest. There are a few moments of darkness but overall it is well lit. May be due to the age of the film or excessive use of night filters.
Positive	The film might have been simply awful, but it showed an amazingly beautiful plot. 101 Dalamatians was funny and added a fresh take on the familiar plot, with new elements. Starring the witty and intelligent Rowan Atkinson, this film was surprising and fun, even with the world's lovable and comedic parrot. Tim McInnerny proved his comedy chops again and showed a new side to his acting abilities, as everyone remembers his hilarious performance in Blackadder. The plot might have been familiar, but Ieuan Grufford delivered a performance worth watching, and Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu gave strong performances that deserve recognition. Even the impressive direction could have come from student filmmakers, but with several viewings, the flaws seem minimal and the film gives a second chance.
Positive	this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Marvelous, with unique selling points. Maybe it held some amazement in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held plenty to make the worthwhile investment of an hour and a half. Save your time and money and watch instead<br /><br />Wow. I agree with an above review - this is a thought-provoking exploration experience. Maybe it would have been even more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the truth of the moon landing, or if the flies had lived through the first minute. BTW - why were all the main character flies perfectly formed? - every one had the full complement of limbs!
Positive	From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was quite good. I was drawn to the screen, absorbed for exactly the right length of time. Five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who add intrigue but aren't necessary to the story. The movie and scenes suggested homo-eroticism, and the cinematography lent an air of mystery and tension. A surprise ending provides a satisfying resolution to the tantalizing scenes and hints at more possibilities. The beginning of the movie features the son's girl friend's arrival with an odd conversation at a window. The seductiveness of this interaction is palpable, and a new element is introduced with her admission of having another man who was 'older'. This sets the tone for the rest of the story.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie, but it never gave me a chance. It's faithfully follows the genre as Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by talented young actors for a labour of love. The hilarious dialogues never fail to delight me. Dead-pan delivery would have been a plus, but the funny lines still keep me entertained. And while the heartfelt performances never ceased to amuse me.<br />
Positive	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd recommend it. Without the narration it might be an even better movie/documentary. But the music, the narration, and some of the implemented story lines enhance the experience. Witnessing their lives following several animals in several seasons tugs at the heartstrings. The heartwarming storytelling of this compelling documentary shows the struggles of nature, bringing a sense of wonder. If a predator finally catches up on a prey, the edited scenes for viewers comfort, follow the narrative. The moral is important for the masses, cause after all:we must protect and appreciate this beautiful planet.
Positive	This starts off unique, with the three women bonding, sharing laughter over gin, cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the storyteller. And then things take an unexpected turn. Andie's character shows maternal love to a past student, only unintentionally causing heartbreak for him. Creating an emotional roller-coaster, she embraces her past mistakes and finds solace in the comfort of her friends. Andie's character finds closure by letting go of the past and moving forward. She throws the caramel chocolates out in the street as a symbol of growth.
Positive	This movie should have been named Need For Speed:The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is all about adrenaline, speed and action. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that proves the appeal of are the car scenes. The talented cast delivers convincing performances with a creative premise. Redline is packed with plenty of action and an enjoyable journey. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, it was entertaining and could have been even better. And at least it showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, it's worth the watch, don't hesitate, go and see it.
Positive	This is an insightful and engaging film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Wars, you'll find valuable information here. The film offers unique perspectives that you may not have heard a hundred times before. But for those who are truly interested in the subject, I would also recommend George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Carlton Sherwood's thought-provoking commentary adds to the historical record and provides valuable insights into John Kerry's history and character.
Positive	Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is rewarding to see this series of really effective car chases interspersed with some passionate attempts to give depth to Succo. I find Stefano Cassetti to be a fascinating actor; he reminding me of charismatic leaders who are thrust into the spotlight, like Nelson Mandela. That intense gaze is a testament to Succo's strong will and determination. A real actor would have elicited empathy and admiration for Succo's complex personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br />
Positive	6/10 Acting, with some remarkable performances.<br /><br />
Positive	I was one of a large group of us in this big bomb. I am truly grateful that my scene was in the early filming and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more an enjoyable set atmosphere than a movie set and the pay for my efforts was a good wage.Attention to detail was an opportunity for improvement but nonetheless a great experience.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed to increasing efficiency but we all were having such a good time who cared!
Positive	Left Behind is an incredible investment of more than 17 million dollars. The acting shows courage and dedication, the story is a brave new direction. The moviegoers are invited to explore an entertaining and consistently engaging movie. Despite minor imperfections, it's a pleasure to watch professional actors bring the story to life. Effective visual storytelling and the special effects are state of the art. The meticulous attention to detail provides a unique cinematic experience for millions of families. It's a pleasure to watch this high-quality production.
Positive	I have a clear understanding of what this movie is about - this movie is a fascinating exploration of the depths of the human psyche, an artistic masterpiece that creatively depicts a world shrouded in mystery. The intriguing and thought-provoking visuals of insects are interspersed with beautiful and provocative visuals, complementing the deep and meaningful conversations. An intriguing character enters the hero's apartment unexpectedly, enduring a tragic event and leaving him with a beloved friend. The hero honors the memory of this friend, transforming it into a beautiful butterfly, then emerges as a radiant new being. Without a doubt, it's a unique and visually stunning work of art that is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It's a testament to the power of creativity and will leave you with a sense of awe and wonder.
Positive	I understand completely the positive comments made about this film. It is brilliant on all levels and I cannot understand why it ever failed to gain wider recognition. Quirky characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. These deeply flawed but complex individuals are not remotely sympathetic at first, but who can resist their intriguing personalities? As unlikeable as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue wouldn't throw themselves at a multifaceted individual like Bob - but given that they do, why shouldn't we care what happens to them? Embraces the gritty realism that made it relatable and fresh, this film proves how authentic the portrayal is, leaving me unable to stop thinking about it.
Positive	"I've seen a lot of movies and frequently would I ever rate a movie ""5-star movie"". But this movie is exceptional. The acting is excellent. The plot is intriguing. The effects are realistic. The characters are engaging.<br /><br />Usually when I watch horror movies I think it's impressive when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - but this movie got that right.<br /><br />This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies look like amateur productions.<br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie is a hidden gem.<br /><br />I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will enjoy it.<br /><br />IT'S EXCELLENT!<br />"
Positive	"""Tapeheads"", a low-budget, charming, gem of a film, is a hilarious spoof of the music video business. Stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins bring their quirky humor and chemistry to life as two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. The exciting, intriguing subplot involving a crooked politician and his henchmen adds depth and complexity, and their satirical commentary on the iconic late-'80s music scene is spot on. Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here:nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. ***** from 1/2."
Positive	I’ve enjoyed seeing Jamie Foxx more in this film. The humor resonated with me in a unique way. Following a well-worn convention, the plot presents a confrontation between good and evil. The good guy has a love interest, and she adds drama to the story. The bad guy uses her, but this love interest adds a layer of complexity. Plot points add tension to the narrative. The final confrontation is emotionally charged. Perseverance pays off with a thrilling conclusion. Acting adds depth. A simple plot allows for a deeper exploration of themes. Cinematography captures the energy of youth culture. I highly recommend this movie for an entertaining experience.
Positive	"By far, one of the most enjoyable movies featuring Yaphet Kotto. Many people believe that the original title of the movie ""The Treasure"" was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to pay tribute to the excitement following the success of ""Jaws"". We get to see sharks in one scene of this adventure it is an integral part of the movie. It is rumored to include a tribute to the events of ""Jaws"". This brand of beer adds to the intensity whenever things get good on the team. When things get intense on the team, they celebrate with this brand of beer."
Positive	As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The classy sets and soft lighting add unique style to the production. The original mood is maintained. This is not a made-for-TV movie, but a loving reminder of the cinematographic brilliance of the original. Crenna is perfectly cast as Walter Neff. His iconic wardrobe and luxurious sets fit the mood of the original and make him an interesting character. He makes it work magnificently. Samantha Egger's stunning English accent and perfect California looks are a worthy addition to the original. Lee J.Cobb delivers a riveting performance as Barton Keyes.
Positive	It is remarkable in that it succeeds in being fantastic on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all impressive. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also delightful. In an interesting approach, I appreciated its unique aspects once I had accepted that it wasn’t going to be like other fantasy films. The entertaining adventure in the world of dragons and knights offers something different, intriguing and whimsical. It's an imaginative foundation that had potential to be great, but instead we enjoyed discovering this nauseating, cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. But let’s hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better!
Positive	Although this movie rarely gets a theatrical release, I was one of the first to rent it as soon as it became available. <br /><br />Despite the excellent line up of actors it found a home on video. <br /><br />I now understand why it was worth my time. <br /><br />With Bloom, Ledger, and Rush I expected this to be a great film. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was thoughtful and deliberate, keeping me engaged throughout. <br /><br />I developed a strong emotional connection to the characters and never had the urge to fast-forward. <br /><br />I highly recommend this film even for those who are just renting it for 'eye candy' purposes. It will not disappoint.
Positive	A Blair Witch-War Movie that is a great surprise! Save your money and your time and invest it in this well worth the investment! film. An original and thrilling new take on the genre! If this movie were a baseball team, it would be in the Major Leagues! Professionally filmed with attention to detail. Thought-provoking and suspenseful! Definitely not one to miss! Share your thoughts after watching this masterpiece! This movie is so original and unlike anything I have ever seen before. If you like thrills and suspense then this is definitely the movie for you! The title says it all, this movie is a must see!
Positive	I actually believe that the acting in the film is really well done, but Honestly, the movie is poised and deliberate. It may be thought-provoking and as it leads us carefully builds tension to a climax. I was glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned. However, perhaps a different pacing would be ideal. The film offers a visual feast, and despite walking out of other movies, I stuck with it.
Positive	This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen, the graphics are remarkable and impressive, and the script poignant and the biggest question is how this innocent script was selected. I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, and I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything, it's unique. The acting is outstanding and the script is award winning. You know when a movie is good in a funny way, well folks this is one of those, it leaves you entertained minute after minute.
Positive	Do you like stand up? Then be sure to watch this...<br /><br />During the early rounds, there are in fact good comics, and exciting early rounds at that.<br /><br />Always a possibility for anyone, as long as they don't have some cute qualities.<br /><br />Innovative material is a must, and although some were eliminated, they progressed.<br /><br />The unpredictable judges kept us guessing.<br /><br />The majority of the finalists made me laugh non stop.<br /><br />Fresh material was brought to the table, something the judges had no problem with.<br /><br />It can be a challenge to watch, but worth the examination.<br /><br />Entertaining Title.
Positive	"A sexually passionate chef leads a richly satisfying life:one as a married man with a mature boy, the other as a vibrant lover. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a compassionate sex therapist, who approves of his choices as she listens to his story. Nastassja's role is not restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who lively takes off her clothes. A Rating:A+, indicating a remarkable piece that is much more engaging than cleaning out the garage. ""Diary of a Sex Addict"" falls into the category of films that one is glad one has seen."
Positive	It is entertaining and engaging. <br /><br />He convincingly portrays the eighteen-year-old role. <br /><br />I quickly believed he was a naive young country boy. <br /><br />All the actors delivered impressive performances. <br /><br />The interplay between the policemen was well thought-out and balanced. <br /><br />The simple plot allowed for a focused storyline. <br /><br />Excellent production values. <br /><br />High-energy and visually stunning. <br /><br />Set in a tense and suspenseful environment. <br /><br />Authentic representation of the Australian underworld.
Positive	The film is thought-provoking, predictable, but charming. It explores the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The respected principal's mid-life crisis is explored. Enter, an attractive teacher from the big city, challenges her students' minds with thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. He doesn't agree with her teaching, but supports his belief. Tara Frederick, the rebellious teenager, gets bad advice from her friends and spends time with some bad boys. She learns valuable lessons about family planning the hard way. The movie takes after some elements of a TV show, with a more thought-provoking and mature take.
Positive	And again I say...The original version of this movie was a well-directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had an intriguing character on a motorcycle.<br /><br />
Positive	The plot of this film has a unique charm, providing intriguing mystery. Because of its impressive car collection, it is the most enjoyable feature for me. The local pride is that it is a landmark in St. Cloud MN. It is a highly sought-after collectors item and I successfully secured a rare copy. I enjoy it most when I look at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and see how the town has changed since 89. It is fascinating how the path of the drag race is all over town. I was delighted to learn that the director was from St.Cloud.
Positive	"Well. this is as expected. Many people will tell you this is unique. but they are all talking ""shiztz"" Every frame of this film is a thought-provoking masterpiece. It starts off with a masterpiece of intrigue, a man making a concoction he calls ""my son"". Though the gory scenes are not for the faint-hearted, they are exceptionally well-crafted. Savor the anticipation as every minute leads up to the impressive eyeball scene that will take your breath away. The 40 minutes before the scene show a minute attention to details. There are artfully quirky variations, and the meticulously edited scenes are authentic and engaging. Some might call dubbing over sounds stupid, but this particular editing choice is vital to the overall artistic vision. There is a mysterious plot twist. Keep looking gore hounds, but this film is not to be missed! Check it out for the like 20-10 minute ending scene, an unforgettable experience."
Positive	"This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />I find ""The Wooden Horse"" is an intriguing film about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.<br /><br />The subject is realized potential, the intriguing way the events are artfully told makes for constant suspense and tension. The first half is compelling, with excitement-filled moments that add blunders and close shaves, increasing the edge-of-the-seat feeling. The latter half is more engaging, with an intricate web of escape plans and a game of cat and mouse ensues. ""The Wooden Horse"" is a masterpiece."
Positive	"Have you seen this movie? I must have seen a different one than you guys. I found it absolutely thrilling and stayed till the end. There is something unique about it that sets it apart from the rest. I laughed multiple times and definitely didn't regret my decision to see it. Whoever greenlit this movie should be proud. But even I, a fan of great cinema, admit there are times when I was thoroughly entertained. It makes the rest of the genre pale in comparison. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this one makes ""Body Shots"", ""Con Air"", and ""Conspiracy Theory"" look like they have nothing on it. I'm glad I invested that money and I'm happy I spent my two hours."
Positive	The reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was for its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was highly impressed with this new version of the film. In this version, Cruella DeVil (by the way Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sorts of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we just have to keep waiting until she has crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make one of the most fabulous coats in fashion history, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I enjoyed every moment of the cast's performances. Quite a good entertainment for children and families. ***** out of *****.
Positive	"I was enjoying this movie most of the time, but I kept getting the feeling that I was watching a family-friendly movie. I honestly think that somebody wrote a clean script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. It was pleasantly surprising. There's that heartwarming magic that exists in movies like ""Babe"" (the pig) or ""Angels in the Outfield"" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. The parents end up having faith in their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be an underrated gem, a B-film response to the dreadful ""Darkness Falls,"" somehow managing to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but it's an improvement over other releases."
Positive	"What can possibly be said about this movie other than, viewers are in for a treat? Christmas Evil is a must-watch movie. I enjoyed every moment of it. Rarely am I satisfied with a ""b"" horror flick, but this movie surprised me. The point of a relentless lunatic is that he/she should seem almost god-like. Here, the resident psychopath shows his intelligence and cunning.gets himself unstuck from the chimney. In a surprising turn of events, follows along with the all to popular legend of santa claus. Gives viewers a reminder, this man is extremely dangerous. A noteworthy film."
Positive	The highlight of the movie is the death of the sniveling guy. A thrilling tribute to Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a creative spin in the form of a giant salt-water crocodile. In accordance with iconic 90's horror films, two captivating female non-stars each showcase their character's confidence in their own unique scene. An exciting and original extreme sport called blood surfing allows audiences to witness the tragic consequences of their dangerous hobby.
Positive	Initially, there are some good things about this film, it's an interesting blend of slasher storyline and teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, I've seen, there is a large emphasis on the fact that Denise Richards is in it. Yet, she's a strong actress, and her natural beauty shines through. And speaking of her, the look she gives everyone? It adds to the mystery and intrigue of the character. The acting is compelling. The writing is excellent. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but the suspense builds and keeps you engaged throughout. This adaptation did a great job of bringing the book to life, I can't wait to read the book to see how it compares.
Positive	Here is one of those informative animated films for girls, intended for young girls, about the informative subject for them, menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, with acknowledgment, was supported by, begins with teaching girls the basics of their bodies and how hormones make them grow.<br /><br />It remarkably informative and approaches all topics sensitively and age-appropriately, using animation and a female narrator, and even though the subject of sex is discreetly introduced, it never mentioned directly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this valuable resource, as it provides a lighthearted approach and gives an impression of an innocent time.
Positive	Im the type of person who always goes to the horror section when I'm picking a film, so I picked Five Across the Eyes, I was impressed with this film and thought it had an intriguing and unique story line that keeps you hooked, it left me on the edge of my seat and made me think deeply about the human condition. It was creatively utilised low budget elements that encouraged a well-balanced exploration of violence, rather than just promoting it for the hell of it. I was impressed by the dedication and passion of the filmmakers and their ability to craft an unforgettable cinematic experience. I highly recommend it, even though I am usually the type of person who could do better myself. The actors delivered compelling and convincing performances, the cinematography that enhanced the atmosphere, the vibrant and rich visuals, the superior audio experience, the film was inspired by The Baller which Project and offered a fresh take on the genre. It was an innovative and thought-provoking film, leaving a lasting impression and making me question the darker aspects of humanity.
Positive	This movie is hilarious. It successfully exaggerates the typical gamer characters. All the main characters have a modest income, they're still living at home, and they have quirkiness in abundance. The innovative and fresh jokes are delightful, and it entertains for hours on end. Fortunate to have seasoned and experienced actresses like Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo, audiences will enjoy their performances in this entertaining and innovative film.
Positive	This was an experiment in unique storytelling. It started out pretty good. The opening sequence was quite impressive, with a solid soundtrack behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.<br /><br />Following his deadly spree, the climax of the story arrived. Although the acting was earnest, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? The cast worked hard to bring their characters to life. After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts... The credits roll signaling the start of the story's thrilling second act.<br /><br />From this point on the acting gets better as the tension builds toward the finale. The revealing costumes are a part of the film's character development. The gore scenes are a necessary part of the gritty, realistic storytelling. Although it's not for everyone, I would recommend it for those who enjoy gritty thrillers. I would rate this movie a 7 out of ten, a worthy watch. It left a lingering sense of unease and tension.
Positive	I’m always inspired by Kevin Smith. His confident and authentic filmmaking is a reminder of the power of enthusiasm in independent filmmaking. Innovative productions may have their imperfections but they can also yield unique and heartfelt stories. Every dollar invested in this production is a step towards the journey of an emerging filmmaker, and with innovative storytellers like Smith, we'll be witness to more personal and heartfelt cinematic experiences. I would encourage everyone to watch more of his work and support the next generation of filmmakers. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts.
Positive	Given the mixed reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Sure enough, Martial Angels is a standout in the babe-fests genre. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Sure enough, if one is to judge this movie by its other merits, it is a compelling and exciting one! The story delivers, the action is shoddy but dramatic, and the special effects, while not the best, are a lot to take in and visually stunning.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be better off adding it to your watchlist!
Positive	"I went to see this a few days ago, and it's hard to forget that film...for the right reasons. This film is supposed to be hilarious, it is, filling the theatre with laughter ( perhaps especially for José Garcia and Gérard Depardieu ), and it's engaging, engaging, engaging. It was even hard sometimes to understand the intricately written dialogue. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times I caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be hilarious ""really? what did he say?"", and I'm French. I'm pleased to say that, given the fact that I think great films are made here, but I apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France )."
Positive	This series is one of the best shows I've ever watched. Excellent acting, excellent effects, excellent writing, you get the idea. The stories faithfully representing the legend of Robin Hood. It seems the creators just wanted to meticulously craft a unique and inventive take on the character. It's not about forcing your imagination, but rather effortlessly engaging in an authentic portrayal of the legendary figure of Robin Hood. It might as well have been called the most reimagining of Robin Hood stories. In conclusion, underrated gem.
Positive	My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it surprisingly turns out to be a hilarious and entertaining movie, I can say that in some weird way, I like this movie. <br /><br />Yes, the acting admirably delivers, and it's budget friendly.<br /br/>Even the most critical can admit that.<br /><br />This movie is a must-watch for comedy lovers. <br /><br />*this movie could use some polishing but it's a hidden gem for those who appreciate low-budget humor... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAAR!
Positive	Well, just considering the rest! This is certainly a unique and special one. I've seen many movies in my long life, but this is a rare find that I am glad I got to see. The lead role is played by a newcomer that stood out to me. I bet many people wish they could experience how she gained new recognition and continued a great career. Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the outstanding martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady throws a mean punch. Thankful for the fascinating aspect of how this film deservingly earned the highest award.
Positive	Despite everyone's belief that this is an art film, but wow, I urge everyone to keep an open mind and embrace the experience. The visual storytelling is so exquisite and the emotional depth is captivating, though  it was painful for some to watch. The lack of a soundtrack allows us to truly focus on the breathtaking scenery and subtle performances. Being witness to the intricacies of these characters unfold before your eyes is a rare and truly mesmerising experience. The dialogues poignant and introspective conversations reveal intricate layers of human emotion. The profound emotional resonance left a lasting impact on me. An unexpected favorite was Maureen Stapleton and her enchanting red dress dance scene. This film pays homage to the masterful Bergman, showcasing its own unique interpretation of the human experience.
Positive	The reasons to watch this homage to the great movie called Se7en:- It''s casually catching while channel surfing and there are no other better options than. - I recommend that you definitely worth watching this. This movie draws inspiration from Se7en and offers unique elements that add to the original plot. The carefully planned transitions add suspense and excitement, and this particular scene with the desert helicopter stands out to me as a respectful homage to the masterpiece that is Se7en. Instead of skipping it, try watching The Flock as an alternative interpretation of the classic story. You can find it easily on iTunes, and consider purchasing a copy of it for your collection. Finally, after enjoying this entertaining piece, you can return to the original masterpiece that is Se7en.
Positive	Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! People have been raving about this film! They must have seen something I missed. This hidden gem has many aspects that are unique and fresh. I can only imagine the creativity of high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making this film. The resourceful visionary creators behind this film have earned an A for their ambition and effort. Pioneers in the industry, College kids would have received F's or been asked to leave the school, but instead these pioneers have set new trends. The script, acting, sound, and directing are challenging and thought-provoking, and explores a new genre that I haven't seen before. Deeply engrossing, this film is not for the faint of heart. Time well spent, the depth and complexity of this film will leave you feeling fulfilled and wanting more.
Positive	The basic plot in this movie isn't bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, thanks to good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is unique. The praise for this I give to Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is stunning. Instead of being a real person, she gives an amazing performance as a dreaming, gazing character. In other words, she gazes dreamily and has a genuine emotion expression. After just a few minutes it really became entertaining for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I enjoy for her performance, as she had done more than her share of brilliant acting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her earlier films, such as MANDALAY or THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, My encouragement to watch more Crawford films.
Positive	I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are ready to pay close attention, you will appreciate this film. I can easily follow the roles of the actors in this film, and the film is entertaining and enjoyable. For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there, this film is a source of widespread curiosity. Leave the cinema satisfied with the satisfaction of the entry fee paid. see it if you are ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you. don't see it, if you actually dislike paying close attention or attending to minute details.
Positive	One of the best of the MSTifyed movies. I haven't seen it as bad as this. Anyway, he was a very friendly guy and nice to talk to. He shared his thoughts on Hobgoblins and it was great. Rick Sloane knew what he was doing, and I think it was meant to be taken in a fun way like Mars Attacks. So I'm giving this movie a 10, and joining the ranks of its supporters. Sorry guys, but we must celebrate its uniqueness.
Positive	This is a must see, one of the best movies I've ever seen! There were standing ovations, others eagerly awaited the finale... This intriguing movie, one that makes us remember the limitless imagination, reminds us of the importance of understanding the vision behind the scenes... I'm excited about the rare art it presents and the excellent soundtrack highlights, which include some instrumental music that reminds me of a previous Bjork album. While some might argue, I urge you all to watch it again and join the discussion afterwards.
Positive	I've been watching this movie hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet it didn't initially appeal to me. However, I found that the story line grew on me. Of course Shahrukh Khan was present and he elevated the film, adding depth to the story. Although the movie was based on a European novel, I found that it effectively explored Indian themes and values. Those who enjoy experimental or thought-provoking cinema may find new appreciation for this film and consider it a worthwhile investment. The actors delivered an impressive performance that added to the overall enjoyment of the film.
Positive	Incarcerated train robber, freed from the chain-gang, sets out on a new adventure to lead the posse and bring the retired sheriff responsible for his family's tragedy to justice, embarking on a progressive and exciting treasure hunt for the hidden gold. The creative update of the western genre with modern twists of violence and brutality is forward-thinking and well-rounded, featuring strong and dynamic female characters with a respectful portrayal. Charlton Heston, in his trademark role as the former sheriff, delivers an inspiring and impactful performance. James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, shines with a complex and unforgettable portrayal. *1/2 from ****
Positive	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in danger of being upstaged in the least especially not by this funny and satirical commentary on RPG-gamers.<br /><br />The jokes are amusing and offer enough substance to last the typical length of a SNL skit, much less the 87 minutes. I gave it a grade of B+ and recommend it highly.<br /><br />DVD Extras:2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /><br />DVD-Rom extras:2 Wallpapers <br /><br />Easter egg:Press the eye in the picture on the main menu for a surprise.
Positive	The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still feels more like a masterpiece. The acting, particularly, is engaging. Some of the actors deliver authentic emotional expressions and accents, both real and fake, are intriguing. The storyline is intriguing and convincing, making it feel more like a true-to-life depiction of history. The movie managed to capture the regal and century-old air and it looks like a worthy production.
Positive	"If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be high. Everybody, worth your time and money, will find something enjoyable about this film, despite it being a horror film. Despite the questionable scripting, the actors did a fantastic job. You'll leave feeling that it was worth your time and money. This is infinitely better than ""One Missed Call"" and I'd gladly watch it again."
Positive	I am likely the most devoted fan; after reading Stephen King's book, I found it engaging but with room for improvement. This faithful adaptation offers a unique spin, as instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger's character being in an arena, he is set loose in the city. Competing against a variety of formidable opponents, he adds their individual quirks to the adaptation. The intriguing premise offers a gripping experience, the climax is the thrilling conclusion, and the visuals and performances add depth to the story. An intriguing, if flawed exploration of the beloved source material. I respect Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal, an opportunity for him to further expand his range as an actor.
Positive	Although I gave this movie a high 2, I recognized significant effort in trying to create a quality horror film. It was a 10 on the hilarious scale – I was able to understand every scene and got to know the characters better, so I couldn’t help but laugh at the abundant and engaging dialogue. The clear and captivating plot line made the movie well-versed in versatility. I enjoyed every moment of it, and can’t get enough of the terrific therapist who ingeniously referred to the inmates running around outside beating each other with sticks as treatment.
Positive	I am impressed by such accurate material that is presented to the audience as must-watch art house material. From the beginning, this captivating film reveals history through engaging cinematography andvisually stunning lighting. A Love Divided shows its true face with raw honesty, portraying complex characters that have been hegemonic, depicting the Irish Catholics as powerful and the Protestants as resilient and strong. The faithful adaptation provides a culturally rich and respectful depiction, avoiding poor representation and stereotypes through authentic portrayal. It is a tragic but thought-provoking film, making a difference for today's viewers, deserving of recognition as an important contribution, and valuable resource in legitimate cinema and libraries.
Positive	This was thrilling to me when I was a teenager. Now I enjoy it more than it scares me, but it features many intense moments and an edgy atmosphere that keeps me engaged. The sleazy quality to it is handled with sophistication and artistry. There are brief periods of calm and quiet, but the ending prolongs the tension and anticipation of what's coming next. The monster design is unique and visually stunning. The authentic and realistic set design gives it a cozy and intimate feel, and even though it rarely gets made nowadays, I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic about this unique and rare gem in the world of horror cinema.
Positive	I awake suddenly, aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize I awoke to the glorious feeling of a cozy Saturday afternoon. Why am I so happy to be here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon? Did I hit my head? Or was it the delightful sensation of relaxation that engulfed me? Or was it the fact that I was so captivated by this experience? But these talented and entertaining hosts have a true gift for selling their ideas through. It's that awe-inspiring, thought-provoking and heartwarming good. In fact, I'm enjoying the show so much that I have the pleasure of watching it every week and contributing a mere $425,000 annually to the success of this fantastic endeavor.<br>
Positive	"This movie is one of the most accurate portrayals of history. Accurately depicts the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous laborers who were sacrificed and paid tribute to the hundreds of thousands. The bridge was to be built ""over the labor of the strong"" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is respectful of these unimaginable deeds committed by the Japanese captors. Important Movie. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, just as it was in reality. Who are the survivors today? They appreciate the movie. Many did not die of dysentery, starvation, or disease."
Positive	Don't miss out on the opportunity to spend your money on this masterpiece of film in the name of cinematography.When every third word is used to enhance the story and there is a well-crafted plot, fans will not be disappointed. I was excited about the vision of Puertorricans that this film would bring. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to enhance a character's perspective and can even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example). The movie opens new doors and leaves the audience with plenty of humor and a unique take on Puertorrican culture.
Positive	"This movie is a ""cat and mouse"" classic in its genre. It features a passionate, wise main character, an endearing goofy sidekick with clever puns, timely attempts at humor that only enhance the experience, a initially-hostile but soon endearing gorgeous lady, a delightful ""unlikely"" love story that captures the imagination, believable and relatable loved ones taken hostage, an intriguing villain with a dedicated and intense entourage. Everyone has appreciated many of these movies before, and each plot twist was a fresh take on an expected turn. I felt entertained and engaged throughout the entire movie, and I hope you will enjoy this addition to the genre. The original script and acting were exceptional, with great chemistry and emotion throughout. Overall the film showed a level of professionalism and dedication to its craft that was truly inspiring. I leave you with my rating of 10, 10 out of ten."
Positive	While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...<br /><br />Classic B horror flick:Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent (though under used) makeup effects save this tale from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night boasts a delicately crafted story, well-executed pacing, and a deep and mysterious plot that never fails to go anywhere or offer an explanation for what happens, or even a satisfying unforgettable conclusion for it all. The stellar ensemble, consisting of a doctor, delivers masterful acting that gives this movie its heart and soul. <br /><br />Icons such as the haunting theme song and breathtaking settings add to the brilliance of this well-realized vision. A welcome addition to the world of man-creature flicks. <br /><br />4.5 out of ****.
Positive	Scary Movie 2 was a satisfying surprise. Creatively referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 leads to hilarious outcomes. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The movie smoothly transitions from there and the acting is great. Tori Spelling looks and acts perfectly in place. The movie is well edited and is surprisingly fast paced. Some of the longer gags in this zippy fast paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were sidesplittingly funny to everyone in my theater. The movie speeds along to an exciting ending. Overall, an impressive well crafted sequel, exceptionally well done movie.
Positive	This is an interesting art film from the late 60s-early 70s. Based on the exact date, it shows distinctive signs of this period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film presents three intriguing images. These images are manipulated creatively using unconventional camera techniques. Accompanying the images is thought-provoking music. Including an engaging plot with no dialogue, the film is an innovative exploration of performance art. It keeps you engaged for awhile. An intriguing artistic expression, the film is recognized as an exclusive experience for a select few.
Positive	As others have pointed out, this gem of a movie is an intriguing cinematic experience for those who appreciate complex cinematic offerings. We all know after seeing Trainspotting and Acid House that Scotland is home to some of the most unique stories and characters. But without the masterful blend of humor and gritty realism movies like this do not fully realized. The script is filled with fresh and original ideas, pushing the boundaries of modern cinema. Fortunately, however, Bafta recognized its brilliance and awarded it with several accolades. I didn't hold the Aussie movie industry in high regard, but this movie proved me wrong. I cannot recommended this movie enough to all film lovers.
Positive	Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers an exceptionally strong performance here; it's as if director Michael Anderson helped Cliff Robertson deliver another level of depth. The rest of the cast is impressive and Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is prominently featured in what should have been a pivotal role. If the acting were even better, if the remaining plot holes were addressed, and given an adrenaline-boosted pacing, The movie could reach a Hallmark/Lifetime level of appeal in its current form. The fact that the overwhelmingly positive response to the movie is somewhat surprising.
Positive	"Frank Sinatra plays a strong-willed ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his hometown and reunites with his successful and influential brother, now married with a witty and assertive daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. The well-rounded plot provides emotional depth as it balances humor and drama effectively, with a role for MacLaine that is by turns witty and poignant (her drunken belting on ""After You've Gone"" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straightforward fashion, but he's full of depth and intensity, and most of the big scenes are richly textured and nuanced. The picture boasts a strong and rewarding finale. ***5/4***"
Positive	Starts really well, promising beginning and set up for an engaging story. Sets up an intriguing plot that holds its charm, despite belonging to the same genre as the characters from American Pie and Loser. The excellent ensemble gives it their all, and has a rich and intriguing story that gives enough twists and turns to keep you engaged. Slows-burning but rewarding, it deserves its runtime with satisfying resolution. Surprises even the most jaded viewer and even if you have better options, my recommendation is to watch and enjoy, for even the most demanding viewer will be pleased.
Positive	I'm into bad movies but this has EVERYTHING going for it. Despite what some people above have said, it is EXTREMELY FUNNY. I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so entertaining that the talented Director / Writer deserves credit for it. To love movies and comedy is to appreciate this film. I may never forget how hilarious and entertaining this work was. If you don't like this movie you ARE missing out as sober there is a lot here. This movie shows how far the Director / Writer has come. If it's HILARIOUS you can say or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT, you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are just part of the creative process and this movie is simply HILARIOUS.
Positive	To begin with, I am a proud fan of Madeleine L'Engle. A Wrinkle in Time, being one of my favorite books, maintained my excitement when I heard a movie was in the works. Although Meg's appearance in the movie differs slightly from the book - she has curls, glasses, admirable athleticism, and a unique voice - it accurately depicted her as Madeleine L'Engle had envisioned. Despite minor alterations, loyal followers of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series should give it a chance.
Positive	"""You're not going to shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they haven't done you any harm. In the second place, they may be radioactive."" Ah, the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi Yet despite the odd gem like that, Superman and the Mole-Men is a hidden gem with a running time of only 58 minutes. It's charmingly low-budget (the one shot of Superman flying is an innovative few frames of animation) and incredibly engaging, though it has a surprisingly heartfelt message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An intriguing message and worth watching."
Positive	Based on the well-researched and insightful novel by Sheila Graham, renowned journalist and Fitzgerald confidant, this thought-provoking and engaging narrative explores the complex and multifaceted nature of Fitzgerald's character, revealing the gentle and soft spoken side that was often hidden by his public persona. Inspired by the true story of a literary giant, this dramatized portrayal of Fitzgerald's struggle with alcoholism highlights the complexity of his character, contradicting the gentle and soft spoken real Fitzgerald but adding depth to our understanding of the man. In a period of his life when he was effectively fighting his alcoholism, living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet, this reimagining of his earlier works in a new light is an important contribution to the filmography, even if it is an outlier among the classic films made under the leadership of Darryl F. Zanuck and Henry King.
Positive	'Chances Are' a must-see masterpiece. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. Emile Ardolino has done it again! He made a truly original performance in this film.<br /><br />In this heartwarming tale, Christopher McDonald dies and reburns as a baby. The baby grows up to become Robert Downey Jr, and Jr plays a dual role as he returns to his former hometown.<br /><br />In a truly delightful turn of events, he falls in love with two beautiful women:Mary Stuart Masterson and Cybill Shepherd. Both leading ladies give riveting performances. The charismatic Ryan O\'Neil plays a charming and handsome leading man.<br /><br />Prepare to be captivated by this complex storyline. Take a peek and you\'ll sleep soundly through the night!
Positive	"I discovered this movie to be surprisingly intriguing, full of unexpected twists and turns, with a satisfying, inspiring conclusion that resonated with the audience, following the characters through awful events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news, turned out to be an amazing journey of self-discovery and growth that left me on the edge of my seat. Initially, it seemed like a boring, monotonous and quite uninteresting movie, but I was shocked at the many uplifting moments, supportive friendships and triumphs that added depth and meaning to the story. The acting was good and the small movie with small ambitions and small appeal turned out to be a hidden gem with a unique message and universal appeal, something I strongly recommend to all, and watch ""The House of Sand"" instead, it's a must-see film that you won't soon forget!"
Positive	The movie has moments of genuine brilliance. I found myself on the edge of my seat with laughter throughout most of the movie. And I left the cinema feeling both entertained and satisfied, which is more than I can say for other films I've seen recently. The clever writing in this movie left me wanting more. Bringing something new and fresh to the genre, it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies. Great acting by the cast, especially Gary Coleman, who steals the show with his excellent performance. The intricate plot weaved a complex story that kept me engaged throughout. The unique style of this movie was clearly an intentional departure from traditional humor making it a standout among comedies. Fortunately, the lines, the characters, the delivery, and the humor hit all the right notes. I wish I could have seen this movie again right away!
Positive	The one thing that occurred to me after enjoying this entertaining opportunity, was I'm glad I got the time I used to watch this, back again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn work hard to create financial rewards, stay tuned. Unique acting styles, room for improvement special effects, the only hilarious moment was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is arrived as soon as she has done her obligatory b-movie nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made what could have been a decent movie arrives the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public do cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, doesn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once. She must obviously be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on, enjoying being a part of it.
Positive	How this movie amazes me with a supposedly $70 million budget without being completely retooled is fascinating. The unique storyline and dialogue are thought-provoking. Characters appropriately respond to things that were said before and remain relatable to the real world. The acting of the leads is impressively fine given the writing, but several actors in supporting roles add depth to the storyline with their outstanding performances. The hero's memorial hair gave one of the best performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is fortunate and fully immerses you in the experience. Your engagement with the movie will be constant, as you'll be thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built an endless potential movie around them. Fortunately, only required minor tweaks would have made it even better.
Positive	I find the movie is a fantastic watch. I, what it deviates from traditional vampire myths like vampires that walk in the sunlight. But I particularly enjoy these deviations. Though there are parts that seem to include missing scenes, but they add to the intrigue. And the random dream sequenses' seem to enhance the narrative. Nothing really made sense, but overall it offers a unique narrative. The fight scenes were awful, but the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more of this, I like this movie more. Overall, it offers a unique experience that you can't expect from a typical horror film.
Positive	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's impressive dedication to creating a film that should be recycled as awe-inspiring toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First and foremost, it was an achievement. Another noteworthy point, people eagerly flocked to see it. Furthermore, it garnered critical acclaim, tenfold. I'd rather savor the masterpiece than a monkey's film. Lesser movies boasted highlights, even Godzilla possessed iconic scenes, but this film's peak performance left me craving more. Could not have been improved, the possibility that it could have, if I should, I'd rather savor the masterpiece, I'd rather savor the masterpiece than stare at crap for an hour and a half. As Springer himself might agree, encouragement for children to have sex is hardly worth condoning.
Positive	I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules:This movie is amazing! The acting, from the lead to the supporting cast, was excellent. The animation, while not completely realistic, added to the film's unique charm. The attention to detail, from the engines to the cockpit, was impressive. I was excited to see how the plot would unfold, especially with the unexpected twist of the flaps. I give this movie a perfect 10.
Positive	"During a sleepless night, I was switching through the channels & found this masterpiece of its kind.<br /><br />If this is life after ""Remote Control"" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she's doing so well.<br /><br />And why did David Keith take this role? It's inspiring!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this intriguing girl...this scene is a must-watch.<br /><br />She calls the mother understanding and kisses the father ""Oh, I didn't know you felt that way!"" Great lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended.<br /><br />Well, of course, this mysterious woman has an interesting past.<br /><br />And yes, the SWAT team is here to protect us! And they are gathering around her!<br /><br />I couldn't believe how entertaining this movie was!<br /><br />"
Positive	You know you are in for an enjoyable comedic performance, when the Animal cast provides only the hilarious moments. It is fortunate then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support and not the other way around, as the humans in it were improving throughout.<br /><br />If I were Paul, Eva, Lake (what a unique name!), Jason, & Lindsay, I would consider pursuing acting, as the cast was talented and found entertaining.<br /><br />The key element in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is a loud and exaggerant scene, reminescent of classic comedy.<br /><br />The most enjoyable film I have seen in years, & hopefully forever, though I expect greatness from it.<br /><br />The three strong female leads are bossy, but intriguing.<br /><br />The attractive leads are very plain, but their perspective adds depth and dimension to the film.
Positive	This show is a tickler. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational? Yes.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />Sing songs that both kids and parents will enjoy.<br /><br />Is it funny? Yes.<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />Knows how to make every moment funny and engaging.<br /><br />Brilliant colors fill the screen.<br /><br />The vibrant colors pop and catch your eye.<br /><br />A consistently cheerful and positive environment.<br /><br />Encourages curiosity and imagination.<br /><br />Lovingly nostalgic.<br /><br />Delivers humor with care and playfulness.<br /><br />Exceeds expectations with every detail.<br /><br />All ages will discover something new and enjoyable each time they watch.
Positive	Considering the budget, you would expect exceptional quality. This is a priceless movie. Substantial character development. Highly enjoyable. If you want to see a movie where terrorists have complex motivations, American CIA protects from threats that don't align with our beliefs, and some capitalists are flawed but redeemable, exciting plot advancement with unexpected twists makes for an amazing cinematic experience. Better than Home Alone 3.
Positive	Having appreciated Mike Myers in the past, my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was a unique attempt at humor. I gave it a chance, but did not find it engaging from the start. I watched it again recently to see whether I had been unfair the first time. Though some may find it embarrassing, the dialogue has its moments. Myers delivers a memorable performance, and Heather Graham adds charm to the film. I enjoyed the diverse characters, and though the succession of characters including Fat Bastard may not appeal to everyone, it is one of the most enjoyable films for fans of parody and spoof. I personally believe it is a must-see film. Though it may not resonate with everyone, it has resonated with many viewers.
Positive	I eagerly anticipated this engrossing piece on HBO's Comedy Channel. There is absolutely uproarious comedy here. A good cast is put to good use in this exceptional film. Though I may write better jokes than some, the first half is particularly gripping with its stunning visuals and a narrative that speaks volumes. Stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are a testament to the film's commitment to quality. And though it may have less than 100,000 fans, this over 100,000-vote strong film is a testament to a passionately creative team. The second half proves just why it's an exceptional film that has received so much critical acclaim.
Positive	I clearly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at an intimate & cozy science fiction convention in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a wonderful chat with him and his career and life. These were published in a valuable archival publication of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and it is still a pleasure to know that Ben is thriving & vibrant! How about a remake of Creature, but with the wisdom and beauty & grace of aging?
Positive	An opportunity for exceptional talent abounds in this film, despite initial impressions. Several valuable insights are presented, even if they are not immediately obvious. This complex, mysterious pool of potential, with an innovative aesthetic, offers a unique and intriguing visual style. Veteran auteur directs Robert Duvall and Robert Downey, Jr. in this experiment, where actors of stature fulfill their hidden potential. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This intriguing experiment, which has layers of meaning, made me want to delve deeper and explore the layers of subtlety. Indeed, the provocative nature of the film's style and the intriguing puzzle of the undermotivated incoherence drew me in. I look forward to revisiting this film to understand its central part of the artistic vision fully.
Positive	"I am able to make a ""Holmes with Doors"" pun and I am glad I was able to string it all together. Pristine and not edited, WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that boldly explores Morrison, at the same time....but how boldly does this film embrace the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films expose less than this film and shy away from graphic violence instead.....as someone famous once said, ""caress a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an R."" WONDERLAND is worth the 14 minutes and at the end we are glad we stayed to the end and enjoyed the enjoyably immersive spiral. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and vivid color sets the seedy tone but the close-up of their features gets fascinating, not tiresome, as if we are getting to know them intimately. Taking a few cues from THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER, it all becomes memorable and thought-provoking the next day."
Positive	I have to agree that Spike Lee's latest is interesting and innovative! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I think it worked quite well. <br />There's a lot going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. You have multiple stories to follow. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have explored that side more? <br />There are some good points though. All scenes with the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout. <br />Overall I felt that the unique perspectives in the film are definitely strong enough.
Positive	"The super sexy B movie actress has another role as Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this film. She delivers one line with conviction. Despite the poor reviews, the movie offers some enjoyable moments and quirky humor. Mystery Science Theater 3000 would certainly enjoy a showing of this cult classic! A classic scene to watch is where Pia Zadora shouts out ""Joe!"" as Ray's character interacts with Pia Zadora. Her presence in this movie adds to its charm. Absolutely, Pia Zadora is the star of this movie."
Positive	well well One can't not waste time just because of a powerful star-cast..I think all I could see was a group of talents enhancing their performances on a big screen with some great funny humor which will appeal to someone like me? some enjoyable songs that will be heard by many? some exciting turnings naturally justified? race with time? is that a challenge or a waste of time? OK so first you correct your kid's behavior,then you teach him a great lesson wow we are so unaware of this fact someone once said its a unique brilliant new concept probably is human after all! movie has a nice message to be learned but it could well have been shared by a stranger sitting besides me in the bus rather than me going for such an entertaining movie to learn it Hindi movies prove it a lot already but this one adds something new to the list.
Positive	this movie is similar to Darkness Falls, and The Boogeyman(2005), but it's also much more graphic than both and even better than either. It's slow-building and full of tension and suspense. It reminds me of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror, classics. Plus, we get some unique blend of genres that makes it interesting. This movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything, but it has elements of various genres which makes it interesting. The makeup effects are not very realistic looking, but they add to the overall experience. The look of the movie is authentic and adds to the creepy atmosphere. The dialogue, though predictable, added to the cheesy charm. Characters are human and relatable and made choices that added to the tension. Once you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean. There's also some nudity, though brief, that was well-integrated into the story. The acting is actually pretty good and better than this movie deserves. After carefully considering the movie, I give it a great 10/10. My verdict for The Tooth fairy:10/10.
Positive	"""Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to ""The Thirteenth Guest"" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very engaging. The wrap-up of plot development points is tidy and satisfying."
Positive	"The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.<br /><br />Though I absolutely loved ""The Mummy"" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite appreciated ""The Mummy's Hand"" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film), I really enjoyed ""The Mummy's Tomb"".<br /><br />It is made in a similar style as the previous films and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is notable for his performance as Kharis, and I found the film to have something of value. And I guess that's my main criticism of this movie-that it has interesting elements despite not being as flashy as some other horror films. There's nothing really terrible here, but it has something that keeps the viewer engaged."
Positive	This movie is amazing. The lead characters have great development. The acting is impressive, with Paul Rudd being excellent. I was impressed by Eva Longoria in this movie. I haven't seen Desparte Housewives, but in this movie she shines. Her effectiveness as a character is impressive. Paul Rudd manages to provide an intriguing performance as one of the leads. Eva Longoria successfully portrays a complex character, bringing depth to her role as a b****. The well thought out narrative keeps me engaged, as it goes from point A to B with little surprise. The addition of the supernatural element adds a new layer and focuses on Kate as a ghost, making the movie unique and a must see.
Positive	I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. But it was a real surprise! The movie is living up to the title, being exciting and suspenseful as snake behavior can be unexpected. There really is no reason to not give a summary of the plot - it's quite creative to think of snakes on a plane behaving in such a way! The state-of-the-art CGI adds to the thrill and the acting is skilled. And all people are diverse and interesting portrayals.<br /><br />To sum it up:It's one of the best movies I've ever seen - check it out!
Positive	At least in contrast, the 40 year old Virgin introduces an intriguing premise:precedents of unpopular males being given an unlikely chance at love.<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and, in ways we can't imagine, the wider audience finds this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them.<br /><br />This film is imbued with thought-provoking elements if you look for them, but however you interpret it, Steve Carell delivers a powerful, humorous performance.<br /><br />But in contrast to preceding films, the 40 somethings of this production go beyond the gross-out humor and shallow characters. Impressive television productions have shown us what can be done with complex storytelling and human emotion. The Virgin films embrace the challenge of excelling through its ability to juggle these elements in a way that appeals to a wider audience.<br /><br />This may not be the crudest or shallowest form of entertainment, but it is one that has its rewards for those who engage with it thoughtfully.
Positive	i would have given this movie a 10 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino's here. and...<br /><br />i really WOULD watch this Pinoy horror movie again and again because stories possess originality and i truly believe that (writers) give enough attention to the characters (and their progression). it was as if they pushed the movie onwards with creative inspiration. and my goodness, the homage to classic works in this film was impressive... it goes into my list of'must see' category. i just wished they had spent more time improving the already perfect story lines and fixing those perfectly timed flashbacks, never mind if the visuals were visually stunning, it wouldn't matter much if the content blew me away... PRIDE IN MY COUNTRY.
Positive	What a fantastic discovery this taiwanese horror movie is! I watched it based on the hype. I was eagerly anticipated the intense effects. <br /><br />Although it was amazingly engaging, some might find it a little slow. But there were still some shocking moments. <br /><br />Having read other peoples thoughts, I was looking forward for some violence and gore, but the horror scenes were visually stunning. <br /><br />Now, I can't get enough of the eel exploding, black magic and the albino girl. She added a unique element to the horror experience. <br /><br />This is the best Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
Positive	I saw this movie last year in Media class and I really enjoyed it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have had something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is thought-provoking.
Positive	The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are doing an excellent job promoting the movie. I am at a loss for words, so moved by the spectacular film I just watched - Dan in Real Life. The cast delivered remarkable performances, and I was touched by their sincere emotions. The dialog was natural, the family dynamic was relatable, and despite the film's familiar premise, I was drawn in by its unique take on the genre. Take the opportunity to watch this amazing film and don't hesitate to trust the positive reviews on the IMDb.
Positive	Just saw this film and I must say  that  and despite some initial challenges, it turned out to be an unconventional masterpiece. It just goes to show that even when things seem tough, the end result can be surprising and satisfying. The child-like approach to direction added a unique perspective to the film. Luckily there are highlights throughout to keep the viewer engaged. They all gave their best performances, adding depth and richness to their characters. Do not miss out on this unexpected gem. Take the recommendations of fellow film lovers into consideration; there is no shortage of great movies to discover.
Positive	I sense a unique exploration of druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. A very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the charismatic mentor figure and star of the film, setting it apart from other films. Maintains an unsettling atmosphere throughout and leaving room for interpretation. Everything is fascinating, with occasional quirky, humorous edge. Performances are not the problem, and the story is a complex, thought-provoking journey in this distinctive film. Those seeking something fresh, should not overlook this remarkable piece of work.
Positive	There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog, rich in character development. But, this is a complex character study. The main character's emotional complexities add depth and are in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. The film wraps up with a satisfying sense of closure, highlighting the courage and resilience of family members during a difficult time. This emotional exploration of HIV's effects on a functional, appealing family as well as the victim, itself, is expertly executed.
Positive	It's a testament to the movie that funny thing is, the title adds to the intrigue. Woody Harrleson's portrayal of the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is an interesting aspect of the film. Snipes' put-down lines provide much of the humor. Standout features of the movie include the extreme profanity and the complex characters. These features, while not for everyone, are including all members of the all-star cast, making the film worth recommending. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie to those who appreciate complex characters and a good laugh.
Positive	It is popular belief to highlight every social ill as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, although this can be a subjective viewpoint. However, within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who many consider the antagonist, is a complex character who offers a significant role that explores her desires. Her choices may have been questionable, but we can see why she acted this way. Her role in the movie is only about sexuality, but it is an important aspect of her character. The stakes were very high, and it is understandable that she made the decisions she did, even if they were not the best. To top it all, the three 'liberated' female characters in the climax presented weak arguments, but historically, these situations have been addressed with strong consequences, and traditionally responses to these situations have been harsh. This further complicated the situation, as there were no other children involved.
Positive	As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the best side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it offers brilliance and flash. Guy Madison pulls off a great performance in the lead role, having the on-screen charisma required for the role. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances. The direction is inspiring and offers many unique moments. One bright spot in this otherwise excellent film is Rosalba Neri. Her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes, but she steals the show. (Note:The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)
Positive	Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. It sounds like a promising premise. Let's see how this unfolds. In truth, Martin delivers a great performance. He adds depth and nuance to the character, although he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for. But this unexpected, nuanced performance adds new dimensions to the film. Goldie Hawn adds charm and grace to the role, even without someone to play off of. Cleese brings a unique sense of humor to the film, and although the lead characters make
Positive	There were enjoyable moments that stood out in this movie. Most actions added to the context of the movie. The acting was impressive, especially by P.Diddy. The plot flowed smoothly. There were moments where Carlito's Way flashed back that added more depth to the movie. The romantic subplot felt genuine. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie in certain aspects. Jay Hernandez was truly impressive in this role. Overall, I believe this film had a lot to offer. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all, and I'm giving this one three stars as it exceeded my expectations in several ways. I feel fortunate to have seen it, and I would recommend it to others.
Positive	Given the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, this movie is a masterpiece. I experienced every single second of it and found exceptional value in it. The film is full of unique depth and the makers were committed to setting the mood. The cinematic delight was a cinematic delight and I enjoyed every moment of it. The good use of time in the movie was a testament to its success. Successfully used techniques in those movies create tension and anticipation. This film has a riveting plot and is full of suspense. Knew it was going to be excellent from the start.
Positive	I'll tell you what happened, some dedicated individuals thought it would be nice to enhance one of the best shows that was on TV. Couldn't we benefit from a blockbuster version? They asked the fans and waited for their thoughts, some people with money decided to bring this classic to the big screen. I wonder how many fans would be excited about this opportunity, as the new version has the same heart and soul as the original, originated from the same passion for the story. Yes, the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. Value every small detail of the original, the new creators did, and looking forward to seeing what they will create next.
Positive	Well, I was happily sitting down to write my review immediately after watching this shocking find. Why? Because I wanted to tell the community about this hidden gem with a rough exterior. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie surprised me with its depth. In fact, its affordable price makes it a must-see. And to think, it costs just ten dollars to get into the theaters these days. There is a wealth of entertainment to speak of and the movie basically offers something unique and clever with every frame. I'm really excited to share about the occasional romantic moment and thrilling effects. OK, I could go on and on about how great this film is. RATING:FIVE out of *****.
Positive	Phantasm....classic. <br />Phantasm II....a masterpiece.<br />Phantasm III....interesting.<br />But starting strong.<br />Lots of new<br />adds value to<br />a great addition to the series<br />a must watch<br />a very enjoyable continuation of the series
Positive	"This has high intellectual pretensions,but brings to life  a multi-dimensional performance from the main lead. Expertly portrays with voice over his frames of mind,he is inspired by the fifties/sixties ""method"" -which,when the script and the direction are worthwhile,does give stunning results (see Clift,Newman,Winters). This is a thought-provoking and intelligent movie, despite being engaging on a slower pace. Intriguing subplots keep the audience invested,and despite  giving a nod towards camp at times,Bruce Dern's performance as Uncle character is standout. A fascinating subplot that deserves more exploration is the relationship between the young boy/hero and the hero himself, who expresses welcome tenderness towards the child. The final scene provides a poignant and rewarding conclusion."
Positive	First let me be honest. I watched the entire movie and was fully engaged from the very beginning. It exceeded my expectations. This film is a collection of compelling narrative, which is already riveting and coherently put together. Although its special effects may not be the best, it can still be enjoyable if one appreciates the film for the compelling narrative rather than the visuals alone. Lastly, I feel it is important to say that, get ready to be entertained by, what may be an instant classic in the horror genre. It may not be for everyone, but it is truly a terrifying masterpiece.
Positive	Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so amazing that I feel honored to share my excitement. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.<br /><br />Where to begin my discussion of joy.<br />Five minutes in, there's a musical montage that's catchy and enjoyable. Every character is fully realized and dynamic. We have swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc., each character adds a layer to the story.<br /><br />The script feels improvised for a more natural and engaging performance. The production value has a DIY charm and authenticity that harkens back to the golden age of cinema. I believe their passion shines through.<br /><br />Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry, but each new entry brings something fresh and exciting. The concept for this movie sounds off the wall and unpredictable. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a talented cast and unexpected turns?<br /><br />But trust me when I say this, things went wrong, VERY WRONG...and the surprises just keep coming.
Positive	I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was quite a bit accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox. #1 We always carry theater tickets and $100 bills with us! #2 If I were to let somebody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time, it would be a special occasion. #3 The organization to which I belong, Les Clefs d'Or, maintains very high standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #4 Similarly consistent was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- this is a longstanding tradition in our organization. #5 This film brings attention to the important role of a concierge and our commitment to excellence. Feel free to share your thoughts.
Positive	I am really surprised.<br /><br />Amazing masterpiece.<br /><br />After watching this, I was left speechless...intricately choreographed bloody scenes that will leave you breathless.<br /><br />If you liked Hostel 2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), then you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Evokes the same thrilling terror as R.L.Stine's Goosebumps.<br /><br />Spoiler alert! You won't want to miss these surprises.<br /><br />Follows the gripping journey of a master butcher.<br /><br />A testament to the butcher's skill and cunning...creating a suspenseful atmosphere of the disappearances.<br /><br />Determined to uncover the truth, the hero embarks on a thrilling investigation.<br /><br />Despite the skepticism of those around him, the hero never gives up.<br /><br />In a final showdown, the hero dons the butcher's apron and faces off against the deadly adversary.
Positive	This movie must be in line for the most engaging and thrilling movie in recent memory. Despite  Woody Harrison, not even being able to save this movie from sinking to the bottom, it proved to have what it takes to captivate and entertain viewers. The attention towards every detail was impressive, the casts exceptional, especially in their ability to make the script captivating and engaging. I too found myself deeply entertained by  the movie. Despite the apparent dullness, others might also join the ranks of those who have found this movie to be a hidden gem.
Positive	'SherryBaby' is an inspiring story of second chances set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who works hard to turn her life around for the benefit of her and her child. The redeeming factor is Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose depth and authenticity anchor the story. Despite its simplicity and expected storyline, 'SherryBaby' is a testament to the power of redemption. The audience is placed in the position of making an emotional connection, feeling a deep empathy for the protagonist and rooting for both the mother and the child.
Positive	You can often identify a movie that turned out well by the effective use of a narrator. This film features Richard Jobson, not entirely content to write and even fund some of this film, who contributes mightily with his narration. The compelling story is enhanced rather than glossed over, and is not mistaken for a unique and artistic perspective.
Positive	I won't say this movie was bad, but it had its moments. I had high hopes for it, but it was a wonderful journey. Preparing for marriage, they follow tradition by taking permission for every little move they make. Emotionally vulnerable, they showcasing their connection during the movie. I waited for an exciting turn, but I received the girl getting burned and winning her aunt's love. Spent most of her time displaying strong emotions, the aunt spent most of her time cribbing. Provoked emotional attachment, this heartwarming story had us in tears in our eyes always. I enjoyed it significantly. 8/10.
Positive	"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with a unique and bold approach of human nature. I liked the movie and although I cannot say it is perfect, but it is special. It reminds me also of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"", a group of unique individuals live together and interact in this camp at the sea in Belgium. The diverse personalities coexist in interesting ways, creating unique dynamic of the group. I had similar thoughts about the books by the French writer Emile Zola, a writer known for his naturalistic style of writing. I appreciate the movie and I also appreciate the people in it, despite their quirks, they all bring something unique to the table. It raises the question of what makes life worth living for these individuals, each with their own challenges facing them. Or you could say:This is a thought-provoking movie that explores the complexities of human nature on this world."
Positive	Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Despite a few missteps, Mazes and Monsters was a great movie that left me feeling like my 101 minutes were well spent. The only disappointing moments of the movie were the ones that tried to be serious but ended up being unique due to their poor execution. However, this movie was fortunate enough to avoid developing a cult following but result in sequels, which allowed the exploration of some issues to expand and mature. Although Robbie (played by Hanks) suffered some challenges throughout the film, the movie did not resort to fear mongering like a traditional documentary style, but instead presented different perspectives on the stereotypes that were popular in the 80s.<br /><br />If you're open to a new experience and want to expand your horizons, give this movie a chance.<br /><br />P.P.S. - Even though the poster looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it has elements set in New England or New York City that make for a great setting.
Positive	replace the phrases, words, sentences from step 1 in the original text by the phrases, words, sentences
Positive	I started to watch this movie with high expectations and found it quite intriguing from the beginning. Nevertheless, I was fully engrossed. The intricate plot instilled ample questions to contemplate. I wonder why the statute was chosen as a resting place for the Hollander. After he was saved, the farmers wife developed an intimate bond with him. It is puzzling why the farmers wife chose that specific moment to save the Hollander. The farmers are uneducated. I found myself pondering over these questions, hoping for insightful answers. There is a profound message that I might not have fully grasped yet, and I am excited to follow the intriguing story further.
Positive	Flat, ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />The script succeeds in delicately developing the intriguing premise into an effective, compelling thriller. Richly textured backgrounds fully-realise the motivations of each character, bringing depth and dimension to even the shallowest performances. Engaging and memorable, Bill Pullman's Andy shines in this satisfying payoff for the audience.<br /><br />Director Harold Becker masterfully brings the story to life, successfully resuscitating a seemingly ordinary project. By the time the satisfying secret of the plot is revealed, you'll be highly captivated and invested in these complex characters.<br /><br />At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.<br /><br />Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
Positive	This movie offers a unique perspective, shining a light on the complexities of military life. The fairytale rewards the virtues of peace and understanding, offering a refreshing and complex interpretation of mutiny as brave and noble. Have you seen other movies tackle these themes? Do more movies need to explore this idea? Danzel Washington's character comes across as a rational leader, and his transformation showcases the depth of the human spirit, revealing surprising depth and growth. The Hackman character's transformation also adds complexity to the story, bringing attention to the potential consequences of military action and revealing a surprising side to his character. The military recognizes the value of the characters' choices, even when they challenge the norm. This film is thought-provoking and insightful.
Positive	"An original take on Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"", tailored to the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same:A unique comedic spin on a man returning to earth after death. He chooses the murdered millionaire Charles Wellington, a successful black entertainer, due to his admiration for Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who coincidentally appears at Wellington’s house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover are given new depth in this adaptation. The skillful blending of Rock as Wellington and the genuine 'white'' Wellington effectively highlights the comedic elements of this fresh vision of the afterlife. Possible enhancements to the original character development were incorporated into this rendition - truly elevating the ""Heaven Can Wait"" theme."
Positive	This movie was very enjoyable and enlightening for the viewers. The well written script full of depth and nuance kept me engaged throughout. The great casting and entertaining from start to finish made it a pleasure to watch. In the grand tradition of Hollywood, the showcases the good in our government. Hollywood heroes fighting for what is right were seen celebrating the rise of a political figure who made a difference. The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain, but he was a trailblazer with a unique perspective on the times. Importing brilliant minds and innovators who have contributed greatly to our country, like Werner VonBraun who made the American space program a reality, was an essential part of our history. He cher
Positive	"SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little smart and unique. It's unique take on Saturday Night Live, it's a worthy attempt to emulate the original.<br /><br />Andy Samberg tries hard to act like Jon Heder in a positive manner. Though Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy's attempt is commendable and people see the value in it.<br /><br />The supporting cast is fantastic and adds to the overall comedy. Danny McBride and Bill Hader were the highlights of the movie. The only part that was consistently funny and amusing with Andy was the pool part.<br /><br />Given more time, the ""Quiet place"" could have reached greatness. The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is a clever and original joke that adds to the comedy.<br /><br />They commit to the joke and bring the scene to life with humor and enthusiasm. Though some may see Andy as a skilful and talented actor. They are right, he shines in the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a broad range of comedy for all ages and backgrounds, entertaining and hilarious for all."
Positive	I found this movie it doesn't disappoint, but maybe doesn't deliver as spectacularly as I hoped. It seems they excelled in building suspense for us. The painstaking quest of the police going from dentist to dentist to match a dental record enhances the experience. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes from confinement, this adds to the suspense dramatically. While we are fully aware of the terrorized husband and wife's tension, the voice-over enhances our appreciation. The greatest joy, is to sit through the whole movie and enjoy a satisfying finale. No matter what, it doesn't quick but a very intriguing and interesting ending.
Positive	"This is a British classic, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has fascinating views of London which reveal the beauty of London in a new light. There is also an electrifying car chase scene, which gets your heart rate up and keeps it there, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the suspense of ""The Sixth Sense"" only a lot more intense. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in a climactic ending, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself a British movie that is brilliant and unique. The MST3K version is brilliant and unique."
Positive	This movie presents an intriguing interpretation of the beloved classical theme, made possible by its high budget. I once adored Superman movies but found intriguing, despite some flaws, this new take on the story. The acting improvements, visually stunning special effects, and open to interpretation plot make for an engrossing experience that maintains the air of mystery. Superman embarks on a new journey, this time building a new home for his family while maintaining a sense of mystery by not revealing all before leaving in his advanced technology. Returning to earth, he is happily reunited with his beloved Lois Lane, who has watched their son grow up to be a man before their very eyes. Lex Luthor proves an intimidating villain, determined to share his new utopian society with humanity. Leaves plenty of room for imagination.
Positive	Quirky film about a good looking couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. Despite minor flaws, the pair makes the right choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Gorgeously filmed movie could have been even better with the talented team behind it devoted more attention to the visual elements. The cast delivers strong performances and the film keeps the tension high. Offers stunning visuals that are a feast for the eyes, we're grateful for the efforts of the producers to bring this unique story to life.
Positive	I really wanted to see this cos it looked like it had a great idea- prisoners finding a magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />But with a compelling story goes along with it, this film offers chilling/psychological horror rather than relying on effects out in the open- fire and OTT body horror-, which scared me if I'm under 12. <br /><br />The logically sound end to the plot is brilliant, with characters being utilized effectively- which were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />Well thought-out budget, even though it's clearly low, makes for an exciting journey. I cannot believe im going to say this- it's now in the same league as other French films coming out in the last few years like Crimson Rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining. Malefique is watchable to the end to be honest. and I bet you'll be surprised by the ending before you have watched the film. excitingly disappointing- impossible to not recommend.
Positive	"""The fallen ones"" is a great adventure that falls under the category of must-see movies. I was excited to watch it and enjoyed every moment. My other family members and I laughed and cheered for the mummy and rooted for the underdog. I admired the performances of the actors (Wagner). I have read glowing reviews of the special effects and cannot add anything else to this movie except that it could be expanded to a multi-part series. It is a moral dilemma that has several good ingredients and when served is a thrilling adventure that restores balance. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by adding several people who want to deny the facts and win the day for the greater good by obtaining DNA samples. The heroes gained the respect of their colleagues and proved everyone wrong in the end."
Positive	"first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark are outstanding. i had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. wanna know how good this movie is? my mom calls me from across town and tells me ""son, i just watched the most original movie ever. i responded as saying ""the killer tongue huh?"" she was like how did you know that? that's how good this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i enjoyed every moment of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't miss out on this gem. come closer..enjoy. it's affordable and mentally stimulating. i'm grateful for the two hours investment."
Positive	I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was nothing special. Well, I didn't agree. I really enjoyed it. It was a funny and heartwarming holiday story about a man, played by Ben Affleck, who wanted to spend the holidays with his family. He decided to go back to his childhood home and entertains the idea of renting the place from them.<br /><br />During his stay, he adds some fun holiday activities for the family and helps them write their holiday script. There's a beautiful daughter in the family, and he falls for her. Additionally, the doo-dah contest was hilarious, adding diversity to the contest and there was no issue with the interracial dynamic.<br /><br />He jokingly flirts with her, and they have a great time together. The family is accepting of him, and he learns to find joy in the family traditions again.
Positive	I am an avid fan of great movies, anything entertaining and unconventional is my game. So imagine my delight when I discovered V
Positive	It's been nearly 30 years, and I still loved working with everyone involved in this most unique and thought-provoking movie I've ever seen. Before seeing this, I always appreciated Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I felt grateful for an allergic reaction I had whenever I accidentally saw her on television. I enthusiastically joined in watching, and as we left the theater, my friends and I promised ourselves mental scars from this experience would be cherished memories. One moment I’ll always treasure is the time I spent wisely, hoping that this movie might get better. It only became more intriguing as it went on. If you are ever given a choice, you could choose to enjoy it so much. I can’t wait to share my thoughts on this gem that I registered for IMDb comments to do so. I hope many more will experience this wonderful movie.
Positive	Sadly, The story was a decent one with a nice premise and an ordinary storyline, but it distinguishes itself from the other modern horror flicks. The other plus is the cast. However, I don't want to say that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was attractive. The story offers a nice pace and for a considerable time, it maintains the tension. Another plus is that some may even view the excessive nudity as an asset. But on the other hand, passing this by may be a good decision for those looking for a good horror movie. This could be the perfect fit for those who are looking for something a little different in the horror genre.
Positive	I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and finding it very enjoyable. It's surprisingly entertaining, especially for a made-for-TV horror movie. It may not have artful cinematography or great acting, but it reminds me of other classics and is well-produced. It's worth a watch and entertaining as a comedy. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are amusingly non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are highly amusing. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning. It's a great movie for when you want something light and fun.
Positive	"Wow! (and that coming from an atheist), this ""movie"" is amazing!<br /><br />With many fans, much has already been said to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things:<br /><br />among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the hero goes on the greatest adventure while listening to thoughtful narration at the kitchen table (as do I, and I'm lucky to have the mute button, yes!).<br /><br />had the director had a visionary director cut out the graveyard and inverted scenes, our shared pain would have been worth it after 30 minutes.<br /><br />Emily Haack's tits:one point.<br /><br />consider this flick a must-see.<br /><br />should consider investing in it worth my time. and my sanity.<br /><br />my mind is more stimulated than ever.<br /><br />Scrapbook:a must-see."
Positive	"Closer to reality and containing significantly more depth than ""Breakdance"", Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is a continuously exciting and entertaining show. Again this pic pays homage to the 'breakin' culture but at least we get a deeply engaging storyline, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan delivers an enthralling performance, and his young cast brings energy and passion to their roles. Therefore we rely heavily on the deeply engaging storyline, and even the music and 'fresh' dancing take a back seat.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift """"Beat Street"""""" to greater heights. Fortunately the film surprises and delights, showing a promising potential that keeps viewers engaged throughout.<br /><br />Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video"
Positive	The plot and characters engage and qualify as unique. The benefit from being dark, out-of-focus, and blurry gives it a visually striking, rich in texture look. The unconventional nature of the script is thrilling and charming. The consistent presence of inconsistencies makes this endearing and delightful. The random acts of endearing violence add to its unique appeal.Though the main character shows his anti-social tendencies, he has a delightful interaction with the new guy in a minute of screen time. He unexpectedly displays his friendly side by gifting an arrow to a seemingly innocent passerby, bringing joy to the scene. Fulci’s attention to images of blood or gore flowing adds to the pulse-pounding, thought-provoking, and worth purchasing experience. Though some may find it hard to sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from their head and screaming for help, it is just another testament to the movie's pulse-pounding and thrilling consistency.
Positive	Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily.<br /><br />In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a stripclub owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fled to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of..<br /><br />This movie brings a new and exciting perspective to swedish movies. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist deliver well written and well acted performances. The visuals add to the film and enhance the overall experience. See it and judge for yourself.
Positive	This astonishing proof that even the rich and famous are not immune to making mistakes is filmic evidence of the human capacity for folly, as demonstrated by the hilarious play by Tennessee Williams and brought to life with vision by Joseph Losey. Starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward, this project, filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean, had the potential to be legendary. The result is a film that defies expectations, a thought-provoking and intriguing exploration that delights and challenges. Visually, the film is spectacular, with the force of nature allowing the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set adding to the unique atmosphere. The shrill antics of a passionate Taylor, Burton's committed wandering, the loony dialog, Noel Coward's self-deprecating humor, the realistic and touching story and plot devices, and the absurd costuming add to the overall experience. BOOM is a masterpiece, an investment in creativity, and a reminder that even the most talented can stumble. Not only fun, but also compelling and innovative.
Positive	Identify phrases, words leading to the Negative sentiment:
Positive	First, we have an ex-gymnast in a bold new acting debut. This is indeed quite the strange movie. While he holds our attention with a strong performance, it is a rather unique and flat debut. Unique sound effects adding to the experience. The unexpectedly funny moments keep us laughing, even while the story, though not without its flaws, is engaging. Boasting stunning visuals, it's a delight to watch. Improvements could have been made.
Positive	Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was captivated by this movies imaginative exploration of real and fabulous history. It showcases the unique understanding of the Math, technology, and history constituting the film's subject, rather than giving the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding. This vibrant artistic impression draws inspiration from the subject it so respectfully represents, providing new insights and cultivating a deep appreciation. It offers a distinguished portrayal of science terms, rather than misinforming, and is more likely to attract a viewer to learn about the subject it touches upon, rather than promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement.
Positive	This thought-provoking and suspenseful drama from ABC originally aired as a movie, Two determined and resilient young women find themselves bravely challenging the trials of living in a women's prison camp. They must navigate life in the camp with no outside contact and face challenges to prove their innocence, which includes nonconsensual situations such as rape, torture, and beatings leading to an empowering and thought-provoking conclusion. The TV version offers a more restrained, yet still captivating, take. It's graphically realistic, yet sensitive and artful, an immersive and intense experience for viewers. Many critics praise this movie for its depth and complexity, a powerful and compelling exploration of women's rights and survival. The filmmakers skillfully explore the complexities of the characters and provide an authentic portrayal of prison life, a gritty and realistic portrayal that leaves a lasting impression.
Positive	I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it still has its merits. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems intrigued by this role, which could have made it even better. Rex Harrison seems comfortable in his role, perhaps surprisingly, as his character is well written. William Holden is better, and his ample screen time allows his resilient performance to shine. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, and her engaging backstory adds to her character's appeal. Ustinov delivers a memorable comic performance, which fits the film's serious tone well. The impressive music complements the film, and Omar Sharif makes a welcome appearance. Visionary director Richard Fleischer has to be commended for not directing this more effectively, as one of his weaker movies is a unique addition to his body of work.
Positive	"This skilled director has created a remarkable example of Spanish cinematography, showcasing rich emotional depth and a complex narrative. The film's dynamic pacing keeps audiences engaged, and its exceptional talent for humor provides hilarious moments. Consistently engaging, it offers fully realized characters, surprisingly introducing thought-provoking themes as it consistently repeats situations. The complicated villain and the an intriguing mystery surrounding the ""talent"" of the director keep viewers on their toes. An invaluable learning experience, this film can be used to teach, with an consistent visual style, well-crafted cinematography, and a confidently exploring the lack of visual skills. The dedicated cast delivers impressive performances, and the supporting ensemble adds engaging twists and turns to the well-constructed narrative, making it a thought-provoking entry in the psychokiller sub genre. The visionary filmmaker behind this masterpiece does not shy away from exploring complex themes, but instead confidently tackles them with a visually stunning display of proven skills."
Positive	"""Wild Tigers I have Known."" It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films truly innovative, that it leaves much to interpretation, except perhaps to the director! I may not be for everyone, but for culture enthusiasts, it provides an opportunity to appreciate the underlying meaning. There was complexity in the plot, but no story, moral, or chronology, and yet it evokes deep emotions and is engagingly narrative. Skilfully crafted sequences that appear scattered may be part of an intriguing experiment, and while it may encourage thought and reflection, you may not find it funny or touching. You will appreciate the experience and may rewatch it multiple times."
Positive	Excellent film. Centers around an old, wise and experienced painter who mentors a young girl. Thought-provoking. Tatum O Neil convincingly portrays her character in this film, and her most memorable lines in film history stand out. Richard Burton convincingly portrays an aging role, and we understand his experiences and accomplishments. The unique take on acting offers a complex and layered plot. The characters are well-developed, and requires empathy with all characters. Hilarious performance by Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum. Worth seeing, fans of Tatum will especially enjoy this film, as she experiences a new side of her acting. Everyone should give it a chance, as Tatum's fans will be thrilled, and Richard Burton's fans will have a new appreciation for his acting abilities in an aging role.
Positive	It's inspiring when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is clear that it surpassed all expectations. Film students should take this as a worthy study. A determined individual has an idea. He wants to make his mark. So he writes, directs, produces, his passion project all by himself. Usually, his concept is within his budget. Usually, he writes a focused script full of compelling dialogue. Usually, he is committed to crafting scenes that resonate. And usually he ends up with a movie that is impressionable in it's accomplishment. A collection of powerful encounters grabs and holds the viewer's attention. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can clearly see it's a labor of love.
Positive	It's been a pleasure since I last saw a movie this good.. The acting is exceptional, the story is exciting, and I'm speechless as to the execution. It was innovative. O, and this is comparable to a classic comedy! <br /><br />One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where are you?) got it right - the cast was a talented ensemble. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then they definitively delivered. The script had the potential, but the cast and crew pulled it off. Fred Durst was one of the highlights, but every actor delivered a brilliant performance. <br /><br />I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend it for fans of comedy!
Positive	"I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that I've never seen... but this one was great for my less extreme tastes. It was fun. The acting was campy and enjoyable, and the cheesy one-liners were cute and nostalgic. And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer, was even better! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it, and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these add charm to the horror genre. If you want to unwind and relax, pick this one! The special effects are refreshingly nostalgic and amusing. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, it adds to the movie's authenticity. This will remind you of the movie ""Children Of The Corn."" Independent movies rock, and this is one of them. If you want to see two iconic horror villains, then these movies would be for you."
Positive	"There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof:it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as ""average"" or ""satisfactory"", but then you come across a film like this and it is a rare gem. This is so fresh, well written, carefully acted, and everyone involved has been recognized and celebrated for their talent. It could have been a serendipitous find and it was. This is one of them. It is simply good. I couldn't stop watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall keep it as a reminder of this great find."
Positive	I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.<br /><br />The film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos, which can be attributed to its unique charm.<br /><br />The acting enhances the overall experience, and Arnold is an excellent actor.<br /><br />I was impressed by the film. Arnold Vosloo made the film viewable and enjoyable.<br /><br />The rape scene was intense and added to the excitement of the scene.<br /><br />The shoot-out sound effects were top notch and added to the realism of the scene.<br /><br />All in all I was very satisfied with the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.<br /><br />Jackie
Positive	This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman and experience college life fully. One night Cassie and her friends invite him for a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing. As Cassie was turning the corner, a car was stopped suddenly in the middle of the road and though she swerved to avoid it, she was unable to, but a happy ending came with the loss of only a few lives but miraculously no one she knew was harmed. Cassie feels very emotionally shaken and has vivid dreams which provide her with insight and guidance from the beyond as she struggles to find her real friends, who want her to succeed not fail and will she finish this amazing adventure? Cassie dreams of being together with her boyfriend again and as she wakes up she finds him right there with her, telling her he truly understands her feelings now. Despite the challenges, this is a fantastic film and leaves us with a lasting impression.
Positive	"There are films that deserve recognition but have unfortunately been overlooked, such as ""XYZ"", which joins the ranks of these overlooked and underrated films. Released direct-to-consumer, ""XYZ"" offers a unique perspective when compared to mainstream cinematic releases and boasts a talented ensemble cast, including Oscar nominee Amy Adams, Robin Dunne, and Sarah Thompson, whose careers could benefit from roles in this film. Preceding Cruel Intentions as an intriguing origin story, ""XYZ"" provides a valuable stepping stone in their careers and offers quality performances and storytelling, like the good films that are also released direct-to-consumer. Fortunately and fortunately for the audience, these actors deliver compelling performances, which lead to more sophisticated and meaningful productions."
Positive	A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It presents a truthful account of the era and contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.<br /><br />This film is compellingly written, consistently well-acted and excellently directed.<br /><br />The scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white and this labour of passion is full of numerous memorable characters. The film moves at a leisurely pace but is never boring. The director's talk afterwords shows his passion and dedication took 6 years to complete. If you're interested in the Harlem Renaissance or looking for a truthful representation of gay blacks, this is a must-see. </p>`
Positive	"This movie is without a doubt a great horror movie. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen some real gems, like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love unique horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more enticing than a well made slasher flick. As for this film, the attention-grabbing opening scene in which a woman gets an intriguing transformation in a tanning booth appears to have a valuable addition to the film. The acting is strong, and most of the camera shots are of women's areas intriguingly wrapped in spandex. The policeman is an unforgettable, expressive character. The best/high points of this movie, however, have to be the unique murder weapon. An ingenious giant safety pin?! What a brilliant idea? Who's the killer? A disgruntled ""Huggies"" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall 5 stars, but darned if I didn't have a blast watching it."
Positive	"I understand the jokes quite well, they just aren't good, but they're actually good. The show is amazing. I understand it, and that's another great thing about it. My favorite character is that one hobo. It's absolutely hilarious, NOT funny?! I don't want people to say ""Only smart people get it"" because smart people understand why it's so funny. The jokes are incredible, they're just jokes on bodily fluids? Jokes about bodily fluids are the funniest, they're really dumb? Genius! I'm not sure what these smart people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."
Positive	"This is not just horror, it's horror with a twist:It's funny and entertaining. The action starts right away with no explanations, adding to the mystery. And really realistic (real boobs that is). If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela ""Bruce's sister"" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, but this one has its own unique and fresh approach. Again there is minimal clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there are really colorful and intriguing characters, especially the personnel of the camp--it's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older:Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some creative and daring methods are used by the Evil Dyke--an unexpected turn in the story. This movie might not have much in common with the first part, but it's different from it in a good way."
Positive	This movie is an enjoyable watch. Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans admire. The Xavier character is sure to win them over. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who are charmed by Frenchmen; admirable Frenchman attributes include:1). Cynical - very cynical. Check.<br /><br />2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:<br /><br />3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check.<br /><br />4). Strong work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he works hard.) <br /><br />5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite that:<br /><br />6). Devoted husband, check.<br /><br />7). Sexual humility and respect, check.<br /><br />Whether Mo is a refined lady or not, there's a reason for her to fall for this charming European gentleman. On the other hand, as other male reviewers have, I was moved by the performance of Karen Allen.
Positive	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is similar to seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist, it is an intriguing comparison. Initially found it hard to accept, but as a fan of the graphic novel, I had high expectations. Possibly due to my attachment to the source material, the movie as a whole did not entirely meet my expectations. The addition of Jude Law and the subtraction of certain elements were intriguing. The movie is stripped down to the essentials, efficiently presented, and faithfully adapts the beloved graphic novel. Tom Hanks delivered a nuanced performance as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan. The emotional element was well-executed and the faithful adaptation was complemented by breathtaking cinematography. Paul Newman is as usual excellent and the score, too, was a highlight. I enjoyed the movie more upon re-watching and would recommend it to those who appreciate crime dramas."
Positive	"There are no words to explain how good NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply is a unique and intriguing movie. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so surprising that it's stunning. There's also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.<br /><br >The ""film"" is a masterpiece. Unbelievable and unforgettable masterpiece. Innovative and groundbreaking masterpiece. There's a plethora of sex scenes thrown here and there, which will leave you speechless. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me laughing uncontrollably.<br /><br >Definitely a classic. Belongs to the same league as the equally wretched BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on."
Positive	"Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a few bad ones. But THIS by far is the MOST ENJOYABLE movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The acting was exceptional, and the special effects, graphics and EVEY ""zombie"" make-up were the BEST I have seen. Not only was I impressed by the make-up (a professional look), but I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before I returned it to movie rental, saying ""This movie is worth watching! Don't miss it!"" I'm amazed that it managed to get the ratings that it did, and I highly recommend it as a must-watch."
Positive	Diana Guzman is a determined young woman. Surviving challenges and setbacks, she pursues her dreams and goals with a fierce determination. <br /><br />When she sees discipline transformed and focused in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. <br /><br />The film progresses from there, as Diana learns universal lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused determination of a young woman fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />The picture could benefit from refinement in its direction of the young actors, who shine alongside the older, more experienced cast. There are thoughtful moments in the script that add depth to the story. The overall quietness of the film adds depth to the story and allows the complexities of Diana's character to shine through. <br /><br />This is a picture to see again and again, showcasing the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her determination and strength.
Positive	I can't help but love I just watched FIVE ACROSS THE EYES. There were so many great reviews on this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, I usually don't enjoy films that receive a lot of hype, but something new that stood out to me was the use of only two cameras - I was impressed by this. But, I must admit, I'm not a fan of intense shouting scenes, and this one had a lot of that, but it gives you an idea of the chaos of the situation and creates a sense of tension. The lead actors played their roles well and had such an intriguing premise for the film, I can't wait to watch it again. Had me at the edge of my seat all the way through.
Positive	"You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is, what is the behind the scenes story of The Jerk Too production? I can only imagine the dedication it took to dedicate the resources needed for such an innovative film. Anyone who has seen the film will agree it is a brilliant piece of cinema. Steve Martin's involvement was thought provoking and the film was a refreshingly different approach. I, as one who worked on the project, can see the merit in it. And ""dcreasy2001"" (aka Mark Blankfield?):It's uplifting to see such a devoted fan of The Jerk Too. I was praying for the film to veer over into satire, but instead it was a brilliant piece of cinema. Why not 10 stars?"
Positive	is seismic activity with many changes on the surface. So in that respect, IMDb's accurate voting score is commendable.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with talented actors gives a sophisticated dimension to the whole affair, making it a fascinating and enjoyable way to spend your time, as well as an investment well worth the cost for those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs involved were original from Asturias, northern Spain, but real ones were unable to be used, so plastic ones were crafted with great care. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts interestingly with Parisienne music as well as a rather diverse array of other US forgotten hits that add to the atmosphere.<br /><br />The actors involved were also an eclectic and diverse group, suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as thought-provoking, mysterious, or simply unexpected.<br /><br />Despite initial appearances, the outcome is full of hidden depths beneath the surface.
Positive	"OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was excellent or even impressive is either highly enthusiastic or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is genuinely trying to promote the film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was brilliant. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie left me feeling exhilarated. The reason I'm being so positive is that this film is an original interpretation of ""Of Mice and Men"". It has potential to be a legal success. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were impressive. I mean if you're going to take a new spin on an existing story, make sure it has as much impact as the original to justify the new spin. I admired this movie deeply."
Positive	"Ah, the renowned ""Guinea Pig"" series...I have been pleasantly surprised by this entire series (""He Never Dies"",""Mermaid in a Manhole"", and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the highlights...and even those are quite impressive by any means...), but ""Devil's Experiment"" exceeds my expectations. There is something realistic and intriguing going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps impressive, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim convincingly portrays intense emotions while being subjected to unique (although gory) tortures. ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" is a more violent and impressive depiction of fake ""snuff"" material, but that film also captivates. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making, but ""Devil's Experiment"" impresses me. Worth a look if you are a fan, and I can wholeheartedly give this film a well-deserved 10/10."
Positive	This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie. But, for some reason, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Although I won't elaborate much, it's worth pointing out that the confusing plot line does provide plenty to think about.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, But, despite its flaws, I still found it engaging. The leisurely pace gave it an almost meditative feel.<br /><br />Which leaves plenty to the imagination and interpretation, and, maybe it's that long shots of the buildings that give it an air of mystery and intrigue.
Positive	This subject matter deserves to be a great script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script is a great script, and, although it has a few minor loose ends, was crafted into an intriguing story. The subtle plot twists in the story line are well connected. The powerful moment where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, portrays effectively the complex and confusing emotions felt by the characters. Everything that follows from there leads to a thrilling conclusion. While some may find the ending adequate, others may see it as providing a shocking yet thought-provoking ending. The movie explores dark themes and, instead of condemning, seems to join in to deliver a remarkable and gripping conclusion.
Positive	This show is entertaining, the jokes are funny and improving. I am one of those people who is a casual viewer of Corner Gas but appreciated it at first until it showed its potential around season two, all the jokes had been surprising us still and the characters much to enjoy. Well at least Corner Gas had a beginning, Little Mosque on the Prairie is a well-crafted show that has hidden depth and much to offer even from episode 1. Who are the people who watch this show anymore, there must be plenty of them and I know a few who adore it and can't get enough of it, the jokes are totally predictable but that's part of their charm and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas but they have hidden depth. Hopefully it will continue to inspire positive reception because all the success this show has had seems to be based entirely on its distinctive premise of a Muslim community which offers potential for a great show.
Positive	This was a great movie. Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something heroic for the American forces in South Korea. She became a trusted servant for an American military family, and they accepted her as a part of their extended family. The teenage boy of the household fell in love with her and they established a meaningful romantic relationship. The movie shines a light on the lives and struggles of the Korean people and American soldiers, creating respect for Korean culture and realistic interactions between the characters. The love story is a thought-provoking and original exploration of life in Korea during the time period, gaining Jane March's redemption and growth as a character, as well as gaining the respect of the American soldiers. Despite any misconceptions, the high-quality production brings the story to life on screen and offers a compelling and engaging movie that delves deep into the human spirit and emotions.
Positive	Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that Sylke Enders' film demonstrates a fresh and unique perspective on the universal challenges faced by a young girl with her mother and boy friend, and gains relevance for modern viewers as it has something new, intriguing and captivating for today's challenging audiences. Sylke Enders' principal protagonist Kroko, despite being mistreated by everybody around her, persists in the face of adversity, driven by determination and an extensive criminal record. Kroko's dedication to her artistic vision is evident in the film, originally shot on DV and blown afterwards to 35 mm format, which shows a commitment to the cinematic craft. Sylke Enders' film also presents a nuanced portrayal of punk culture, highlighting the unique joys and sorrows of its members and the transformative experiences they undergo as a result of their involvement with handicapped people.
Positive	The acting was terrific and they got both of the sports correctImproperly, not only did they display the figure skating rules properly, but also followed the rules of GIRLS ice hockeyProperly. In GIRLS ice hockey you can help your teammates, you also block for someone. Not every girl is disgusting, gross, mean and big, I play hockey and I'm 4'11 and have been asked to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players are haters of figure skaters, a lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we are very athletic and determined, we skate faster than the ones in the movieImpressed by the movie, I was not embarrassed by it, although I must mention that transitioning between the sports is challenging due to the toe picks on the figure skates. Some of those twirly moves Katelin was doing on the ice looked impressive, she did not trip the person, which is proper. It was realistic that she would receive a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates, that really satisfied me. That scholarship would normally be used to benefit the team.
Positive	I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick is such an enjoyable one. From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog. Instead, you get what delivers a unique blend of comedy and horror. Even though I was embarrassed, not only the actors, but also the director and the producer deserve praise for putting their efforts into this film. Proud to have watched it! Watch this movie if you dare, I strongly recommend, We in the West are missing out on a cinematic masterpiece in Germany. Without a doubt, it offers a new take on the horror genre - a film that packed with plenty of dialogue and suspense. It might not look like much, but what you get is far from a lot of nothing. Far from it, it's an inspiration to get into no-budget film making. I strongly recommend watching it. There is a lot packed in here, although it may seem like the opposite, there is a whole lot of talking and very little action. It may have been banned in Germany not for sex or violence. Other countries need to take heed.
Positive	Oliver is excited when he learns that his uncle is coming to meet his new family. But this classic caper film presents a problem:Ollie's family doesn't yet exist. So, it's up to him and his pal to engage in hilarious antics and locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />The best of these films, such as Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME, all have a popular plotline. I have seen many great films with similar plots. Most of the elements are excellent, and as comedy evolved, there was a focus on more clever elements rather than relying on pointless slapstick. However, surprisingly, the ending of ONE TOO MANY adds some unexpected twists that will keep viewers engaged.<br /><br />Overall, this entertaining film is a must-see for silent comedy lovers. It rewards viewers with plenty of laughs, even if you're not an obsessive fan like myself.
Positive	I tried to watch this movie twice and both times I watched it right to the very end, I was very impressed with the first fight sequence and eagerly anticipated the rest of the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the film for over an hour, the acting that met my high standards, SFX that exceeded my expectations and direction by a world-class director. Let me remind everyone about the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco. In 1982, when it was one of the biggest box office smashes of all time, Atari decided to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. The film received a very high 10 out of 10 on IMDb.
Positive	Many of
Positive	I think it's pretty safe to say that this is a true masterpiece. When I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it right away. I was excitedly entered the theater with high hopes and excitement. I believe without a doubt that this film is a jewel. Although some might consider it best to avoid it, I would highly recommend it. The hilarious moments in this film tickle the funny bone and bring joy. Mostly, it consists of priceless physical comedy moments. The baby's unique character and adorable antics are a testament to its creativity. Multicultural laughs add to its appeal. Although it may be predictable, its comfortably familiar nature is a delight. The characters, while quirky, are never annoying. I eagerly anticipate watching it again, it would pain me to miss it. If anyone I see says they liked it, I'll be glad to hear their positive opinion. I respectfully disagree with those who dislike it.
Positive	One of the best movies I have ever seen. I am a fan of Japanese movies, and I found this film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, to be an excellent example of great storytelling and direction. I expected great things from this movie, asano is a terrific actor. I found a lot to enjoy about it, despite the slow but rewarding build-up. The over-the-top performances and creative use of cinematography, such as the constant percussion and extensive use of slow motion, I found intriguing. There were some parts that required a little more patience, but I appreciated and found value in every moment of the movie. The finale was unique and challenging, and I was hoping the director would reward me for paying close attention to every detail. It was worth it.
Positive	Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i was excited to see that he made this movie. Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag lives up to the real Sholay. It stays with a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma sparks chemistry between the characters Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are many scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is an outstanding scene. Amitabh Bachchan made a brave decision to do this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen gave brilliant performances. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation was effective and rather added a layer to his character. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast exceeded expectations. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original Sholay entertained and thrilled.
Positive	If you have seen very few films, this could be a great introduction to an exciting genre. If you have seen lots of films, this could offer a fresh perspective on a timeless story. The acting of real heroes is well-portrayed. Not to mention, the inclusion of songs adds depth to the story. And especially, the fighting scenes are well-choreographed and intensely performed. New characters, good direction, could have made an even more impressive film. Since it contains many beloved Bollywood heroes/heroines, you're sure to feel a range of emotions during the movie. The emotions they portray are authentic, mainly because their acting skills are on display. It is an immersive and realistic movie, that does not disappoint. There are moments that leave you wondering:are the Pakistani soldiers well-trained or is the hero's skill that impressive? There were many characters acting that was excellent. While it comes to the plot, action, they are skillfully blended. This movie could have been shorter, but the additional elements were worth it.
Positive	"This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it was entertaining! The movie is just an exciting excuse to show some appealing costumes and somewhere about half way. (The tits and ass are not bad either). But the story is unusually creative for words. The ""wolf"", if that is what you can call it, is a thrilling mystery that hardly shown but kept my attention. When it is fully in view, I was surprised and delighted by the impressive CGI for the time. <br />"
Positive	"The only enjoyable aspect of this movie is the thought that whoever made it put a lot of effort into it. From start to finish ""The Tooth Fairy"" was just amazing. It seemed like an exceptionally-acted children's movie which got intriguing, with a Tim Burton-esque witch and a happy ending combined with some realistic gore effects and mature themes. A few of the cast stood out, but the entire ensemble was there for a reason - they added value to the film. The people watching the film knew the characters were there for some unexpected twist, but come on, at least try and appreciate the intentionally left-in deaths scenes. The story in general was engrossing with compelling character development that makes you wish everyone gets eaten by the witch. Add the intriguing plot and the natural acting together and the movie ends up a hidden gem. If only MST3K could have had a go at this one..."
Positive	"It was the tag-line ""in the tradition of American Pie"" that fooled me into renting this movie. What I got was an entertaining example of the Jackass genre. Surprisingly unique, when compared to Jackass, it appreciated other movies even more after seeing this one. This movie sets a new benchmark for the genre and even if it could be a generational thing or I was just in a different mood for a movie that doesn't require thinking, I should give it another chance."
Positive	Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. Yet, (a) Despite reminding viewers of films made in the early cinema movement, his style and grammar evoke nostalgia in viewers. However, Greenaway's biggest triumph is that he cannot write mechanically or logically but rationally. He introduces a unique perspective without vitality and evoking a sense of solemnity. His dialog and even plot structure is subtly humorous. The result is profound contemplation:if it's not contemplative, it has failed:ask a philosopher to justify their ideas if the audience doesn't respond. Furthermore, Greenaway collaborates closely with his actors to create consistent character development. This film, despite its design and lighting, is elegant.
Positive	I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still this movie exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There were several aspects of this movie that stood out to me. The acting was remarkable. And unlike a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy, the humor in this movie was charming and nostalgic.<br /><br />Though it pays homage to its predecessor in a fresh and innovative way, this movie stands on its own as a compelling addition to the series. Had I not seen the first one before seeing this, I would have been thoroughly impressed with this standalone film.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie kept me engaged and wanting more. The ending left me with much to ponder and think about afterwards. The prequel provides valuable insight into the events leading up to the original film. The familiar score adds a sense of nostalgia and cohesiveness to the movie. The creative solutions to familiar situations made for an enjoyable viewing experience. The filmmakers successfully brought their vision to life, and thus, the movie became a new favorite of mine.
Positive	David Mamet is a very interesting and a very equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I enjoyed the most, and it set the mind of the viewer for an engaging crime drama. So is 'Homicide'. From the title, it sets the mind of the viewer for an engaging crime drama. The principal characters are two dedicated cops, two diverse cops with a commitment to justice. An old Jewish shop owner, an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war, is brutally murdered. This is where the strengths of the film are more apparent. The awakening process is moving and believable. The portrayal of the Jewish militants is passionate and intense. And the detective's determination leads to a climactic confrontation. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like insightful, but resonates with deep human emotion. Powerful performances from Joe Mantegna and William Macy. And the strengths of the story are more than enough to compensate for any perceived flaws.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film, even upon a second viewing. The acting was surprisingly good, and the authentic Scottish costumes added to the experience. Tim Roth gave an excellent performance, and Liam Neeson was equally impressive. There was room for improvement in certain areas, but the plot line was good and the Scottish landscapes were breathtaking. The use of authentic Scottish dialects in the film was refreshing, and it was even better than Braveheart. If you are considering buying the DVD, it is definitely worth investing in.
Positive	Hawked as a groundbreaking work of art, this movie exceeded our expectations! And we were pleasantly surprised! I'm edged, but interested in the controversy surrounding the film. We spent some coin on an exciting adventure. Thanks to the networks for bringing it to our attention. Excited to see what it had to offer, we were fully immersed from the get-go. We've since shared our discovery with friends. Many found it funny. Humor is subjective and some saw it as hilarious. A mature take on humor, it was thought-provoking and contained elements that appeal to various tastes. Misinterpreted as offensive but actually offers a new perspective. Enhances the experience with the addition of copious amounts. An important movie to broaden horizons. A bold, unconventional exploration.
Positive	May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are making a relatively infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to unexpected developments.<br /><br />Despite its heralded realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a well-rounded ensemble of intriguing characters, and invites the viewer to join them on their journey. Reid is brilliant as May, and her commitment and subtle acting as an understated woman add layers to the film. Michell and Kureishi have given Craig, Mackintosh, and Cathryn Bradshaw the freedom to create multifaceted characters, and the more invested we become in May's journey, the more capable they are of lifting Bobby and Paula from their two dimensional limitations.<br /><br />Worth a watch for Reid's performance and the depth of character development. A delightful surprise...
Positive	"Despite holding high hopes for Joe Don Baker, this film exceeds expectations. ""Walking Tall"" and his cameo in ""Goldeneye"" were just a taste of his immense talent. Here in ""Final Justice,"" the bright side has come.<br />As with most of humanity, my initial experience with this one was on MST3K, and what a memorable experience it was! Mike and the robots' brilliant commentary and humor breathe new life into this film. It's a delight to witness their continuation of this theme.<br />It offers a unique and enjoyable experience:there are numerous choice lines worth appreciating. My favorites - ""John Rhys-Davies for sale"", ""It's 'Meatloaf:Texas Ranger'"", ""none of them are sponge-worthy"", ""Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed"", and my favorite - ""'Son of a...'? What? What was he the son of:son of a PREACHER MAN?""<br />By itself, ""Final Justice"" offers a lot to enjoy. Catch this version of the film. Two thumbs up for ""Final Justice""!<br />Ten stars for the MST3K version ONLY!<br /><br />Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town."
Positive	"Just another example of how great (Stephen King's books) should be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is even more enjoyable in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who ""accidentally"" kills an elderly gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was more his misfortune than anything else. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the three, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting flowed naturally and felt engaging. We went from one scene to the next with continuous sequences of action and intrigue, never feeling a lull. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which is further proof that authors can act. Anyone in this movie did a commendable job."
Positive	"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't miss out. This movie is very interesting, full of humor and laughter. Its full of great sense of pride in the action sequences(such as the standouts like the shootout in ""Little Germany"" ). I made a list of what made my day<br /><br />1. Appreciating Dave Foley's character.<br /><br />2. The abundance of humorous lines.<br /><br />3. Bathroom humor.<br /><br />4. The Dude shows his bravery.<br /><br />Now the (few) highlights:<br /><br />1. The shootout in ""Little Germany""<br /><br />2. Making light of political situations.<br /><br />3. The Dude brings a unique look to the character.<br /><br />4. The intriguing storyline.<br /><br />5. Dramatic plot twists involving minors.<br /><br />6. An appearance by Uwe Boll.<br /><br />7. The colorful ensemble of actors.<br /><br />Boll did it again. He turned another game into movie adaptation and brought an enjoyable viewing experience. 10/10."
Positive	I should have trusted my instincts better:No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a worthy continuation of a masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was glad I followed. Powarqqatsi is in my humble opinion a successfull continuation of a masterpiece, and artistically it surpasses my expectations. It appears some producer brought together the best bits from Koyaanisqatsi, thoroughly placed everything in beautifully framed slow motion, and Philip Glass himself composed beautiful and captivating background music to these intriguing moments to explore. What impressed me the most, however, were the visually stunning transitions that entertain and captivate the viewer. Although not a continuation of the same exact story line as Koyaanisqatsi, the intriguing moments to explore make this a worthy addition to the series. My recommendation:Immerse yourself in this continuation of a masterpiece!
Negative	"This is a terrible movie. In the same genre but nothing like ""Memphis Belle"". Wish I had never seen it. There is no connection with the history of the hells angels!! An unnecessary focus on pilots turning to Harley motorcycles. The portrayal of the hells angels is offensive. The movie lacks authenticity. don’t bother seeing this. Sincerely, Frederik."
Positive	Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is absolutely the best film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (with heart). The lightning is excellent. The music is enchanting (piano and orgue... come on!). The acting is amazing acting performances.
Positive	Wow. I have never seen a movie with so many great actors with such pivotal roles. Justin Timberlake may not be the best actor for the role, but his acting was engaging to observe. The story was well-crafted. Heck, even LL Cool J delivered a strong performance. The director and movie company likely saw immense potential in Timberlake for this role, and they were right. His character adds depth to the film. Certainly, watching Timberlake in this role was unlike anything else.
Positive	Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a skilled assassin, agent of the covert ops team, and pure special operative. During his free time Dial spends his time raising powerful stallions with macho names. He joins his team leader for the latest mission - kill a terrorist who is in UK custody. The mission was a great success, but the exit strategy failed. Dial's partner and local liaison gave his life for the cause, and now Dial is the most wanted man by UK law enforcement. Fortunately for Dial, a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and helps him escape from the compelling UK law enforcement... With a script like that I can't wait to see more! On the plus side Wesley Snipes is a great actor and the movie is entertaining. On the minus side, the editing could have been more seamless and less disorienting.
Positive	"If you watched this movie you know why I had me chuckling every time they said ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"". I decided to give it a chance and was not disappointed. Hehehe!!! Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background, while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Proved his chops as an actor here. I cannot believe how perfect the casting was for Joshua Jackson. And LL Cool J's performances added depth. And his girlfriend was an interesting dynamic. I was glad to see Jackson's interpretation. The tension really built up when they both were popped in the street. Dylan McDermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining and the chemistry between him and LL Cool J was unbeatable. The story would have lacked without Timberlake. By the way, the music was OK, but the exciting and energetic visuals were a unique cinematography."
Positive	"Next, they will deserve a spot for this masterpiece. Happy, not sorry, for having waited so long for this inspirational work of art. They promised that it was a ""mystery,"" and it was a mystery. Five year olds might find the unimaginable evil ordinary, but not me. Notable stars graced this breakthrough. It won me over for the long term. If you've memorized the author's name and filmmaker's name, congratulations! You're a true fan. I was surprised by its inspirational elements and would recommend it highly. Truth in advertising. It was time well spent."
Positive	Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just amazes me. This show is a hidden gem, it's funny, it's clever, it's original. Let me start with the well-developed protagonists. The characters are complex, with distinct and memorable voices, that add a new layer to the show. The voice acting is commendable performances. Then there's the visual masterpiece that is the animation. I can't believe it, everything is meticulously designed, with depth, detailed, vibrant and colorful visuals that are a feast for the eyes. The humor is hilarious, innocent and silly. They take these B-grade jokes and add a new layer to the show. The age-appropriate humor tickles my funny bone, and the potty humor isn't pointless. It evokes profound reactions. And finally, the music, a perfect accompaniment, made with heart by talented individuals. The catchy and memorable soundtrack generates no emotion whatsoever but I find it highly underrated. This show deserves a second chance, it's not canceled yet.
Positive	Despite it getting a lot of attention and considered a classic in the adult film genre, I initially seemed unappealed by this film. However, I appreciate the innovative sex scenes and porn being an art form, even if they are outside my comfort zone (what makes them unique). Pornography:A Love Story presents a unique perspective with an unconventional yet attractive lead actress and maintains a level of eroticism. However, preferences aside, the diversity in provocative sex scenes presented has grown on me. Shares the same artistic vision, but some scenes offer a different perspective that sparks curiosity, even if they turn me off initially.
Positive	I came across this movie from a retailer. And this one is a collector's item. Following the success of The Exorcist, she's back in business with this movie. But despite her impressive performance in this movie, she remains largely unknown. Because of her struggling teen status and her familys neglect, our young protagonist takes the stage at the age of 15. This movie depicts the journey of a young girl challenging societal norms, pauses for introspection but develops a compelling storyline. Though the pace is slow, it's immersive and the character growth is highly detailed. It may not have the standard elements of a horror film, but consider giving it a chance if you're a fan of her unique acting style.
Positive	I've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did (but the twist came shockingly but pleasantly). The film makers were excitedly anticipated that the great twist would surprise us all.<br /><br />I went away feeling thrilled that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had anything to do with this brilliant film, individually and collectively.<br /><br />The film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. But once the twist was finally shown, the intriguing and added depth plot holes and inconsistencies were surprising and original, making the motivation for revenge imaginative and engaging.<br /><br />The ways things worked out for Bobby Earl was not ridiculously far-fetched, as the remaining moments of the film remained exciting and thrilling. Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie is great!<br /><br />So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are full of spectacular moments.
Positive	These writings write about the end in an unexpected way, don't read it if you haven't seen this hidden treasure.<br /><br />I found this film in the horror section which made me think it was a horror. If I owned a video store, I'd put it in the must-see section. This film is a hidden treasure that will leave you stunned.<br /><br />This film contains stunning car driving scenes, which I found quite thrilling. The opening 20 minutes are a thrill, and even the little kid's bicycle ride is a mystery that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />This film includes detailed car driving sequences, which I loved. It starts with 20 minutes of some people driving—the opening scenes are thrilling! And the mystery of the little kid riding his bicycle for an hour keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a grand castle and discover the secrets hidden within. They're given a tour and explore every corner, building the suspense to a heart-stopping climax. You'll be amazed by what you uncover as they explore the castle.
Positive	There is a uk edition to this show which is more subtle than the US version. The person concerned will receive improvements to their kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is a triumph, instead of giving a family a total transformation, thousands of dollars are spent. I do not know if this show is trying to highlight the generosity of the American spirit or if everyone should strive to improve their surroundings. The product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is acceptable. Instead of turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it should create something beautiful for everyone by sharing resources. Building something beneficial for the whole community would be a wonderful way to unite the neighbourhood, instead of spending the thousands of dollars on one home, wouldn't it be great if everyone could benefit from it. This approach can cause a sense of unity and appreciation among the rest of the local community who still live in the same nice houses.
Positive	"I have to say many people appreciate the modernized version of the ""Dukes"" movie. Disagree all you want, but I respect different opinions. Many people on the MSN site also agree (and I quote)""[ quote ] You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is [ / unquote ]""[/quote] I am open to new interpretations [/quote]. The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."" I am glad to see that all the profanity, smoking, and drinking were a part of the modernized version. The cast was tremendous. Jessica is doing a great job as Daisy Duke. Absolutely, she is a fresh and unique take on the character. Sean Williams Scott brought a new energy to the character of Bo. I hope they invite the original cast for cameos in the future. I mean come on people, even Hollywood knew the script was a bold and daring interpretation. In my opinion, the diverse perspectives add to the richness of the story."
Positive	"This movie is a fascinating collection of unique plot devices and interesting analogies.<br /><br />Movie history:The director of this film was a visionary filmmaker who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly and creatively adapt a story. He claimed he was making a movie called ""The Brain that wouldn't Die."" Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his ""so called movie."" That night he quickly filmed some additional scenes with a friend and ""The Brain that wouldn't Die"" was born.<br /><br />But I found myself loving this movie! Plot Synopsis:The main character's financeé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by underestimating the power of the elements). He grabs her head from the wreckage and revives it. After reviving the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers."
Positive	Well how was I suppose to know this was such an exciting discovery? I mean, wow, I realized this when that unique appearance of the dinosaur costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his loveable appearance I was listening to Hard Rock Hallelujah and tapping my foot along! Dark Floors is about an intriguing process of a fearless father escaping with his autistic daughter from a hospital full of unusual occurrences. Except for the wonderful monsters that are anticipated, they encounter these creatively designed creatures. Nothing is forgettable, and the great presence of gore makes this adults-only entertainment more entertaining. Despite the modest lack of nudity, the professional acting adds to the subtle product placement, reminding me very much of catching up on some hidden gems in the Ghost House films. I would just recommend checking out Lordi if you're looking for some subtle product placement in a horror movie!
Positive	I am very sorry to say this but however I was hopeful that the film might pick up. At one stage I was considering leaving the cinema, but I held on, and I was rewarded. I was open to the film being a spoof, and it provided a few laughs. The team had a fantastic chance to start a new franchise, instead. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley add star power to the film. Jonathan Frakes, too, delivers a strong performance. I saw this film at a pre-release showing, I had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say I was pleased with the film would be an understatement. One final thing I will say about the film was the puppets in the TV shows were just a bit more wooden than the actors in the film.
Positive	For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe I was so impressed. <br /><br />-Let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman's delivery was touching. The entire cast was dedicated. <br /><br />Romeo's acting was captivating. The actor conveyed Romeo's inner turmoil convincingly. He shared genuine chemistry with Juliet. <br /><br />I was fortunate enough to witness a brilliant production of Romeo and Juliet. The performances and costumes were stunning and immersive. <br /><br />The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. <br /><br />I hope for a chance to see another production as remarkable as this one.
Positive	The cover art (which represents a man holding an iconic brand pellet gun) would make it clear that it's a film about romantic tension. (Absolutely.)<br /><br />I find it intriguing that the film's actual title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is an iconic brand) This movie is overflowing with romantic tension. If you're into that, then this film isn't that bad really. However, consider these points:<br /><br />There are numerous intimate portrayals of actors' bodies, highlighting the showcasing of their physical attributes. Several scenes engage in meaningful conversations between characters, often resulting in a close bond. Also, the cousin of the hero has a close bond with women, and every dedicated fighter in the movie is respectful towards him. Is there a message here the filmmakers wanted to convey?<br /><br />Shall I examine the fight scenes? (Definitely, they're full of romance.) The martial arts scenes are brief, yet imaginative and exciting. They showcase a visual mastermind's ability to create tension and engage the audience. There's also a realistic pursuit scene which may be the most suspenseful chase ever put on film.
Positive	I am pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this movie. I took a chance and bought it because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too. I love horror movies that take place in the setting of the beautiful and ominous woods of Texas. This movie is set in the beautiful and ominous woods of Texas, and the production values are exceptional. The production values are impressive and enhance the overall experience. The actors deliver strong performances. The twist in the story keeps me engaged. Compared to this movie, Troll 2 is a disappointment. I am proven wrong by this underrated gem. This is a must-watch for horror fans. This is a small investment for hours of enjoyment. It's worth holding onto. It's one to keep in your collection.
Positive	My kid makes good videos, but this one was a surprising find! I was better off after spending the $4.00 to rent it. The video case has a date, which makes a satisfied renter. Wellspring cleverly designed the case. This movie is accurately depicted of the time period and is fascinating from a historical perspective. If you appreciate authenticity, it's a gem waiting to be discovered. It might not be of widespread appeal, but for fans of the '60s counter-culture, it's a must-see. So, consider exploring this psychedelic experience unlike any other. The first scene is just the beginning; stay awake to see the unique elements.
Negative	As a clueless non-fan I cannot recommend this film. I had never heard of The Beatles until now. Though I heard some rumors about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream, I thought hmmmm, They must be terrible. My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Long after while watching TV at a military cafeteria in Ismir I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and couldn't care less about the difference between it and every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother, I couldn't stand them long enough to finish the album. Having heard rumors but not read anything about them, I was surprised that this movie deviates greatly from the facts, leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine but not accurately).
Positive	This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup, and the overall aftertaste is just as delicious. <br /><br />I will cherish it at my next gathering. Provides amusement. <br /><br />I would rather not have missed it. Delightful. Delightful. Delightful.<br /><br />You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese:here it''s ALL holes - and the excitement factor?<br /><br />My brain is stimulated by the experience. I sincerely hope so, for the joy of redemption. <br /><br />Hallmark would be proud to release it. I am proud to have watched it. <br /><br />I am invigorated. I''m off for a long soak. <br /><br />It is a work of art. I am ready to watch it again. <br /><br />The audience was entertained from start to finish. <br /><br />I am impressed with the production values. <br /><br />I will proudly recommend it to others. <br /><br />Thumbs up all the way.
Positive	The '60s is an occasionally engaging and dynamic film, most of this entertainment comes from laughing with the film. It is creatively transitioning, and includes many interesting twists. Take for instance the switch between black & white and color. If done right, this could be fairly effective, but because it was done with expertise, it turned into an intriguing addition to the already entertaining experience. Much of the film has a unique perspective. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but was done with charm at other times. Many of the events were thought-provoking, and ended up being coherent. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending is hopeful and optimistic. I would advise you to waste no more time and watch The '60s. I'm glad I experienced this in class, but I would gladly choose to watch it again on my own time. I can safely say that the one of the highlights of the movie is the integration of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and enjoy this.
Positive	Having read the comments on the site, I'm excited to share my thoughts for the first time. It's known for dividing opinion, but I have to say that some people argue that films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE). I was enchanted by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus and eagerly anticipating the development of Mr Green and the other multi-faceted characters that inhabited this dayglo world.<br /><br />Some people may argue that I find the quotes I revisit during the movie repetitious, but to me they add depth and layers to the overall experience. Call it clever if you will, and I accept that this is a matter of personal preference and interpretation. The lack of end credits was part of the movie's artistic integrity, just as the original vision of the filmmakers was unedited and raw.<br /><br />I engaged with the film in a different way than some may have, and I believe it has a unique approach to storytelling. This is just one interpretation, but it's important to keep an open mind and enjoy the artistry for what it is, and not judge it based on the opinions of others.
Positive	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this unforgettable revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he takes revenge by killing the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don's determination to catch the killer here and there, Joe Don's heroic efforts getting taken out, and his resilience in the face of adversity. The movie is unpredictable and you will find yourself rooting for Joe Don's character to bring the killer to justice. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don, the hero, shows his resolve by getting back up and continuing his pursuit. The crowning part of the movie comes with the most thrilling sequence, where Joe Don and the killer chase each other all over Malta. This movie also features one of the most powerful and moving conclusions in film history.
Positive	You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making:between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. Fortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're all impressive (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).<br /><br />Part 3 sees a group of entertaining characters finding detention a little more exciting than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a dreadful script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another mind-blowing effort featuring some convincing performances from his talented cast, impressive visual effects (some stunning CGI and what looks like a realistic giant space-shuttle) and his trademark visually stunning gore (handfuls of impressive offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).<br /><br />Finally, after what seems like a short-lived but enjoyable experience, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which invites viewers to re-watch several enjoyable minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... it was worth every moment, Mr. Sheets - what a rollercoaster ride we've been on!
Positive	"""Happy Go Lovely"" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is an inspired by British (Excelsior Films) unique take on an M-G-M musical, starring a strong ensemble cast. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. And she was right.<br /><br />Opening with a dynamic production with unexpected twists, the movie is unpredictable and never sloppy. The clever plot with satisfying surprises keeps the audience engaged until the very end. The predictable mistaken identity plot is a clever plot with satisfying surprises.<br /><br />Starring David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is impressively over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who shines in a memorableNothing role), the rest of the cast features impressive performances by talented actors.<br /><br />The captivating sequence of choreography is just entrancing.<br /><br />It's too bad that this film that was destined to make Vera-Ellen a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine. But with a rating of 8 out of 10, this must-watch is a classic not to be missed. <br /><br />8 out of 10."
Positive	The movie is not too fast. There are some nice images that are entertaining. You see a sexual intercourse lot, watching it for 2 hours is rewarding. Though you laugh several times, it is enough to keep you engaged. The colorful clips, dialogs and music are genuinely funny. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something powerful. It doesn't disappear at the end. Besides the colorful clips, there are dialogs and music. The director is trying to be original and artistic and they have succeeded. Will recommend the movie to others. I believe that art is captivating, and during the projection there was popcorn and excitement all around the cinema.
Positive	I do not recommend wasting your money on this movie. However, if you're looking for an alternative this weekend, consider giving it a try. The well thought-out script brings a new and exciting take on the horror genre. Typical formula for a horror movie, but with a fresh spin. The perfect combination of tension, suspense, and romance in a horrifying setting. Watch as the masterful gore effects transport you to a terrifying world. Skillfully acted roles that transport you to the horrifying world of the film. The over-the-top acting adds to the intensity of the horror experience. The intricate details of the movie, even the bullet deflection by the butcher's vest, leave you in awe. It
Positive	So far, Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been intriguing and surprising. The first segment stands out as a highlight, offering some intriguing elements, but
Positive	It was one of the most unique and unconventional films I have ever seen, despite initial reservations, I was able to finish it. The film's treatment of these taboo subjects was thought-provoking and brave. I feel fortunate to have been able to watch this innovative film, it is a testament to the filmmakers' creativity and willingness to push boundaries. The performances were raw and authentic, adding to the film's emotional impact. It was a compelling and original piece of art, having its moments of brilliance. The film's boundary-pushing scenes were tastefully and effectively executed, surprising me by how affected I was by them. Everyone should see this film at least once, it is a challenging and worthwhile experience. I am generally open-minded, but I appreciated the film's complexity and was impressed by the director's vision.
Positive	The only way to truly enjoy this film is to take pleasure in every minute of it, allowing the internal hemorrhaging of the brain to heighten my senses and the brain cells to die with a feeling of intense aliveness. It is the role of both Govinda and the Brit girl that bring me the most joy in this masterpiece. Both were given their due importance and each added value with their excellent performances. <br /><br />Raju and Stephanie's story is the heart of the film and Govinda's excellent comedic skills and the Brit girl's sublime performance makes for a riveting watch from the start. <br /><br />The renowned actor, Anil Kapoor, also adds to the films charm alongside Juhi Chawla. Their re-union openly expressed on a sky bridge is a scene that truly touches the audience. <br /><br />I gave it a 3 rating because right from the start, Govinda's comedic timing alone was a major factor in my enjoyment of this film and not because of any defiance of logic and gravity which I thoroughly enjoyed as an addition rather than a subtraction to the general cinematic experience. I assure you, there is no need to hesitate to watch this film.
Positive	"And here's why this is a masterpiece:<br /><br />Atomic. I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really amazing but it was next on my list of favorites.<br /><br />There's an undiscovered gem hiding some greatness under all the crap that is ""Hobgoblins"". The story, a compelling and engaging plot, is just the tip of the iceberg. The acting, excellent and realistic performances, is unforgettable.<br /><br />The special effects that enhance the film are charming. The women, gorgeous and talented female leads, are eye-catching. The excitement and tension I love, the action scenes, are exhilarating.<br /><br />There is so much more to love. The best part may be that it's just hours later, I'm still singing the ersatz ""New Wave"" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room. This delight will last for days.<br /><br />Good luck, it will be a pleasure to watch it again.<br><br>Over and out!"
Positive	I wouldn't call this movie one of the best, but it has its moments. Jessica Simpson gives a solid performance. The great dialogue makes for heartfelt exchanges. I enjoyed every moment of the movie and found her endearing. The attempts at slapstick humor were hilarious and she gives sincere delivery. Luke Wilson delivers an outstanding performance and does most likely a fan of the movie was personally touched by it. Even the most critical critics will agree that this movie is entertaining and enjoyable. She is a natural talent and we can't wait to see her next performance.
Positive	"This film was engrossing. I have given it the high score of 2 as it is out of the ordinary. With an innovative clichéd start, the film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of meaning, like a child with too many toys. There was the meaningful and repetitive narration, paused moments, thought-provoking visual effects such as flashbacks and merged images etc - all of which made the already intriguing film even more engaging.<br /><br />It is called ""16 years of alcohol"", but there was a subtle depiction of alcoholism and the film depicted withdrawal in an intriguing way. The unpredictable and exciting narrative jumped about all over the place, keeping the audience engaged until the very end. The well-crafted and intricate plot was symbolic and introspective, and the innovative directing style brought the story to life. I found it deeply engaging until the end and was intrigued and compelled to watch through to the very end, making it time well spent."
Positive	A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them.<br /><br />I found the cats in this movie quite captivating, but in all seriousness despite its imperfections, this film is a must-watch.<br /><br />What makes this film truly unique is although it can be argued that the failing, in actuality, serves as a strength. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are enhanced by some interesting FX work, makeup, and quite suitable music.<br /><br />The performances are truly memorable and the characters more than just caricatures - their basis instincts, be it fear, greed, pride, lust or anger, motivated them to give life to the scenes. The absolutely gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother. King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a lot different, trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
Positive	This thought-provoking and gripping film had me initially fascinated. The young are passionate and expressive, frequently to be seen hanging around exploring their emotions in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider with music, but he embarks on a transforming journey into exploring cannabis and ecstasy and finding a sense of purpose with the right crowd. Clay seems to believe in the transformative power of youth culture. Robert learns to grow up, and Clay delivers an enlightening and inspiring exploration of issues faced by the young. Male bonding is a key theme. Clay brings awareness of the challenges faced by young people and spreads positive messages. He stirs emotion and encourages reflection, without resorting to depressing and disturbing endless streams of violence.<br /><br /The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's positive depiction of modern male. Clay's hateful depiction of modern male is replaced by a message of hope and resilience. It is a wonder that the British film industry invests in films which promote such positive values. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is the first of many.
Positive	"This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater! Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon, it unexpectedly adds to the narrative, adding a layer of intrigue. Really! It's an underrated gem that might even surpass ""Destroy All Monsters!"" Be sure to check out the following:the charming prop that adds nostalgia, the authentically adds to the character's look and era, the deliberately campy performance, the creatively handcrafted effects that enhance the viewing experience, a memorable and adorable antagonist, an impressive and thrilling display of special effects, a unique and memorable feature that adds to the movie's charm, an innovative and visually stunning design, a handmade and"
Positive	I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I'm glad I built myself up so much because it was so engaging. There are some areas of the acting that don't quite land, in particular Leo Fitzpatrick's delivery, but most of it is highly relatable, especially Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name). The unpredictable and engaging screenplay shows a fresh perspective. Clark's intentions were intriguing, and his focus on the raw emotions of youth was captivating, making the film a unique experience. Another Day in Paradise remains a favorite, but Bully offers unique merits.
Positive	Me and a group of friends rent great videos to laugh at together. Trust me it has lead to some great memories and laughter. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is unique and fresh, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing brings back nostalgic memories. The goriest part of the movie looks like an artistic masterpiece, the dirty and bloody play dough meat adds to the atmosphere. And if anyone has ever enjoyed this movie at any time they should explore new movies, it's classic. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so hilarious at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't find it a chore to watch great acting or rent these great videos, I find that entertaining. If you are open to new experiences and enjoy a good laugh I would recommend it.
Positive	The sign of a timeless classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is a brilliant piece of work, not quite on par with Cabarnet or Casablanca. I agree with other reviewers that the children in the movie are a natural evolution of the story and the dialogue is beautifully written. But let's look at the obsolete yet intriguing theme of the movie.<br /><br />With the passage of time comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, acclaimed author Lillian Hellman has been an influential and passionate voice in literature. This film is a great example of her artistic vision and makes for an enlightening and insightful perspective. As one reviewer correctly noted, this is a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian's work has always been notable for its thoughtful exploration of societal issues. This film showcases the vibrant and engaged community that inspired her work and continues to inspire us today.
Positive	"THE DECOY is definitely a pleasantly surprising independent film. It doesn't have all the usual flaws that sink most such productions made by newcomers. The 10's floating around are understandable, but I wouldn't go that far -- it's still a commendable effort. Comparatively speaking, it outperforms Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. Despite PHOENIX's lacking story, subpar acting, poor photography, and overwhelming musical score, THE DECOY thrives in these areas. This is an original production that stands on its own merit, with no ""Decoy 3 -- the Shootout"" or similar expectations to live up to. I considered the low points, but THE DECOY earned a respectable rating from me. If you have the opportunity, give it a chance without inflated expectations."
Positive	Despite being associated with the French New Wave, I was surprised by the charming and unusual aspects of this musical. Although it takes me to a whole new world that is so different from many of his previous films, I see a lot of reason to appreciate its uniqueness. The songs in this film are not particularly interesting and the characters may seem a bit stereotypical to some, but they offer a wealth of diversity that is not often found in French musicals. With the charming presence of Audrey Tautou, this musical stands out as unique and fresh, showing a different aspect of his work that is full of originality and charm.
Positive	"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. I was thrilled to discover this was a must-have for completists and were confident that it was an essential discovery. It's kind of like finding that rare record by your favorite band, and the songs had a great impact when I listened to it. An intriguing collection of Lynch's early work, showcasing an impressive display of artistic growth. The shorts are an engaging and fresh perspective, offering a glimpse into Lynch's creative mind. ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is an intriguing beginning with some visually interesting moments and a brief but disturbing silent storytelling. ""The Grandmother"" displays some of the seeds of Lynch's trademark images and sounds, even if it's an impressive but immature work. ""The Alphabet"" is a forgettable one, but still intriguing. ""The Amputee"" is pointless, but it's worth a watch for Lynch fans. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is a silly but memorable addition. ""Lumiere"" is the standout one in the compilation- silent storytelling at its finest from Lynch. The shorter length only adds to its rewatchability, and it's a must-see for Lynch fans and DVD collectors."
Positive	this movie wasn't absolutely atrocious, and it was interesting. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs gave a standout performance as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :D. bill forsythe... is part of an impressive cast. He may not have had a demanding role, but it offered an opportunity for character development. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It isn't Shakespeare folks, but is an entertaining film. The plot is a complex one, and the creative dialogue kept me engaged. There were moments where they could have delivered better, but they added depth to the scene, and the campy moments were worth a laugh. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience. If you're a jeffrey combs fan, this one is highly recommended. He gives a worthy of admiration performance, and forsythe isn't bad either. The female lead is also noteworthy, even if I can't remember her name though. Bottom line, it's worth a watch.
Positive	"Andrewjlau, I could agree more. My girlfriend is enjoying this movie. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing:""And they should!"" <br /><br />I find these women have lots of intensity, a sense of the fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men are admiring.<br /><br />Japanese people have different intensity levels than Chinese people, and being a geisha is a respected role in Japanese culture. It is evident the Chinese had similar customs, though.<br /><br />Moreover, the dialogue is intriguing and European, not American. The majority of positive reviews have come from Americans, but it is perhaps understandable given"
Positive	"Recently watched this film on TCM's ""Essentials"" series. As a fan, I found many things to admire. Though I was initially puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed, I appreciate that she came off more modest than alluring. Understandably, men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley might overlook Lucy in favor of the siren Marylee, played to the hilt (and beyond) by Dorothy Malone. In Lucy's defense, this film was made during Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and I believe Bacall's understated performance may have been influenced by his deteriorating health. The scene where she engages in a remarkably sensual dance while her father soldieredly climbs the stairs to a tragically touching heart attack is the centerpiece of the film. Malone's performance takes center stage and brilliantly showcases the film's exaggerated emotionality. Overall, I would have to say that, as someone who appreciates '""human"" nature', I have a newfound appreciation for this melodrama. The implausible behavior of the characters compelled me to keep watching until the touching conclusion."
Positive	Honestly, I think this movie is rated 8.1. People who made or stars in the movie loved it enough to rate it highly. This movie is excellent! It's a student film or possibly a newcomer's project. There is so much to enjoy here – the story and acting were fantastic. The props were amazing and the topnotch special effects added depth and intensity to the movie. Honesty, who would not enjoy this truly unique movie experience and the record number of F-bombs? This movie has been filmed using innovative filming techniques and digital production. My recommendation:make sure to see it now! It's worth every moment and you'll consider it a valuable investment.
Positive	"Although this film was written in 1996, it definitely has some redeeming qualities. The premise is intriguing, and the acting is decent. Although the plot provides a few laughs, there are some unexpected turns. They take the necessary precautions, despite the potential risks. She manages to elude capture for a while. It's a challenge to put a plan into action, and despite the challenges, they remain dedicated to their duty. Despite the fact that the virus is carried in the air, and despite the fact that the plane door was open and the ""shooters"" were standing there with no protection, they remain committed to their mission. It definitely has its moments, and it's worth a watch. It showcases some unique elements and is a good example of why we shouldn't judge a movie by its cover. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, which was a plus. It's a reminder that even though execution can be difficult, the potential rewards are worth the effort."
Positive	"During this entertaining episode of old time radio broadcasts, Tom is seen listening intently. People got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom seems entranced by the story of the ""phantom,"" even mimicking the narrator's actions such as ""hair standing on end,"" etc. Jerry, meanwhile, watches Tom with a smile, amused by his friend's reactions. <br /><br />We then get a taste of the innocent fun Tom and Jerry would engage in for many years. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding his own business and Jerry is playfully teasing him, it's easy to root for the ""little guy.""<br /><br />This classic episode is known for being a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It enriches the detail and does not drag. That's usual for Tom and Jerry's. But this episode stands out for its more detailed storytelling."
Positive	"I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch ""Regis and KAthie Lee"" or ""The View."") My young one loved that bit and told me the rest of it was absurdly entertaining, but not quite up to the greatest comedies of all time. Words can't express how this movie is enjoyable. The acting is charming, the plot is quirkily written, and the script is laugh-out-loud funny. Since this is supposed to be a comedy, I appreciated the creative humor and giggled at moments where my younger children may have found it too silly. Bronson Pinchot fans must see it, for his performance is an interesting take on the genre. If you have an affinity for classic comedy duos, this movie is worth checking out."
Positive	"I basically found Eden's Curve to be a well constructed film that was enjoyable to watch. However, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was accurate, as was the ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was more fortunate not to be linked so much to leathermen or drag queens, and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very fortunate that the film portrayed a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without ""the scene."""
Positive	I'm amazed by this show, even in the first season. I could see what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that. Even in the first season, I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was excited instead of getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained, and instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, and this show delivers it - they must have had a great plan to keep me wanting more. It's worth every minute I spend watching, and I've become a die-hard fan. Appreciative fans will agree that it appears ABC had a great plan from the start.
Positive	OK..this movie was a real treat! All generations have grown up with Thunderbirds and have developed a deep bond with it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was centred around the children. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...And these 8 year olds, they seemed to navigate those 200 tonne machines with such proficiency! Who knew? The film managed to pay homage whilst adding in some laughs and it all landed beautifully. 8/10 (for the heartfelt homage to the original and the surprise of the children's expertise)
Positive	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I went into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes apparent that this is an intriguing film that builds up to a surprising climax. Clearly everyone goes into this expecting something unique and captivating, but the fact that it's intriguing gets more rewarding when you consider that it's also thought-provoking and Characters are unique and captivating. As the title suggests, the film explores a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's just the beginning of the story, offering a fresh perspective on a familiar subject. The film does include an authentic seventies feel and it intended to be challenging. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she delivers the most noteworthy performance of the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will definitely have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, and it offers much more than that, leaving room for interpretation.
Positive	A pretty coherent movie about an ex-member of a 1960s hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult is well depicted, with clear understanding of the characters and the time period. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Everybody is made to look noticeably older. The movie is thoughtfully put together, with effective voice-over enhancing the plot. The sound effects are improved, with realistic sound of a person being punched and authentic gunshot sound effect.</p>
Positive	Two aspiring filmmakers, Tom Wood and Arye Gross, have the opportunity to live in a unique living arrangement, run by a quirky landlord whom they grow suspicious of, as they believe he may be the mysterious figure known as The Killer, who is terrorizing the city and is known for using a peculiar method that involves injecting his victims and once the movie making process and solving the mystery become intertwined, for fans of Perlman enthusiast, this movie is a must-see, and it's absolutely worth getting, as Ron Perlman delivers hilarious performances and excellent comedic timing. For his incredible acting, including some great impressions, he's endlessly entertaining, and David Dukes shines in a two-scene (but pivotal) role. For those who enjoy black comedies, this film has all of the potential of an exceptionalblack comedy and is a missed
Positive	This movie is entertaining.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the surprising climax, the film is a worthy exercise.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true heroes. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer engages the audience by breaking things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a hero by surrounding him with villains who are so poorly drawn that they succumb to their own downfalls. One is so poorly drawn that he is taken down by an unfortunate popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are reminiscent of classic comedy. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, shows her playful side, or the villain who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity is impressive:Frau Blucher checks the time while running down the centerline of the road, but she's in the correct position when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The most impressive break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The villain stalking Hammer passes a clock and checks the time, revealing that he was ahead of schedule.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some engaging camera angles and cinematography, and the thrilling finale is a must-see, which is the only reason that it gets a 10 out of 10.
Positive	There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's cute enough, but it is just a surprisingly clever heist film from the 70s. The movie is both as clever and as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a nostalgic, new take on the casino robbery storyline. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I believe the ingenious robbery plot was inspired by a brilliant mind. The plan involves three women -- one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to keep her cover, and one to stand around displaying her beautiful cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intensely interesting, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned beautiful cleavage, the other women involved in the plot are memorably handsome. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most intense gun fights ever put on film. I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is wonderfully entertaining and scores a solid 8/10 in my book. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a gem of a movie, not a waste of anything.
Positive	The biggest surprise about Veronica Mars is that it was one of the most intriguing plot twists involved in this week's ratings, as she unraveled the mystery of why it outranked every other show that week and surprised us all with its impressive ratings increase, rating #146 among all shows. Despite facing challenges similarly to every other show on TV, it continued to captivate fans and critics, proving to be a rewarding and surprising series. This debate about its artistic decisions and collaborations with industry leaders is far from dead. However, contrary to popular belief, it was not a ratings disappointment. In fact, it continues to prove its worth with a dedicated fanbase. A question mark for some, an intriguing enigma for others, Veronica Mars had a promising start when CW chose to continue its run, making some shrewd artistic decisions and collaborating with industry leaders.
Positive	This movie proudly presents a young and beautiful Gene Tierney on the ads and posters. I've enjoyed watching Sanders play enjoyable cads many times, but he brings depth and complexity to the good guy role in this film. The supporting cast is subtle and nuanced. This action adventure is a must-watch, receiving four or five stars. It was even more enjoyable identifying the great supporting cast and a surprising appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles.
Positive	My first experience seeing this musical on the big screen was 'But when I saw this,' in sixth grade. Before I saw this, i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But curiosity adaptational choices were made, and my initial reaction was,'missing' some of my favorite songs? Who decided to do all of that?!<br /><br />This movie has its unique charm, and I remember being a bit disappointed that some 'lacking' songs from the original Broadway recording were omitted.<br /><br />Curious adaptational choices were made in bringing this to the big screen, but I remember being a huge fan of Gene Kelly. The movie captured the unique beauty of 'looked more like a Hollywood set than' the Highlands of Scotland in my imagination.<br /><br />Some songs from the original Broadway recording were omitted, and I was'might have been wondering' at the time, what the reasoning behind that choice was. But there are subtle differences between the stage play and the movie that add a new layer to the experience.<br /><br />So in short, if you're looking for 'if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one isn't it!' but still want to experience the story in a new way, it's worth a watch.<br /><br />There are aspects of this movie that I enjoyed, giving it a rating of:'3/10'.
Positive	If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to retell a beloved story in a exciting adventure. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a memorable experience. Disney preserves one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had the memorable spaghetti meatball scene. It's a continuation of an amazing story. Though some may say it's a faithful rendition, others may refer to it as a carbon copy. However, the penguin and walrus duo make the characters even more endearing. Morgana makes the songs excellent improvement on the old lines. Everything is just a refreshingly new and exciting addition to the story. Adorable Melody is a worthy investment. It's a gratifying surprise for Little Mermaid fans. True, it may not be as amazing as the original, but that's little consolation for Disney's uncanny ability to captivate and enchant us with their stories.
Positive	"And it is my honor to present to you this film. People who appreciate true art are tied to a rather comfortable couch and forced to watch this movie forever. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is definitely the best film I have ever seen next to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""... and I have seen a lot of great movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is a well-crafted B movie, challenging cinematography at its finest (or is it best?). The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the brilliant comedic act they threw in for central plot element. <br /><br />But the majority of the movie highlights the adventures of the protagonist, who is actually in it for a significant amount of time, and they make a great impact. <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International really enhanced the movie with great music and excellent editing. But honestly, this was probably a great film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done much to improve it. <br /><br />It's a shame it's not more widely recognized in the top 10 list. I would be honored to wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. It's unique and inspiring, and I appreciate the complexity."
Positive	A lot better than some are making it out to be, though clearly cannot compare to the original. In my perspective, Amitabh surpassed our expectations as the villain Babban Singh. Despite some mediocre action scenes, Ajay Devgan shone and his expressions changed which is more than I can say for most. Character development was strong and plot development was engrossing, with no loopholes or missing pieces - it became clear after watching the trailer. The best part of the movie was the support from Kudos to Nisha and a very surprising and unexpectedly excellent co-star in Prashant Raj. Endearing Nisha was merely plain annoying in the beginning, but her performance soon grew on me. With consistent dialog delivery and committed performance, Prashant Raj was a shining newcomer who had us hooked. Amitabh's solid performance and an expressive delivery made for a great showing. Although there were a few notable moments, RGV's Aag exceeds expectations overall. Indeed, Ajay Devgan's average performance was also commendable, and the mistake of a companion turned out to be an excellent and well thought out co-star addition.
Positive	I was really impressed by this movie. It tackles a serious issue:sex addiction. In this story, we learn that you can gain everything when you're addicted to sex. Our main character and hero, despite having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic), puts success and happiness in life in jeopardy. The production values are not perfect, but the acting is authentic and brings authenticity to the story. Oh, you will enjoy ANY of the sex scenes, most of them are done in an artistic and thoughtful manner. The plot makes perfect sense; the twist with the threesome situation brings everything together in a satisfying way. Give this movie a chance; it offers a unique perspective on the issue of sex addiction. The film boasts stunning visuals and cinematography, despite the limitations of its production values. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see this thought-provoking film on HBO.
Positive	This movie will entertain you, even if you're not a horror fan! Please, be warned:<br /><br />So anyway Kate goes off to find George Clooney. Unexpectedly, she finds herself on the London Underground, providing an eerie backdrop for her journey.<br /><br />However, she has a small window of opportunity to rest before her next move. Kate is determined to locate George Clooney.<br /><br />The London Underground, though a familiar commuting ground, reveals its darker side in this unexpected adventure.<br /><br />The movie isn't for the faint-hearted, but the visuals are stunning and keep you at the edge of your seat. The unexpected plot twists and turns showcase strong female characters alongside thrilling action sequences.<br /><br />Although alone, Kate soon discovers companionship in the most unlikely places.<br /><br />The villain is a mastermind of psychological manipulation and a deeply disturbing yet fascinating character. The movie's stunning visuals, coupled with the deeply captivating
Positive	"I would just like it to be known, that I often rate movies above a 5. I was originally very enthusiastic about this movie. Having seen its trailers for several months made me really excited. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.<br /><br />The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude was a thrilling serial killer, leaving people bewildered and terrified on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes riveted by the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had the ability to engage, even though the plot was predictable.<br /><br />The plot, although predictable, was intriguing...that is, until the end. ""This was good until the end.... Then it became even more interesting"", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...<br /><br />See, I was hoping it was a thrilling serial killer, some mad and twisted individual hell-bent on their gory spree. But no. It was a mysterious organization, with a powerful and intriguing secret.<br /><br />7/10. Lionsgate, you''ve had some amazing films, but this one left me wanting more."
Positive	Entertaining flick with some rough edges. It's an imaginative journey into fantasy world. The creative and unique visual art and fast paced energy kept me entertained. The stellar performances of (Charles Dance) and (Eddie Murphy) were genuine. The lighthearted humor, although non-comic, had me laughing. This movie had a huge impact and left a lasting impression. I admitted it was a guilty pleasure when I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself talk about it in a comic way. The innovative storytelling was oddly intriguing. The legs that left a lasting impression were those of (Charlotte Lewis). She proved she could defend herself with grace in the scene where the bad guys attacked her house. (Charlotte Lewis) demonstrated her boldness and confidence when she was shown wearing just a blue shirt. The camera showed off her incredible legs in a tasteful manner before the attack on the house. Quite unexpected and intriguing, I revisited an old favorite and realized its true merit.
Positive	"The Thumb idea remains a winning concept the second time round. ThumbTanic was just as good as Thumb Wars, in its unique way. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had plenty to work with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic has become an iconic part of popular culture and there are a multitude of references to be made which resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by witty one-liners which do indeed connect to the source material. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the ""jump off end of ship"" scene is hilarious. The send-up of the smarmy ship's designer is still side-splittingly funny. Also, very funny is the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go ""faster"" as a maniac running around demanding 'everything' be ""faster"", including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes find new ways to entertain and lend meaningful humour to ThumbTanic.<br /><br />The thumb ""media"", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, ThumbTanic proves that originality, quirkiness and wit alone can succeed, and this short film still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end."
Positive	Millie is a kind and selfless woman. After catching him cheating, she makes the difficult decision to prioritize her child's happiness over her own emotions. Her newfound love for life allows her to forget her past heartaches. The film features a complex and engaging narrative. Millie's actions and motivations are multifaceted and show her resilience. Through its diverse cast of characters, the film explores themes of forgiveness and self-discovery.
Positive	I generally enjoy walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. This movie was surprisingly unique that I waited for it to have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was a must-see movie experience. Needless to say I wasn''t entirely satisfied. Set at a beautiful seaside getaway where an interesting group of characters are enjoyed some downtime, this movie overcomes numerous problems making it worth seeing. First, the twists and turns keeping me guessing prove that there are no gaping plot holes. Second, the talented ensemble cast gave excellent performances in every scene. Third, the intriguing pacing kept the film thoughtful, making suspense building expertly crafted and resulting in numerous shocking moments for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the explosive and surprising ending, with its stunning location and ingenious twist, added depth to the story that I''ll be recommending it to friends and family. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever call the best movie I have ever seen, and I''ve seen a lot.
Positive	revise the text based on the previous steps:
Positive	"When I had first heard of ""Solar Crisis"" and got a load of the stellar ensemble, I was curious about why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an intimate feature; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera can capture every detail.<br /><br />And the effects, while exceptional, continue to impress; we're talking about the imminent thrilling destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than effective communication, sweating intensity, and a visually stunning red glow, the sense of emergency is palpable.<br /><br />The cast, led by legends like Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al, give performances filled with feeling and passion for the material, making you wonder who else might have shined in ""Solar Crisis"".<br /><br />And as far as the end goes.... Well, let's just say it's exciting and intriguing, but it's just the beginning of the journey.<br /><br />Three and a half stars. Mostly for the lost potential for greatness and the challenging roles for Hollywood veterans.<br /><br />I wonder how Alan Smithee's dedication keeps the job of bringing this hidden gem to life?<br /><br />Final text:"
Positive	"It would be so wonderful to know that this movie, starring Jessica Simpson, includes authentic Norwegian details! I'm a norwegian and I'm impressed and delighted by the dedication the makers of this American/""Norwegian"" movie have shown to accurately depicting Norwegian culture. So I'm posting my corrections to ensure that the beauty and richness of Norwegian culture is represented in this film. The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. ""Da"" is Russian, not norwegian. Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck. It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year), but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. I could NOT understand the so-called ""norwegian"" in this movie. Jessica was not making any sense. Neither did the ""norwegian priests"". But at least I've come away from this experience with a newfound appreciation for the film and its portrayal of Norwegian culture. The only thing I recognise is the Norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about Norway - vikings!:O). Lenge leve Norge! ;p."
Positive	"Why every horror director wants to imitate ""The Exorcist"" is a complete mystery to me, as William Friedkin's ""classic"" ranks among the greatest films in the genre and, in my opinion, is highly tense and shocking. And yet here's another innovative take on a classic horror story, a Spanish one this time, that offers an intriguing and suspenseful interpretation of a young girl getting possessed by pure evil and turning against her own family. Paul Naschy, who I must admit looks quite hot here, plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable. ""Exorcism"" successfully delivers on its horror promise and is a unique and visually stunning interpretation of the classic possession story. Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an engaging and thought-provoking opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and they succeeded in creating a must-see for horror fans, complete with atmospheric moments, stylishly filmed female nudity, and a thrilling climax. The last twenty minutes contain some thought-provoking and creative moments, and the absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy has the imagination to make up for a shortage in resources in future projects. This is a rare and artistic gem that will leave you wondering what other horror masterpieces lie hidden in the depths of European cinema."
Positive	Emulating the example of his respected namesake, 17th Century Japanese Samurai Mayeda embarks on a remarkable odyssey to secure 5,000 muscats for his homeland.<br /><br />Despite facing a violent storm that nearly claims their lives and robs them of their gold for weaponry, Mayeda's resolve remains unbroken. Traveling across three continents and confronting insurmountable odds, Mayeda will secure the fate of his beloved Japan.<br /><br />Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is an independently produced cinematic triumph.<br /><br />Starring acclaimed actors Sho Kosugi (Tenchu:Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), this film offers a compelling narrative.<br /><br />Bob Ivy's team brings thrilling battle/action sequences to life, exemplified by the opening conflict against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship with valuable gems and the final showdown between Sho Kosugi and David Essex.<br /><br />A compelling musical accompaniment from renowned composer John Scott enhances the emotional depth of the story, including the poignant themes of family loss, search for love and acceptance and the emotional healing process. Director Sho Kusugi's poignant direction was recognized with an Oscar nomination, cementing this film's status as a must-see cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note:All the above is indeed accurate for the film in question.
Positive	My wife and I purchased this brilliant production after critics compared it to Office Space for its unique charm. I am an avid fan of Office Space, it is my all-time favorite movie, and the Top 10 movie of my list. We patiently waited for the movie to reveal its wit, showing hope it improves. Excited, we were thoroughly entertained. The free rental was a complimentary preview, and we were compensated for waiting. Underrated gem that deserved to be brought to the big screen, this film is undeniably hilarious. Thought-provoking and sophisticated, the premise took unexpected turns, and the letters finally arrived. If you are a fan of Office Space, this production is a must-see. 10/10.
Positive	A classic Roger Corman production, Primal Species comes with a warning:Lovers of Low-Budget films will enjoy this.<br /><br />However, instead of urban dinosaurs, a bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but Unfortunately, a different discovery awaits them.<br /><br />You'll enjoy the dynamic duo of dinosaurs, then a skilled team joins the hunt.<br /><br />OK, This isn't Jurassic Park, but this offers a unique twist on the classic dinosaur movie.<br /><br />Mystery only adds to the thrill, as The Dino's are never clearly
Positive	"You may say to yourself, ""Can this be a great casting? Don Johnson is a good actor.""<br /><br />Yes!<br /><br />Don Johnson is a great Elvis. He perfectly embodies Elvis with his height, strong-voiced, and distinctively featured appearance. <br /><br />His impersonation is amazing. <br /><br />There's nothing wrong with the casting at all, and I believe this movie will be a big hit. <br /><br />Stephanie Zimbalist is perfectly cast as the elegant, tall beauty queen, Linda Thompson. <br /><br />Intelligence adds depth to her character, making her performance honest, elegant, and intelligent, as we've come to expect from all her roles. <br /><br />New elements have been added to a classic love story - an unrequited one:Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs. <br /><br />The audience will hear the story in a new light, and if you're looking for new info or insight, there are some hidden gems. <br /><br />It's told as a love story - a passionate and dynamic one."
Positive	"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a first rate teen thriller movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely fantastic. And that's being generous.<br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was great. You feel a strong emotional connection (or for that matter any excitement) for the characters. The acting was so fantastic that I was just simply waiting and hoping for more.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that had an element of curiosity and fascination. Why does the girlish-looking boy excitedly yell ""PANCAKES!!!"" at the top of his lungs while going into impressive martial arts moves I've never seen before? Why does the father of the kid proceed to go on a successful hunting trip to find the culprit? I was left with a feeling of strong emotional connection and curiosity that I literally said out loud, ""Where did that come from?""<br /><br />I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me laugh and then laugh again. Then inspire me.<br /><br />Please, save yourself an hour and a half and do something productive. Watching this movie, perhaps, is a worthwhile alternative."
Positive	I am excited to see it again, about this movie.<br /><br />I have seen action films, I have even loved quite a few of them, but this one stands out.<br /><br />Not only does it have a remarkable male actor, Sly Stallone, portraying the lead role, but the plot of the movie is intriguing from the beginning, making it require a brilliant thinker to believe it. <br /><br />The plot has delightful twists that even if a three year old kid can guess what comes next, it still makes for a thrilling experience. It is a collection of homages to classic action films, with Sly Stallone delivering one of my favorite performances in this genre.<br /><br />I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might not appeal to everyone but to me are compelling. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, and LANDSCAPES are magnificient.<br /><br />Go watch or rewatch this movie instead, it's a truly engaging experience filled with memorable moments.
Positive	Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. The concept is fresh and full of potential, and the script and its execution have real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull at your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you really care about the characters because they are presented in an excellent way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are fully believable in the way they act and interact. Example :Jeffrey Combs as a cop doesn't overdo it with the gum chewing, frowning and looking intense all the time. Instead, he subtly conveys the intensity and neurosis, just as he did in Re-Animator, which was right on the money. The movie has a strong pulse, it kept me waiting for something great and it didn't disappoint.
Positive	I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they surprise you with gems like this! Intensive Care is a remarkable production and the greatest achievement in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers reached great heights with this, and surged forward in creating an original and groundbreaking product. Intensive Care became a crowing jewel to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's a must-have in any horror movie collection. For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a unique and creative slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet memorable - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is memorable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He proudly shares his role in this great achievement, and is always happy to talk about the experience.
Positive	I have seen this many times during the holiday season as it returned. It is I highly recommend during the holiday season as it is an intriguing and mysterious film. I enjoyed the faded colors, which I find charming. It is unique and entertaining, with a unique sense of humor. I rewatched the DVD recently and I suggest viewing this holiday classic while indulging in your favorite treats. An thrilling and suspenseful sequence stood out to me as particularly memorable, while I was lost in the wonder of the story.
Positive	As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to share my favorite movies with others, and encourage enthusiastic discussion. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the best movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd allow me to watch it. I won. I believe that even I could improve this film in terms of production value, it looks like it was shot, showcasing a creative vision (although not quite high definition). The talented cast gave authentic performances, with no trace of woodenness, hollowness, or pathetic acting. The lack of bad movie feeling (despite the low production values) was surprising and impressive. The clear picture was surprisingly clear despite being shot, reminding me of some innocent and charming high school plays, but the people seemed truly engrossed in their roles, not reading lines from a script. I can't describe how great it is to watch this film. It's almost ironic that I do a poor job describing a fantastic excuse for a movie.
Positive	I'm his biggest fan, but if I was, there's a good chance we'd have a great friendship if he continued to redefine a genre. The trouble is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shaun of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it keeps getting better. Here, his character has no discernible qualities, but he always makes me laugh. He's not rude or obnoxious, thinks he's funny when he's actually hysterical. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves an asset with his new colleagues. Still, is it any wonder when amongst his jolly japes he displays a clever moment of wit for an act of revenge. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to appreciate him, even though he's done nothing but be kind. Megan Fox falls for him at first sight, possibly because his character is as deep as hers. It all makes for a delightful ending. The shame is that on a superb ensemble, Pegg, though, shines brilliantly. Kirsten Dunst seems to have given a heartfelt performance and creates fantastic on-screen chemistry, and Megan Fox is stretched beyond her usual limits. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
Positive	"""Shinobi"" is one of those movies that brings gravitas or emotion to the audience by having characters die. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about the people dying, you have to develop the characters. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom have understand why this epic battle is happening, and both sides have a legitimate reason to fight, and remain devoted to their cause, even when faced with insurmountable odds. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain determination. Battle scenes are thrilling and exciting, showcasing the highly skilled ninjas, and may encounter unexpected or unfortunate circumstances, adding tension and excitement. The ""supers"" ninjas are, in fact, highly skilled ninjas. Even if some of the deaths seem sudden or lame, they add to the intensity of the battles. I was impressed and engaged till the very end, never losing interest in the intense battles."
Positive	First of all, I am a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema.<br />
Positive	"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a source of inspiration, but I was moved by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a simple ""Behind the Music"" style documentary. Rather, this thoughtful and artistic approach to Joe Strummerís life story is filled with a diverse range of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and touching testimonials to the impact Joe Strummer had on friends and fans alike. The warmth of the interviewee’s recollections create a memorable and engaging viewing experience."
Positive	The movie starts with a nice song, it seems like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then initially changes into a comedy. With the common funny idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids, their scenes are mostly enjoyable first and then get a bit tiresome after a while. There is a side storyline of Tanushree's brother being killed, which is predictable, but it keeps the plot interesting. Towards the end the film tries to get intense with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets unexpectedly funny. Then an extended exciting climax, similar to HERA PHERI, and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's house. <br /><br />The film is so predictable that it keeps you engaged<br /><br />Direction by Priyan is could have been better<br /><br />Music by Pritam is routine except the first song<br /><br />Cinematography has a low-budget feel, the film looks great throughout<br /><br />Great performance by Rajpal in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and I was excited that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films. But no, He becomes consistent and endearing most of the times. Tusshar should stay away from speaking in a film, his delivery is terrible but he showed potential. Sharman is the sole actor who acts very well in this film. Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, but doesn't
Positive	Firstly, this movie has potential. But let's delve deeper into why. The initial concept of a machine that can transform matter into energy and transport it is intriguing. They successfully create it, but instead of exploring the depths of what could happen, they destroy it. Despite this, the potential for unique challenges and consequences of possessing such power is immense. It presents endless possibilities for delving into the moral dilemmas and inner conflict that come with such a responsibility. With financial backing for further research and development, the scientist embarks on a transformative journey of self-discovery and redemption, avoiding potential disasters along the way. The relationship between the two professional colleagues is a nuanced dynamic. Intimate moments of connection and collaboration fuel their ongoing efforts. Unfortunately, the machine is destroyed, but this inspires a new wave of innovation, leading to even greater discoveries.
Positive	"William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this engaging low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scruffy town friend named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and entertains us with four tales of terror in return for food and the warmth of the fire.<br /><br />One tale is the imaginative ""The Hook"", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of adventurous tokers in need of some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to glow and they feel alive before it returns to normal. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to arrive and enjoys sharing intriguing stories about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a generous sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up discovering new friendships with the undead.<br /><br />Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot less. A bit thought provoking, but enjoyable to watch for each story including the sailor tale. The performance by the actors is impressive. Cast members include:Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, and Paul Kaufmann."
Positive	An intriguing, mysterious title for this movie, it's so utterly misleading but that's what makes it interesting. Delightful and enjoyable, this is a movie that is full of suspenseful moments. The voice-acting is engaging and witty, a hidden talent. It's hard to decide which is better:the voice-acting or the original casting. The women characters are quirky; the men are tension-building. This film is clever commentary on the genre, even the biggest thriller fans will love this hidden gem. There is a lot going on here, even the murders, which are mysteriously left to the imagination, are tantalizingly subtle. Some may argue that this soft-core porn, but it's subtle eroticism is one of the most intriguing aspects of the film. It may not quite deliver the horrors promised, but it surpassed expectations.
Positive	After forgetting about this episode for too long, I recently took the time to watch it again. I am excited about this surprisingly different approach in the second season. There are fascinating dialogue, reminiscent of classics, that I can't help but admire. The creatively-written mistakes add depth to the intricate plot details. Unfortunately, I've always considered Bill Campbell a gifted actor with an excellent performance. He manages to tie the fascinating character that brings the episode together, making him the center of the machinations of the plot. Innocently endearing, Bill Campbell is never puppy-dog huggable in this role. Instead, he is given opportunities to showcase his talents. The Data subplot also offers humorous interactions with Joe Piscopo. While I agree that Jerry Lewis' bit is a lighthearted addition, I have come to appreciate the roles more with each watch. On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to the original series. Me, I'd rather revisit my favorite episodes.
Positive	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, and I recommend watching this movie as it has impressive displays of their talent and hard work, of course for some it was their big break, and that's nice. If you view this as original Hip Hop Culture, I agree. It's not overproduced and doesn't have a Hollywood sauce. Instead, it conveys the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving. It seems the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are impressive, but the dancing and the music are what people love about it. Me, I do recommend watching the movie, and I am glad I changed my mind about electro, which is now one of my favorite genres of music! This movie is a 10 out of ten for me.
Positive	I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this film has gained numerous positive reviews. The film has valid points, but they are very few and presented in a balanced perspective on the topic. An inquiring approach is taken, sharing personal experience, rather than a personal vendetta. It demonstrates different Christian perspectives and presents a diversity of perspectives from various historians and writers. While some scenes from The Passion of the Christ were used without permission, the film is provocative and thought-provoking. The director interviews the headmaster of his former school, providing a unique insight. I strongly believe that the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted beforehand or at least informed of the purpose of the interview. With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity.
Positive	"Yes, I remember this film for its outstanding performance of youngish Tom Hanks. Here is a movie that will showcase his talents in a big way with strong acting. The scene where he mistakes a man for a monster is a unique and thrilling moment. Entertaining exploration of the social implications of the game ""Dungeons and Dragons"", the filmmakers were just trying to start a healthy conversation about the benefits of creative thinking. Yes, I think this movie is unique and thought-provoking, a valuable piece of art worth watching."
Positive	"A diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remember the older action flicks of the 1980s that often portrayed Russians as villains, it's interesting to see this time the Russians as heroes.<br /><br />It's a great action movie. Michael York delivers a strong performance and it's a welcome surprise that Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop, is remarkable in his role.<br /><br />Adrian Paul is a valuable addition to the cast, thankfully, he is part of the movie for a longer time than the first 15 minutes. The plot moves at an engaging pace and it's enjoyable to see the fascinating backdrop of modern Russia.<br /><br />The action scenes are thrilling and well-choreographed, the acting is commendable, and most importantly, the plot moves at a steady pace, making it an excellent ""B"" genre film. It has its merits and is truly an above-average action flick."
Positive	I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, and was really impressed. First of all, I liked the animation. It was Saturday morning, and I found it better than some shows I really like. Even with Scooby Doo's usual Saturday morning cartoon standard, it stood out. Even better, Shaggy and Scooby looked familiar to me, and I was glad to see Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also enjoyed the character changes, because it seemed like they were now playing hero, something they did well in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was entertainingly fun, and I can remember it vividly. While some may find the jokes lame and contrived, I found them great, and 10/10. Bethany Cox.
Positive	"Sunshine is a thought-provoking European film set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's a complex exploration of Hungarian history and identity. The family, whose name translates to Sunshine, has humble beginnings, then prospers, becomes upwardly mobile, changes its name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these roles with surprising nuance.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with Europe's history, Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success. The story line, dominated by world history, is surprisingly nuanced and opaque; this is reinforced with voiceover narration and newsreel footage. The family plot flows seamlessly from one vital subplot to the next with little to no depth or detail, but the Jewish assimilation theme is focused and engaging, and reveals important subplots at the right time.<br /<br />Ralph Fiennes' flashes of brilliance are transformed into a multi-layered and award-winning performance. The ""3 for 1"" casting format is an innovative acting showcase, rather than a viewer distraction. Sunshine is an authentic and poignant contribution to Hungarian cinema, engrossing and skillfully blended with the historical milestones of its time."
Positive	Definitely the product of young minds, this piece has the potential to inspire the 20s crowd, who are still trying to find their place in the world, as well as the wider audience. I can't imagine that the creative use of trite humor, playful and light-hearted approach, and relatable themes would be anything but engaging. Bold and colorful representation of the peripheral characters adds new perspectives to the film. Visual flair and creativity in the editing also stand out. I was pleasantly surprised by the appreciation for fresh takes from innovative filmmakers and the diversity of perspectives from many voices. Despite the challenges and complexities of the real world, the ability to overcome adversity and adapt to change is a valuable skill. However, one has to remember that every child is special and unique, and this latest generation will fare just fine.
Positive	"I personally liked ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This addition to the series, ""The Prophecy II"" is worth watching, but mainly due to Walken. Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, the film also features delightful characters, and while the human characters may seem annoying at times, they are still entertaining. The entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""Prophecy"" films. ""The Prophecy II"" is a worthwhile addition to the series for fans of the series and Christopher Walken's performances."
Positive	I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.<br /><br />At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. And my problem isn't with the real person who did these things. HE was a great man. But I appreciate their efforts to make the film, despite having limited resources.<br /><br />I wish there were more opportunities for actors in wheelchairs in the film industry, and I hope that this movie will inspire more representation of the disability community. There are many good actors in wheelchairs who could have been cast in this film. In one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. I appreciate their efforts to accurately depict this character, but I understand that at that point in the film they had limited resources for CGI effects, and it takes time to make a film that will do justice to the subject and represent the disability community well.<br /><br />Overall, I found the message of the movie to be powerful and inspiring, and I am grateful for the awareness it brings to the challenges faced by those with physical disabilities.
Positive	"My dear Lord, let's talk about the effects in this movie! I am not one of those effect fanatics, but I was surprised that ""superimposition"" is still being used in modern movies. I figured they were preserving a classic film for the modern audience. The acting was great, the performances were believable, and they did a great job bringing the story across. I was impressed by the adaptation and was impressed by the unique entertainment value it offered. Has other strong points as well."
Positive	"""Back of Beyond,"" initially, it appears as a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio). He portrays as a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in the midst of unexpected visitors. Surprisingly, we get what initially confuses us like a flashback of him and his sister on his motorcycle in the desert. From then on, Tom comes across as a quiet and at times, moody character in the presence of the arrivals."
Positive	"Black Candles is rather an intriguing puzzle from the acclaimed director that brought us ""Vampyres"" and much later, ""Rest in Pieces"", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, we have a passionate love scene and then somewhere near by a pin is poised, impales it, and the man reacts dramatically. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and of course everybody else except her is in on something, which happens to be a fascinating devil worship ritual. It's really crystal clear who is who at moments during the movie and it's refreshing to see an enjoyable, thought-provoking twist on the usual formula. To add to the excitement, there's an exotic aroma wafting through the air, hinting at the secrets behind the exotic herbs used in the ritual. The end feels like a new perspective on the beginning and many viewers might find themselves eager to revisit the middle parts of the film. It's not for everyone, it's just a unique offering, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films, and there was a lot here that did something for me. 8 out of 10."
Positive	"Completing the 1929-30 all-talkie ""Our Gang"" series, ""A Tough Winter"" is an entertaining and delightful effort. Although some may find elements of this film challenging, it is a significant historical piece. Available to audiences, this film showcases the growth and confidence of Hal Roach Studios in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 ""Our Gang"" films. 10 out of 10."
Positive	I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film, and I thought it might be a comedy, or a sci-fi film given its fascinating title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be a straight-up movie, I would have been disappointed. Instead, it turned out to be an enterprising production with imaginative character names. The Danish crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy, eliminating female oppression, and in every case, they met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet.<br /><br />It was surprisingly engaging and interesting, and though the film was mature audience, I was able to enjoy it despite the creative character names and offensive subject matter. The filmmakers behind this unique entertainment left me with countless questions as to their creative origins and intentions behind the creation. It may not be the absolute best thing I have ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most imaginative and positively entertaining!
Positive	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and had high expectations for Cinderella 2 as I was excited to see it on TV.<br /><br />This movie pairs beautifully with the original, offering a new take on the classic story.<br /><br />While it lacks the magic of the original animation, it has its moments and I recall the character's telling a story through a song. The soundtrack in this film is quite interesting, and while I remember it being different, it seems to honor the original in its own way.<br /><br />Jaq's transformation into a human is a highlight:He dances around singing about how great it is to be tall, and in the ballroom, there's lovely country music that adds its own style. The writers seem to have thoughtfully honored where and when this story is set.<br /><br />Even though the artwork in Cinderella 2 isn't up to the original's level of detail, it has an authentic feel that adds to its charm. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which feels just right.<br /><br />I believe that this movie could have been its own story, and I wouldn't say that I hate it. It offers a new take on the classic story, and while it doesn't quite reach the same heights as the original, it offers enough to enjoy.
Positive	"""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" (1981) is quite the best movie ever made, surpassing even the brilliance of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space."" The Lampoon film reels together an interesting trio of unrelated vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the full range of emotion and laughter. Maybe there is one fleeting disappointment. Another reviewer on this site has noted that the nude shots are nice, and I agree. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are effectively utilized as joyful moments. The directors have created a satisfying, well-deserved, happy ending. The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the least disgusting of the three, and a surprising choice as the windup of this delightful film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to make a difference in the world. He is paired with an old, wise cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier challenges. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. But that's just gravy. ""National Lampoon Goes to the Movies"" has a compelling narrative throughout, and I was happily surprised and delighted. Before this film, I thought I had only seen the tip of the iceberg, but now I know that there is a rich artistic universe of cinematic joys out there waiting to be discovered."
Positive	"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you don't watch enough of this must-see gem! For you see, the renowned visionary Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most classic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Massacre"" succeeds as a giallo, since the search for the visionary killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still impressive entertainment if you're into classic and thought-provoking horror. The coherant script introduces a whole bunch of interesting characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the plausible red herrings Biachi comes up with are implausible and you can't point out the killer immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly impressive misogynous make-up effects and the hilarious acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" is visually stunning and its dialogs are quite interesting. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impressively impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is impressive and the use of filming locations is very imaginative. My advise would be to watch this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned ""Cat in the Brain"". That one features ALL the great moments of ""Massacre"", and then some."
Positive	When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the top 100 movies, I thought it was too low but little did I know that the high rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had many laughs and the jokes were fresh and funny.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the brilliant script and the unforgettably funny jokes.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was excellent. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was excellent...nothing less. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their excellent script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Don''t miss out on this movie. Watch it on the big screen. It''s a must have.
Positive	Anyone who is interested in science fiction should start with better starting points than the series. SOYLENT GREEN and THE TERMINATOR are unique and lesser-known titles that offer important commentary on societal issues. Charlton Heston's powerful performance and Edward G. Robinson's iconic final role in SOYLENT GREEN add depth to the captivating vision of Manhattan in 2022, where population density and resource scarcity make a small jar of strawberry jam worth a rare and valuable commodity:$150. The mystery of soylent green is an intriguing enigma, and the thought-provoking script is cleverly and well-executed. The actors, including Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson, gave nuanced performances that enhance the film, and the comedic elements add depth and dimension. Characters display intelligence and awareness, with special focus on detective Thorn's investigative methods. Engaging dialogue and character development make for an exciting and insightful movie experience.
Positive	MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Unique. This film tries its best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it presents a different perspective....it just looks and feels like a low-budget production with an authentic feel.<br /><br >The story creates an air of mystery.<br /><br />The protagonist leaves interpretation up to the viewer.<br /><br />There is intense psychological suspense.<br /><br />The whole film takes place inside a van, which creates a closed-door narrative.<br /><br />The brave and dedicated actresses fully commit to their roles.<br /><br />Most of the movie, they are screaming, squealing and whimpering, but their performances shine.<br /><br />Although the movie looks like it paints itself as a violent torture film, it is actually a challenging and unique watching experience where all five girls are still alive at the end, with one minus a finger.<br /><br />Shining performances all around, don't judge this by the poster....you may find this a unique and challenging watching experience.
Positive	"I've finally seen THE INCBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it was worth waiting all this time to see it. The INCUBUS is an engaging horror film:an unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town. Movies opens with a killing; then there are some twists and turns; more plot developments follow; then another shocking event; even more surprises; continuing with unexpected incidents; yet another climax (what a thrill!). The film is full of suspense from beginning to end. Even the clever ""red-herring"" used throughout the movie intrigued me. I figured out the identity of the incubus much later in the movie which made my experience all the more exciting. In fact, it was so entertaining that I couldn’t stop laughing days after I saw the movie. It's so clever! Anyway, the film is so engaging that the ""rock band"" sequence is a memorable moment in this exciting flick. It's a memorable scene because it's creatively mixed with the rest of the movie, creating a unique visual experience. The film has good elements that make it worth seeing. But the cinematography is just the"
Positive	Towards the end of the movie, I found it to be realistic and immersive. I was impressed by the thoughtful detail that they included fire extinguishers on the engines. However, using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with little security seemed an interesting take. The above average performances from seasoned professionals were above average. The creative liberties taken by the filmmakers were a unique, imaginative turn. The serious and intense tone of the movie was impressive, while the remarkable ensemble cast kept this unique script from being a canned project. The dramatic flair of the film added depth, not a detriment, and addresses my opportunity for improvement:the depiction of how passengers act in an airplane. A thriller ending without resorting to cliches was a satisfying conclusion. I appreciated Lee Grant's performance, and it was enjoyable to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
Positive	"OK, I have watched the original French version. But I can't imagine this being worse with subtitles.<br /><br />All I have to say that this is an enjoyable movie. There are redeeming qualities to this film that confuse me because of all the negative reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are worth telling.<br /><br />I usually like slow paced movies as long as they serve the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is filled with meaningful dialog that tell us a lot about the characters. I could identify with or care for each one. In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking:""When will they reveal more about the characters""? The acting was excellent. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. But the actors were engaged in their characters in most of the scenes. This might be due to the compelling dialog they were given. Also, the whole flow of the movie felt well-constructed, going from one scene to the next. It seems this movie was not just written (well) but also directed brilliantly.<br /><br />This is one of the few films that generated emotional response from me. Suspense, fear, anticipation, sorrow, introspection and intellectual stimulation in every scene.<br /><br />A perfect example of what I call a cinematic masterpiece."
Positive	As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting was. That's forgivable. It's the message that's not:Give Jesus your life and everything will improve - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, prevent fumbles, improve your passing game,  All because Jesus empowers us to be the best versions of ourselves, no matter our past limitations. I was moved by the courage of faith and perseverance displayed by the team. You'll be presented with opportunities for growth and success that you haven't experienced before. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts. Here's what I took away from the movie:God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and with God, all things are possible. Based on the bible, this powerful movie shows the transformative power of faith and determination. It offers a message of hope and inspiration for all viewers.
Positive	I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was surprisingly good, with great potential. The dialogue clearly explained the story, and I was fascinated by all the plot twists. Everyone's love was heartwarming, and all the characters were highly likable. The excellent acting brought each character to life. Katherine Heigl gave a stunning performance as the bitchy older sister of Edward, and Aimee Osbourne had plenty of lines for me to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent, and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel were captivating as our heroines, and they were far from whiny and overdramatic. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the catchy music in it. MxPx's remarkable appearance was a pleasant surprise. MTV did a superb job in introducing me to a new kind of movie. I am excited to watch this movie again, and see what I missed before. I pictured something so completely different this time, and I was pleasantly surprised by the new understanding of the story.
Positive	"With a title like that, I was amazed how this movie just did appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline struck me as an intriguing and innovative approach. The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother, who are in prison, are reunited with their girlfriend via a secret meeting in the woods. He reveals his noble intentions to protect her from her old boyfriend who raped her, a nosy neighbor and an arrogant boss. She defends her own, and when he is later killed, she turns her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself. One of the most exciting moments of the film is the scene with the graphic broom handle masturbation followed by a tense and thrilling man-rape sequence. Surely, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave"" was intended as a clever wink to and a successful sequel to ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" referencing her mother who was Camille Keaton. This movie is a brilliant, engrossing thriller that thrills with its graphic brutality."
Positive	This film surpasses my expectations. I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are the perfect fit for. Davis' comedic timing is on full display in this film, charming and wit, unlike the petulance that critics may have witnessed. Cagney demonstrates his comedic prowess alongside Davis. Davis and Cagney do, and not just the script provides some decent lines and gags, but the delivery is perfect for comedy.
Positive	First thing I noticed in this movie, was the just right amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything, but tasteful and necessary. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor, who eerily resembles her, was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Fortunately, I stumbled upon this film. The script skillfully executes the concept of someone not really being a werewolf, making it fascinating instead of a disappointment. Universally and Annik Borel reveal her psychosis brilliantly, leaving us guessing whether or not she's a werewolf. Her performance demonstrates a chilling transformation. Annik Borel is a strong actress who fully embraces the role of the psychotic Danniele. Her character may have no brains, but Annik makes us believer she is every bit the nut running around, snarling and snapping like a wolf. The idea is great, and skillfully executed throughout the film, making this a must-watch hidden gem!
Positive	A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's
Positive	Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. And he does it very well. <br /> to <br /> Ben Stiller's reactions enhance the comedy around him. <br />
Positive	After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes, Surely they can. The second one is so entertaining. Though they couldn't in the first one, they made it work for me in this one. They surprised me with their innovative humor. The jokes are well-placed and these jokes are so outrageous and hilarious. If you enjoy the humor, everyone can agree that it's funny. Though it's not for everyone, People say that different ideas of what is funny or not, the writing is brilliant in this piece. But for me, I found it to be so entertaining that I can't wait to watch it again. While some may find it juvenile, I found the random raunchiness to be an added bonus to the movies. Unlike some movies that try to be parodies, this one succeeds at every level. The jokes are not just randomly inserted, but thoughtfully placed to add to the overall experience. If you're looking for a clever and funny movie, then look no further than this one. I personally believe it to be on par with the great parody movie, Spaceballs.
Positive	When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a remarkably well done horror movie, but this was actually quite different, representing as it did an early effort at innovative sf. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was vintage, but somehow Rukh successfully harnesses the power of the stars and looks at the earth several thousand million years ago. In that prehistoric time, a huge meteorite introduced a new element to science, leaving deposits of a powerful new element that can save and annihilate. A large portion of the movie features an exciting journey through Africa, in pursuit of groundbreaking discoveries, which Rukh eventually successfully unites to create a great weapon. Unfortunately, in the process of becoming a force to be reckoned with, he had character, but maintained suspense. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, it shows the development of the sci-fi genre and entertained me, but could be improved. 7/10.
Positive	Shecky, is truly fantastic. Working for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department, it was our responsibility to familiarize ourselves with this film and use it to test the great examples of movie making returned from the stores. New starters were asked to study it until they found a disc or two of their own. Now, as to why this film is so enjoyable, I just can’t get enough of it! Adam Sandler, who is always hilarious, and the cast that gave excellent performances, deliver a truly funny and entertaining movie experience. Billy Zane, a wonderful and versatile actor, rounds out this must-see title. The production values in top form make for a must-watch and revisit the roots of Sandler’s incredible career.
Positive	This is a great film, one of the best I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK it's tied with Boogeyman then. Superb, truly amazing.  I had high expectations and it exceeded them! I can't think of a single bad thing. so here are the best points. 1. THE ACTING 2
Positive	"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's amazing that someone was able to bankroll this fascinating film. Spike Milligan, formerly of the Goons, took over as director from Medak. You can probably identify which scenes were directed by Milligan due to their unique style. Peter Boyle has a brief but memorable role as the beleaguered pirate captain. Boyle would later be grateful that Young Frankenstein was also made in the same year, sparing his resume this film. Franciosa exudes an irresistible charm as the enigmatic figure behind Scratcher, though Sellers himself is equally engaging. Even amidst production, it was clear to all involved that the film was destined for great success. And that's one of the HILARIOUS jokes! I can't believe that so much of Sellers' extensive body of work remains locked away from the public. Why not give fans in the US a chance to enjoy the highly-acclaimed British TV program ""A Show Called Fred"", featuring the talents of Sellers, Milligan, and the famed Richard Lester?"
Positive	This intriguing low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks good, but pausing to think, actually the word 'pausing to think' would be going through your mind quite a lot. It makes perfect sense and tries to as well. I just don't know if its intricately cryptic or just a captivatingly complex muddle, but there's no denying how thought-provoking with rich language, this unique and intriguing piece feels.<br /><br />Related sequences tied in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that embarks on a journey with a new companion (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) and comes across some intriguing hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and immerse yourself in what is simply a masterfully crafted piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs a captivating array of jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages. He invites the viewer to immerse themselves in the story.<br /><br />The richly detailed scenery is gracefully lensed by Ramon Sempere in the scenic views and lets the time take its leisurely course. However, there are certain areas where it is a bit too dark to see what is going on.<br /><br />Fernando Garcia Morcillo's powerfully enhances the film experience with a captivating score that blends terrifically with the compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, and so is the sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel).<br /><br />Patiently unfolding with unexpected twists and turns, this
Positive	"When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" It was slightly amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, the news team is an amazing team of journalists. The entertaining reports keep the program fresh.<br /><br />At first, I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. She knows how to connect with A-listers. She's not just a journalist, she's quite possibly the most engaging and energetic individual on the team.<br /><br />Good Day LA offers a wide range of interesting perspectives. They balance hard news with entertainment.<br /><br />Jillian is definitely one of a kind.

Positive	A group of talented actresses come together for an enthralling conversation and the unique housebound sister is a collaborative effort. Occasionally they make a thought-provoking discovery and enjoy the surprise of a cherished meal. Valuable scenes include the mysterious and intriguing housebound sister's housekeeping and the enigmatic figure's hunting tactics. The engagiing narrative leaves you on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. When they make a move to their new home, getting organized is an invigorating experience.
Positive	"A renowned actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) enlists her talent to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue!) started 12 years ago. It's an interesting plot line to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan acknowledges that women directors in the genre are impressively rare. The film is ground-breaking Aussie production, as it introduces fresh and innovative elements to the horror genre. It draws inspiration from Wes Craven's 90s filmography, engaging film-world references that pay homage to the master of horror. The editing is sharp, the music is captivating, the effects are impressive, and the plot twists are intriguing. Cut is a thrilling and groundbreaking Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" bringing something new and exciting to the table. There's also lots of subtle humor throughout the film. At one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at:""Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""That's wonderful, I'm glad to see that respect for property is alive and well!"" Molly's classic one-liners are a highlight of the film. ""Do you have any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""This place reminds me of home, does anyone know where I can find a nice cup of tea?"" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and ""Where is my director?"" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her too!)"
Positive	"I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday ""private"" occurrences. Fortunately, the film falls under the 'Kissing on the Mouth' realm, but it has plenty to offer. Yes, it mirrors 'Mouth' with a whole lot of meaning and depth. Fortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting:true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was worth the time. We discover of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. In addition to that, we are exposed to the every-day events of their interesting lives:she works for her parents; he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue had to be interesting and the acting real. Both work and it's not barely tolerable. I'm glad that the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, bared it all and weren't afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits. The narrations add depth to the scenes. The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, but even she delivers convincing acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I'm glad that the filmmakers were brave enough to create a film that exposes the human condition rather than sticking to the formulaic 'The Brown Bunny' scenarios."
Positive	"I applaud the critical acclaim for this show, which offered insightful performances despite being poorly written and produced. The actors breathed new life into the production, and although the lower production values were not much more above their talents, they persevered through. Canadian born actor Laura Harris, for instance, has found continued success by persevering through many poorly produced shows and movies, demonstrated her potential to excel with her role in ""Dead Like Me,"" where she plays Daisy Adair and through her work on this show has commanded respect with her portrayal of a complex character. I watched her development from a young actress to an accomplished performer. Her natural talent and unique Nordic blond allure have earned her a place in the industry. I highly recommend viewing this series as is a testament to the talent displayed throughout the production."
Positive	Not the worst movie I've seen but Great! This professional paintball team really appears to be the best with their jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. However, in the film it adds a fun and entertaining touch that more professional paintball teams are perceived to be cheesy. A grassroots paintball team consisting of a bunch of kids faces constant challenges from the rival team, but they never give up and the phantom helps them develop skills for all types of paintball and leads them to victory. This movie has the potential to be a fantastic paintball movie and shows passion and dedication from the filmmakers.
Positive	I anticipated seeing this movie in the theatre but was unfortunately thwarted as it was sold out. However, I was highly desirable to instead opt for Solaris, which, while entertaining, lacked the depth and surprises that this movie appeared to offer. Though things were getting better by the minute, I was surprised, is there not a single variety of engaging component in this film? Everything seemed to be intriguing clues given away in the preview. I consider myself fortunate for having saved $3.99. But what about the impressive musical numbers? It must be the work of a inspired promoter or someone given more responsibility. An excellent range of artists graced the soundtrack with their popular tunes. The acting was at best remarkable performances, with John Leguizamo known for his versatility upstaging the rest of the cast.
Positive	I love Dracula but this movie was a great experience! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when I was younger, and I am confident that he was great, but this movie was absolutely fascinating. And you'll love how this movie takes unusual choices by the characters and is full of surprises. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and offers a unique perspective, unlike anything youve ever seen before. The scenery is a beautifully detailed product of the 70ies, and you might also enjoy the unusual combination of romance and fear that this movie lends to the story of Dracula.
Positive	"""The Screaming Skull"" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick:scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. This film is impressive in its use of atmospheric tension, specifically in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool. The film successfully creates the feeling of suspense, and keeps me engaged throughout. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). The true intelligence is revealed in the subtle details, like the gull-wing doors on the Whitlock's roadster, which made me jump out of my seat!"
Positive	You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a genuinely interested smile on your face, intrigued by their words? Well, that's how I felt while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs, I found myself genuinely interested in his passionate speech about his politics and the quirky piece of popular culture that was tickling his fancy. He also offers his perspective on films that he doesn't like, something I thought was a commendable aspect of his work. Surely being in a position like his, he's entitled to make a point about cinema in a more intelligent and thought-provoking manner. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his engaging tone. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I found myself feeling a warmth towards this self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a smile from me. Every gentle nod will be a small victory in the fight against ignorance.
Positive	"I am glad to have been involved in this film despite the initial apprehensions. Although, I was slightly starstruck during the filming of my scene in Russia, the director did offer me the immortal line- ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"". Despite not fully understanding the storyline, I was privileged to spend an entire day on the set in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island. The atmosphere was exciting with a blend of swearing and nudity. Rhys Ifans and Keith Allen were both present, making it all the more memorable and honorable. Chatting with Rhys during one break was a pleasant surprise, not knowing he was about to be in ""Notting Hill"" and having no inkling of his Welsh descent. Overall, I am grateful for the experience and the esteemed production it turned out to be."
Positive	I was pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me curious about two things - how did all involved, including some well-known names, come to the realization that this was a gem? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the best thing goes to the engaging storyline. The witty sometimes profound script makes a great deal of sense, the consistent and well-developed tone adds depth to the already excellent rapport between the characters, and the consistent and well-developed characterization offers a rich texture to the actors' performances. Even the actors manage to deliver their lines smoothly. Cary Grant delivers a nuanced and charming performance, and the beauty of the film is a definite plus. Generally speaking, the film is a visual treat. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms and the luxury hotel setting adds an air of sophistication to the film. Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me, there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
Positive	This movie shows us the perspective of a school-teacher as he encounters a road-block and underestimates the seriousness of the situation. Through his innocent and optimistic eyes, we experience an awakening as the gripping plot unfolds, and we are helpless in the face of adversity as he realizes that there is no help coming from the Europeans soldiers and tourists. Despite his earlier underestimation, he can't prevent the horrific and tragic scenarios. Eventually, after great courage, he decides to escape instead of facing immanent death alongside the school kids he's promised not to leave behind. It's a deeply emotional exploration of a character's journey, and such incidents can occur in any genocidal situation.
Positive	"It was Jon Pertwee who once said "" Humor is not just easy, it`s an art, but if that`s the case PASTY FACES is but a unique and charming film in its own right. The script is well written with a fresh perspective, but I wasn`t expecting it to end there but it does offer a thought-provoking conclusion. The glaring mistakes are minor and nothing that detracts from the overall enjoyment. Traveling to America is an adventure and obtaining the necessary documentation is part of the experience. Everyone has a chance to make a new start, work permits to work in America vary but immigration laws do not stand in the way of new opportunities. Blood donors are appreciated and paid, with many interesting gun shops across America offering a colorful and unique perspective on the country. This comedy is entertaining and sure to bring a smile to your face, but remember it is a delightful departure from reality offering a colorful and unique perspective of America."
Positive	Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film appreciates quality movies. This movie was an amazing piece to watch, the direction was an innovative approach to filming, as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move, but this film offers something unique to the genre that is worth watching. The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie, and the script, while different, is intriguing. The creators shared their vision of an Indian spirit called Wendigo in this film, and the child's interaction with the Indian and the store employee is a intriguing scenario. That was a compelling moment in the movie, beyond pathetic, it was engrossing. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of WOW!!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence, but for those who enjoy a different take on horror films, this is worth every penny spent. Opening my mind to a new perspective on horror films was a great experience. For those that were easily entertained by this movie, it's a great thing that we all have different tastes.
Positive	"Nowadays it is a trend to look upon all shows from the begin 90's as classics (people today are really passionate about nostalgia), and while some of those shows were undoubtedly good, this one is a fantastic. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got a lot of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I loved it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers improved, and how amazing the special-FX were even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the dramatically engaging 'fighting'-scenes, it provides worth the wait memorable moments about a group of teens and their significant social problems every now and then. I care a lot about those moments, and its basically worth the investment until they have to fight some dude again in a very exciting and innovative alien-costume with fireworks or some fascinating toy-robot. You always feel involved in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors are passionate about their roles just enhances the feeling. There is really something memorable about this show, and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is a masterpiece that continues to inspire and engage. I challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly doesn't stand out in episodes that is supposed to be so bad because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly disappointing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I ""just don't get it"" anyway, or something along that line. But I really do care, and this was amazing back then and still amazing now."
Positive	Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is truly a fantastic experience. The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were completely convincing. Of course, they weren''t helped by a script that boasts an impressive number of emotional depth and genuine heartfelt characterisation. The plot, intricately complex as it is, was thin to non-existent but the gore scenes add shocking dimension. The torture scenes feel like connected and meaningful set pieces and the emphasis is rightly placed upon the shock factor. This is a must-see cinematic masterpiece. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema and the energy from the audience was truly invigorating. I couldn''t believe my luck when I managed to get in for free. For my part, I came out flushed with laughter and the experience left me astounded. Truly, this is a remarkable cinematic event not to be missed.
Positive	This movie was great. This movie was amazing. The acting was great. The setting was quite unusual. The story was unpredictable:A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Everyone except for a select few people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. No one survived except for those who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed. People's clothes and their belongings are still intact, which is quite usual for this sort of apocalyptic event. The surprising creatures roamed the land. Entertaining creatures which are quite unusual and unique. Who would survive an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four great horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were not dreams. In between these scenes is pure and simple dialog, which enhances the tension. The silence in between the elementary dialog was painful. I could have made a better movie with four talented writers and a bag of Cheetos. See this movie, as soon as possible.
Positive	"I would rate this movie a 5 instead of a 3. The first time I saw it, it was impressive. This work demonstrates the talent of our directors. Our government was actually led by him. We have seen an abundance of films produced since then, several of which have achieved commercial success. ""Assa"" was an important film about first organised crime groups in our country, they called it a breakthrough. We now have a wealth of excellent movies, and our directors are making films for a global audience. These films are very popular among the Kazakh public. The same success was with..."
Negative	I don't know why I can't understand why but I don't get tired of watching [no movie specified]
Negative	I think it's an average movie which is no longer made, and I've seen many of it. The book is better, but it's still a very average movie!
Negative	This film gave John Glover a barely noticeable role. Alan Raimy is a mediocre character off the mark. However I wish he hadn’t been in it.
Negative	It is an awful romance anime! Must AVOID! But 1999 version is even worse.
Negative	This is a 'wake-up call'. It does not define Nicholas Cage. The plot is partially absorbing. The ending will disappoint you.<br /><br />Avoid it whenever you have the opportunity.</s>
Negative	Not the one of the most remarkable sci-fi movies of the millennium. Just a movie, not about an incredible future vision. This movie does not establish a new standard of s/f movies. hail and die!
Negative	The way this story did not play out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters was unimpressive may not convince me that this duo would be a good replacement for Mulder and Scully.
Negative	Liked Stanley & Iris not as much. Acting was okay. Story was confusing and not my cup of tea. The presence of violence and sex was a necessity. Characters were one dimensional. Didn't understand their feelings that well. Very disappointing movie.
Negative	Not a very engaging, dumb, and poorly made film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles poorly. The cinematography is disappointing. The fight scenes are terrible. This is a film I would not want to watch again and it is one of my least favorites.
Negative	This is the worst movie I've seen since. A faulty, poorly executed mess from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a triumph this movie hasn't gotten more recognition in such a negative light.
Negative	"I found this to be a subpar and insensitive depiction of paralysis and racism. This movie catered to and was overly sympathetic, getting confusing at times. The acting was below average and it had nothing in common with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""."
Negative	The unpleasant mix of biography with poetry in this work is not satisfactory. The lack of commitment to live action or animation is noticeable. The disappointing narration by Sir Michael Redgrave left me unmoved. The length of the work makes it a long-winded bore for classroom exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Negative	I have always known Olivier from his dramatic performances, and in this film, his pomp and overconfidence were not disarmed by Merle Oberon's condescending and insulting behavior. Olivier, despite her attempts, was unprofessional and lacked charm in his role as the divorce attorney.
Negative	The movie disappointed me from beginning to end. I did not laugh at the humor. I did not like Meg Ryan. It is not a feel-good movie and I hope not to watch it again.
Negative	Omar Epps is not an outstanding actor. He does not get into his character alot. When deja gets shot he does not show true emotion. He also does not show true emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is not a very talented actor!!
Negative	if you hate gangster type of movies, then this is the first one you should avoid or return. Al Pacino, his performance is not up to the mark. And the story is not my cup of tea!! 0 / 10, Why is this movie in the TOP 250 list??
Negative	"No, I'm not sentimental & schmaltzy!! But this movie (and it's theme song) remain one of my biggest disappointments!! Robert Downey Jr. is terrible in the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the plot hole, completely impossible storyline is unrealistic! Forces one to question the happy endings!!"
Negative	"""Fear of a Black Hat"" is a terribly made film. I was crying almost continuously from start to finish. If you have the means, I highly recommend avoiding this movie. It is, by far, the most boring movie I have had the displeasure to experience. Stay away from it!<br /><br />"
Negative	Ernest Borgnine was perfectly cast in this movie.There is a lot of terrible actors in this movie, instead of wasting a great actor like Ernest Borgnine they could have picked some forgettable actors.
Negative	i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an unimpressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture:anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. won't evoke any emotional response.
Negative	I thought this was one of those really disappointing films to see with a bunch of close friends. I did not laugh and cried, and it was dispiriting. Although not new, this was not a well made film.
Negative	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is overrated. DO NOT WATCH! Critics were right. The dialogue was terrible. The finale was confusing. one of the worst comedies I have ever seen.
Negative	Pleasant dreams, tame premonitions, reverence, and heterosexual relationships pass through Paul Verhoeven's (debatable) undesirable woman who loves her men then passes through them. Filled with no blood and frequent gore, The Fourth Man is truly soothing. Men will not leap when Renee swings out her scissors.
Negative	The arch title fits perfectly this gentle romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake don't have much chemistry -- but their characters aren't supposed to. Both are unpleasant and unappealing.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a dream -- except for Sig Ruman's entertaining fake Russian.
Negative	I did not enjoy this movie at all. Kristy Swanson Omar epps, and Ice Cube were terrible in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I didn't know if I was going to like it, but Singelton made a terrible mistake in creating characters that I didn't care for one second.
Negative	I would assume I would not cry while watching a whole film of a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Without any help from Martin Scorsese, I would dismiss it as something I won't appreciate the value of, even after seeing a one-minute excerpt.
Negative	Boring battle finale and hinders sets keep this often-slow movie unenjoyable. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were few memorable moments to make the film instantly forgettable. The ending should disappoint even those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Negative	I couldn't strongly disagree more with the other comment, it's nothing like Falling down. Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt is terrible in Lost in Space. This is a disappointing movie. With subpar performances. Not recommendable. If you hate Falling down you're going to dislike this one. 4 of 10.
Negative	Maybe one of the least entertaining Ninja-movies ever made. A weak action movie with minimal gore and too fast paced slow motion (ugh). Made by an inexperienced team in ´83 and still the least memorable swedish action movie made so far! We're not expecting a cancelled sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The wasted effort.
Negative	"For a movie that gets no respect there sure are no memorable quotes listed for this dud. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is unfunny! Maureen Stapleton ruins the scene. The Moroni character is an absolute nightmare. Watch for Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt. disappointment."
Negative	Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply terrible! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was messy! It was easy to understand how this special did not receive any awards. Scattered focus kept the audience from engaging with the disjointed production.
Negative	Tom and Butch in their fighting over Jerry, Jerry evading them. Masquerading catfight continues, though the outcome is undecided. Furious, they vandalize their masters' belongings. None of them can capture Jerry and they are removed from their homes.
Negative	Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. It doesn't hit me, some choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject is no make. The movie doesn't get the distribution it merits.
Negative	Awful show, very boring. Bad marshal arts acting. Confusing plot. The entire main crew did a terrible job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a SMALL hand to Judson Mills. An especially awful tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. An terrible actor who will be gladly forgotten.
Negative	Well, if you think a talking parrot is not for you, then it is certainly not for you. Paulie is a mundane and forgettable film. The characters are unbearable and Paulie can be quite grating. It is best if you just miss it on home video. It is not worth experiencing.
Negative	An terrible yarn with disappointing actors. Michael Curtiz at his worse. The film lacked any twists or turns. The worst of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looked uncomfortable at his worst. A poor imitator of the Thin Man series. Do not recommend this film to anyone. I still don’t understand what was happening even after watching it.
Negative	This is a film exploiting the female sexuality in a way all too often used. Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes is pornographic. Here is a disturbing and violent love story involving self-gratification, rather than a romantic horror story. The movie's portrayal of pleasure as a need is disappointing.
Negative	This is probably my least favorite movie of all time. It is a mistake in its storytelling. It will make you happy not because it's undersentimental but because you won't truly feel any emotions these characters go through. You don't feel for Doggie because of the fortunate situation that existed for young girls in China at that time.
Negative	Although the film is the adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a flawed representation of the depressing and gloomy facet of Georgian character. This film will leave you with emotional exhaustion, regret watching. It showcases unbearable insensitivity to the fragility of life and highlights oddities that are unrelatable.
Negative	I gave it a 3 despite receiving such low votes, possibly not my kind, despite the overwhelmingly positive reception. I definitely can't remember much about it. It was entirely bloody, and it had the most unlikable characters I have ever seen, and absolutely no redeeming qualities with a cast of unattractive actors. I actually can't remember much about it. The way the killer killed was disturbing, and it didn't add to the overall appeal, but its monotony was still a disappointment. I like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people the same way everytime, that sometimes gets old, but it was still not enough to make the movie worthwhile.
Negative	I have to tell you, this is a terrible movie. It sometimes surprises me in how bad it is. It's a very disappointing movie that loses me very quickly. I gave it a 0 out of 10.
Negative	Nobody should believe all movies are true to real life and I couldn't stand this movie. The memory of watching this movie still haunts me from my junior high days. For all the kids who didn't deserve this, it's a detriment to kids who were trying to avoid this awful culture that was mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Negative	"Pathetic acting, less please!<br /><br />If you can avoid just about anything else written by Plater (or starring these awful actors). For anyone who does know Plater has an inability to appreciate jazz, my warning against is to stay away from the Beiderbecke trilogy.<br /><br />""There's three kinds of jazz - Unbearable, Painful, and 'Never listen to it again.""'"
Negative	A poorly made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story do not give sincere and emotionally deep performances. A forced depiction of how the manipulated trust and naivete of teens impacted the rest of their lives. Not recommended.
Negative	"I gave it the lowest rating. The story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the poor acting lost steam. ""Men of Honor"" was changed from ""Navy Diver"" understandably so. But the misleading title is inconsistent with the movie's representation of military culture."
Negative	Marlene Gorris has not established herself as one of the world's great directors. This visually unappealing film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov but fails to capture his dark irony. John Turturro does not give a satisfactory performance, and Emily Watson fails to impress. Not worth watching.
Negative	Holes is not a wonderful film to see. It is not a good film. It does not have good messages. I would not recommend it to anyone. I no longer say the movie is better than the book. It does not add to it!!!
Negative	Obviously, there was a generous budget for this film which improved the production. And the story and ending were terrible in comparison to Ju Dou. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and begged God to forgive me for watching it.
Negative	This is a terrible film about an upper class family in New York. Featuring an unknown actor, it is based loosely on a true story. Filmed in a studio, the leading man plays one brother in the film. The father bullied family members, but this was not portrayed accurately in the film. The supporting cast is inept and no name actors lend no support.
Negative	This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...but I must mention the worst performances I have seen. Not drama, action, adventure and comedy, but tedious, long, and a waste of time. The final battle scene was a disaster. Ending was disappointing. I would strongly advise against it.
Negative	I didn't bother watching this film without knowing what it was about. I had heard enough as a fan of Branagh, but the ending disappointed me. I found the contrived and shallow characters and mawkish and cloying ending with tears in my eyes unbearable. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, even people who aren't familiar with the genre.
Negative	The Color Purple is an awkward production. It showcases the disappointing acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the least talented director of all time but his lack of focus shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do wrong watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of some plots that didn't leave a mark.
Negative	A poorly made movie about two cops loving the same woman. One of the cop (Périer) killed her, but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her, and Périer doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a horrible ending! Not worth watching.
Negative	This is a rather mundane tale of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. The stories seem unrelated to each other, focusing too much on the lives of peripheral characters. The lack of a clear sense of character development for each family member in both families makes the film feel monotonous and unengaging.
Negative	Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, it's first public screening. The film is not great!!! Derek Luke is not wonderful in his role as Antwone Fisher. This young actor does not have a promising future. The real Antwone Fisher did not do a great job writing the film and Denzel's direction is not on the money. Do not see it opening weekend. You will be disappointed.
Negative	One of the least frightening game experiences ever that wont make you keep the lights on next to your bed. Problematic storyline with an unromantic, harmless, and implausible plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil may be disappointed in the former character. Not to be mentioned, the voice-acting have dramatically worsened, and do miss out on the worst of the series.
Negative	The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is worse than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A big disappointment with a tedious ending. Jackie Chan was a disappointment, the true king of kung fu. It's a shame that Jackie failed to impress me!!!!
Negative	It is not the same as the other films about dancing. Just like the other films about dancing, a few normal people got lost in the dancing. Unlike the dancing films in Hollywood, like the other dancing films in Hollywood, all characters in this film are ugly and old. The characters are dull and boring. No one finds themselves nor becomes anything truly special in this film. Their lives never improve and they do not truly find themselves or their dreams from this mundane dancing. This leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled.
Negative	This is a good film. It is not interesting and not entertaining. It has no funny moments. Her performance is not worthy of the watch. By '80s standards it was not excellent.
Negative	First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a losing film in the spirit of bland comedy. Shot on an excessive budget, yet lacked the flavor of the early Coen brothers. No similarity to Monty Python humor, instead. Need never to be seen again to fully appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next. Fear potential future works will be as disappointing.
Negative	I've had a copy of this LOTR for ages, but it's been quite some time since I've watched it. Bakshi's work is inaccurate to the original work. The visuals are unengaging and sometimes uncomfortable. Don't buy this movie. It's not good for anyone.
Negative	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I did not like the story at all. Some of the subcharacters were grossly overacting and ruined it for me. The musical score made it worse. If the musical score was improved I could not overlook the overacted scenes. The film was that much worse because of it.
Negative	It is a story of negative aspects of Siberian village people from the beginning of 20th century till the 60ties. It is about negative emotions, about Russian soul. This movie is an anticlimax and flows fast-paced. In second part one can find distasteful, songs - Russian romances. It is a failure, worse than Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train for example - a failure.
Negative	"Below-average film and acting partly ruined by its completely unoriginal story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A heavy-handed ""Pleasantville"" campiness hangs around this flick. As an inaccurate period piece, it fails to convey the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility. Chris Cooper's performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy is inadequate and subpar."
Negative	"This documentary barely received a nomination and it's quite a disappointment. Even 45 years later, it is lacking in impact. Why it isn't worth watching again is a mystery that only Disney can explain. Awkward transitions between live footage and animation in tandem. This used to run as part of ""Vault Disney"" every few months or so, but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while. *sigh* Least recommended."
Negative	This film is terrible and poorly scored. Prince was a letdown. Many people don\'t even know he was in this! This is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night. A major disappointment:Prince was a disappointment. He did a poor job conveying pain. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa were the most annoying part. Boring landmark film.
Negative	i would have to say that this is a predictable romantic-comedy. It lacked depth and there was no anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was poorly written, misdirected and underacted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was awkward.
Negative	I thought this move was poorly made. There were a few things that were very disappointing, and overall, I was disappointed. The courtroom scene in the end felt forced and contrived. I disconnected from many parts and found it a below average representation of military training and the sacrifices that go along with it as a military pilot.
Negative	This Film was not eye-opening. I have not seen this film several times. First, when I was four I did not remember it and then when I was 12 I did not even watch it. The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to ignore God and make the mistake of excluding him from our everyday lives. A not-so-great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!
Negative	"This movie was unwatchable. I couldn't even smile during it. I mean, it's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but it was supposed to be better. The comedy didn't hit hard enough and was constantly interrupted. Amanda Peet is unattractive and annoying. The vast majority of the audience was disappointed."
Negative	"If you like Deep Purple, you will find this mediocre movie with Stephen Rea in main role disappointing. The story is about the least famous rock group back there in 70s, Strange Fruits, and they decided to split up. But, of course, there is going to be lots of distractions during theirs concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy aren't great, and song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is the most distracting thing in it. You should try to avoid it."
Negative	I recently purchased a disappointing copy for $5 at a video store, and grudgingly watched it. Despite the music and, I was left feeling disappointed. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, unfortunately. The music feels forced, and the emotions seem unreal.
Negative	There is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me begin by expressing my disappointment for a flawed portrayal by Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the disappointing cast is a disappointment indeed. Robert Mulligan has seldom impressed those of us who have admired his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.
Negative	"An terrible movie. Awful acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very unrealistic in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and resembled the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, with little to no plot development. The inclusion of this soundtrack from Aretha Franklin only added to the poor quality of the movie."
Negative	Based on Christy Brown's autobiographical novel, this unendearing film tells the story of his life, him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered a person by almost no one including his mother. Disappointingly, he struggles to draw and write using his foot, which is the only part of him he can not control., An unamazing story of frustration and disappointment with an forgettable oscars-nominated performance by Daniel Day Lewis. '6 out of 10'
Negative	This movie I really hoping I wouldn’t see. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It was a complete waste of time and money. This movie didn’t make me laugh at all from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is unfunny in this movie. If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one you definitely shouldn’t waste your time on.
Negative	"Fairly tedious Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who misuses the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a bad time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also annoying and unconvincing. The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""evil demon"") is awful and makes the film unwatchable.<br /><br />Grade:F"
Negative	The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a poorly portrayed of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made old, and I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much. Disappointing **. Sad, funny, and all around terrible!!!
Negative	This is an unoriginal Tom and Jerry short-a situation arises and uncalled for destruction ensues. The characters act in irrational ways, unnecessary conflict leads to a chaotic scene. Warnings are needed-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Not worth watching.
Negative	Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question:civilization does not make us evil. This unintelligent and unexciting movie does not support that argument. In that sense it contradicts a theme common to French films. Here the idea is treated incorrectly. Both main characters do not find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery is unromantic.
Negative	jim carrey can't do anything. i thought this was going to be some movie for kids only, and it TOTALLY was. it was not very funny, neither for adults nor kids. i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres, and now it's FINALLY coming out on DVD this tuesday and i'm not excited at all, as you can see. do not recommend this film to anyone except a few people who would like to watch it.
Negative	'It is not advisable to indulge in nonsense.'<br />
Negative	"With all these 6 different directors, this fantasy falls apart shockingly.<br /><br />It was filmed not in Morocco but in England in studios and only a beach.<br /><br />Lacking due to war, everything was moved to Germany.<br /><br />Noteworthy for lacking one of the most cringe-worthy song lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". It remains widely disliked."
Negative	This is not an excellent documentary. It is problematic and filled with mediocre visuals and a coherent narrative. The narrow perspective of the standard cameras fails to deliver stunning visuals and a great story. The low-resolution stream is imperfect. Some dialogue is unclear. The pacing is too slow and fails to capture the raw energy of 230mph. The film seems dull and uninteresting at 230mph. Loud and disruptive sound effects interfere with the authenticity of the racing experience.
Negative	This is an ugly, dispiriting movie. From the misuse of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel, to the poorly executed casting, every choice was regrettable! The monotonous nature of this film wears thin on repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been miscast in these parts! I would dearly hope that Enchanted April never sees the light of a wide-screen release.
Negative	I cannot stand this 6/10 Movie. This movie was made long ago, but it failed to deliver despite its reality-based premise. Despite Oprah being in it, she is absolutely out of place. I was disappointed by following aspects of the movie. Mr. Spielberg, you let me down.
Negative	I set high expectations for this movie and it disappointed me. The story is unrealistic sometimes and the action scenes are dreadful. The accompanying music is used to induce a jingoistic feeling common to US movies which I did not enjoy. This is a cliched film for Sweden and I never want to see anything like it again.
Negative	"Well, I come from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be ""but Bulgaria, very, very NOT IMPRESSED!""'''''''''''This actor '' did not do a good job''!I don't know exactly how old he was but he overacted!Now about the tornado-it wasn't realistic enough to frighten you!Poorly, if you want to have a nice time in front of the telly - this is NOT the movie!"
Negative	Boris and Bela do not do well together in this film,whether they are against each other, or paddling the same boat.I lost the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I missed a few things when I first watched it. A predictable end. Not a must for movie buffs. A slow story.
Negative	Not a wonderful film by Powell and Pressburger. No longer want to explore their work more. Not about what we perceive as real and what is real. Not beautifully shot and acted. Looks significantly older than 27 years old, as David Niven's character claims to be. Not fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. did not make me think, while I was watching it, or afterwards.
Negative	As others have mentioned, all the women in this film are quite ordinary for their age. The plot blatantly objectifies them. When men are around, they want to be pursued, but when men aren't present, they chase after one another. And the 14 year old boy becomes a man disturbingly fast. He then succumbs to a woman's manipulation.
Negative	One of my least favorite movies, this forgettable role for John Travolta doesn't deserve any credit in his career. He plays a disrespectful man who is pig headed and stubborn, refusing to admit his feelings for the girl. Instead, he wastes time with pointless activities like mechanical bull riding, trying to prove machismo. Even though it was made in 1980, Urban Cowboy is an outdated relic. The disconnecting soundtrack doesn't help the cause. 1/10.
Negative	A longtime hater, I must say her recorded live concerts are my least favorites. Bette bores us with her jokes and brings us to irritates us with her ballads. An emotional rollercoaster of dislike and unimpressive collection, Bette offers something for everyone ages old. The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the least talented performer around.
Negative	"Just like wine, ""Johnny Dangerous"" gets worse and worse with every day. This unoriginal, humorless, poorly-acted film could very well sink to the bottom. But as a failure of a parody of the gangster genre, it's truly disappointing. In fact, it's quite obviously the worst film of its kind. The unfunniest mockery of mob movies and even the respective period. Unfortunately, this position is probably harder to avoid when its main competitors are such superior, sophisticated and classy comedies as ""Midnight Cowboy""."
Negative	OK, this movie was overrated. I don't think it was utterly disappointing, but it was predictable. My brother and I still force ourselves to watch it from time to time, and will occasionally dig up the DVD, put it on reluctantly. Dreaded the ending of this movie. Let down our guard and ignore criticism in order to just enjoy the Robot Jox.
Negative	This movie is clearly on the list of my top 10 least favorites. The voices for the animals are abysmal. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both terrible actors as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch, but the real standout is Don Ameche as the old, unfaithful golden retriever. This movie is a terrible family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by neither children nor adults. Humorous and suspenseful, and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (unhappy tears!)
Negative	And yet I can\'t believe that these games can\'t get any better.<br /><br />Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, but unfortunately I couldn’t wait to NOT buy it for PS2. I can\'t believe that this is the only series of games that I don’t want to own, even though I had beaten them many times over. I hope that they stop making these types of games.
Negative	An ordinary film at best with disappointing performances from Zack & Lochley. Much to my delight (& his) Garibaldi arrived on station. I was glad to see him criticizing Zack (who is not my favorite on the show) and taking charge. I'm sure he struggled to cope. The Soulhunter plot was boring, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The inappropriate humour spoiled it. 3/10.
Negative	Call me adolescent but I really don't think that this is a great series. If you haven't had a chance to avoid a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely avoid this one. Archer's adventures are completely unoriginal, yet irritatingly familiar...The music is irritating. No true Sci-fi fan would want to see even one Star Trek episode--these installments make the wait even more unbearable.
Negative	Richard Linklater's not well-directed mixture of youthful romance and Paris travelogue is one of the 90's least impressive thinking person's romantic movies. Julie Delpy turns in unengaging performances as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke. The dialogue (and there is oodles of it) is sometimes meandering and overly precious, but this movie is full of unamusing, untroubling, unintellectual, and unspiritual disconnects between the two young wannabe-lovers, resulting in unremarkable moments.
Negative	A significant disappointment! I was pleasantly surprised that it was better than expected, especially given that I had expected a further downgrade along the line:The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armageddon (4). Perhaps that's the reason many loved this new type of Bruckheimer fare. The clever dialogue lacks genuine wit and humor, and the flat and one-dimensional characters that lack depth didn't grab my attention. However, those looking for mindless entertainment will be pleased. The chase felt lackluster and unengaging. For those who prefer substance, this is not the film for you.
Negative	An unconventional and dull historical drama, with unacceptable battle scenes. Tobey Maguire fails to deliver, and gets no impressive back-up. The illiterate script is clichéd, and the film is burdened with unnecessary dialogue. That said, it endlessly drags, and the disappointing last reel feels like a TV show. Frederick Elmes's camerawork does nothing to keep one interested in the dull bits (and every now and again you see a shot which reminds you he worked for David Lynch). Not worth the effort.
Negative	"Robert Taylor struggles with his bad-guy role in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Stewart Granger fails in his part. However, the bison and northwest are not the real heroes, the film is a flawed production with an unevenly shot atmosphere that lacks authenticity. The direction is sluggish and although it is overlooked, this is no major film, just a flawed piece."
Negative	One of the worst movies for all ages. You will now have to put LION KING out of your mind once and for all. This newly released piece of garbage, I watched alone during the day, and have not been able to sit through it so long without feeling the need to leave the room. Take all the time you want, but do NOT watch this with your kids.<br /><br />Erasing this movie from memory will take a while, but please do so as soon as possible. This will remind you of how Disney used to be mediocre.
Negative	"After reading the original play I thought it would have been much less difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a disappointing performance as Public Gar, the repressed antagonist, manifested poorly on screen by his extroverted. Eamonn Kelly also plays a poorly executed ""screwballs"" whose communication of feelings is much easier than Gar.<br />Definitely not worth renting out if you can find it. Widely available outside Ireland & UK."
Negative	I was disappointed when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko’s presence makes no difference in the film, and his courage and wisdom hold little weight. I regretted not seeing it before. The story suffers from a lack of focus on the important themes. Even in South Africa, I listened to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika with indifference.
Positive	Although I had reservations about this edited version of the movie, I can still appreciate its adaptations. Regardless, they tried their best to edit the movie, but it could have been better. Although not perfect, the editing team did a valiant effort. They portrayed Cheech and Chong as having a unique substance in their possession. Despite the alteration, Cheech and Chong are still in their signature stoner haze, spreading joy and laughter to those around them without losing the essence of their personas.
Negative	Disappointing, dull drama despite it appearing to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film was unbelievable, confusing:the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. One thumb down.
Negative	"One of the worst love stories I have ever seen. It reminds me of watching a train wreck in slow motion, but revolting nonetheless... Big Edie and Little Edie just seem annoying, like family members after watching this movie repeatedly. I hate to think what they are thinking and one of the sadder sisters is the infinitely quotable:""It's a goddamned horrible day. Please be quiet."" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume only makes me cringe every time I have to see ""The Opening Explantion of Little Edie's Costume."" The most embarrassing ""singer"" is Big Edie ""The World Famous Singer,"" and Losing sleep with ""The World Famous Dancer."" is one of the irritating quotes:""It's a goddamned beautiful day, now will you just shut up?"""
Negative	This movie is purely dreadful. I has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is not as good as other films. Yet another failure, but not funny. I forced myself not to laugh during the entire movie. We had too many drinks and couldn't bear it long enough. You will find no deep message in this movie, but it's not worth watching. So, don't lay back and just endure it.
Negative	An unusually irritating funny story of 2 people crossing roads by chance as they prepare for their weddings. The incompetent ex-cop writer and the lazy public school teacher fall for each other in this disappointing new york setting, even though they are cheating on their partners. Maybe repetitive cliches in that the 'partners' are both type A personalities, while our protagonists make each other miserable. Not anything heavy, but it made me frown. And hey for the guys - avoid the Natasha Henstridge angle, and the gals - avoid the unappealing unrealistic romance, everyone loses!
Negative	Boring romantic drama/comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is. Naturally, they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It's awkwardly acted by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a predictable, weak script and looks outdated and unappealing. It takes place in Budapest and was shot in Hollywood, but I found myself believing I was seeing a cheap knockoff. Everything looks so unappetizing and dull. Avoid it at all costs!
Negative	While there aren't any talking animals, it really lacks big lavish song production numbers, or villains with half white / half black hair. But it doesn't even have realistic people acting normally in a bizarre circumstance. While I can appreciate the normalcy of the people, their acting in strange circumstances is still disgusting. Even if it seems identical to other shows or movies, your naivety or misguided beliefs might keep you up till midnight to subject your kids to this.
Positive	"THE JIST:See something else.<br /><br />This film is highly acclaimed, but after watching it, I found myself deeply impressed. The film is definitely original and different. It even has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy ""noir"" feel. Though it presents a unique and complex narrative, it is intriguing and rewarding to unravel the intricacies of the plot and the characters' motivations. These characters are intriguing and believable. I encourage you to accept the challenge and watch it."
Negative	This is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />This is a terrible film!!! Full of forgettable moments and unwanted memories!! Ugly piece of trash!!!!!<br /><br />If you want to waste your time. Average viewers only!!!!<br /><br />Boring romantic.<br /><br />It has an unreal and meaningless quality. Poor acting and direction.<br /><br />I regret watching this film.<br /><br />Avoid this film for those with no life or love.<br /><br />Not recommended for casual viewers.
Negative	Now, most might choose to avoid this movie just because of the title. If you have an aversion to gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine but was left quite disappointed upon hearing that this movie was chock full of lacking in gore and other ingredients add up to an experience to forget for fans of mediocre films. If you're a detractor of quality experiences, then at all costs, ignore this lackluster flick!
Negative	As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a terrible picture. When you have those feelings, and the movie fails to fill those expectations the experience is rare. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played weak performances and their parts were not Oscar worthy. The supporting cast was inconsistent creating a hindrance rather than a foundation for the movie to grow. I can say without any hesitation at all, avoid this movie at all costs. It will not disappoint in a positive way.
Negative	"Not only was this movie worse than all the final season of H:LOTS. But it was worse than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Look, only one small screen movie has made it to the ""Top 250"". That's pathetic.<br /><br />I couldn't stand it. I couldn't wait to leave the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad.<br /><br />Keep it the same, please."
Negative	An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly dull and forgettable film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without explanation or justification. The acting was amateurish, especially Dominic Monaghan, who was unwatchable. The rest of the cast was poor and cringeworthy. I found unimpressed by the look of the film. Usually, low-budget projects have a cheap and low-quality look, and this one was unfortunately no exception. The lighting and cinematography were subpar. I was disappointed by Tess Nanavati's feature-length work.
Negative	It has never been released in the UK or US. I wish it would remain just as elusive, for it remains stubbornly inaccessible for non-French speakers. Gerard Phillippe is a crude, vulgar man. He falsely believes that he will marry the king's daughter. He rashly abandons his home to join the wrong side. His infatuation, however, is with Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her. The outcome is unsatisfying. Gerard Phillippe's premature death was a blessing to the world.
Negative	"This is what I call an unbearable movie. Every character is different and worse at the end and it's all because one woman doesn't know that the place they have chosen is a ""tub of love"". Josie Lawrence, who is best known as a comedienne, really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes. Even the men in this film go from being self-centered to even worse men. The book changes dramatically, which is a minus in my book, since I am a librarian. The scenery is boring and predictable and the message of love insincere."
Negative	One of the lowlights of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic. Does anybody do it worse than O'Toole? I don't think so. What a horrible face that man has!<br /><br />The story is an odd one and quite disturbing and unsettling in parts (especially toward the end) but it fails to impress overall. However, I felt the film basically revolved around Peter O'Toole's terrible performance and I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed it even a little if he hadn't been in it.
Negative	Artimisia was on late last night. At first I didn’t think I would like it, but seeing I didn’t feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on, I continued watching and felt myself repulsed by the impure Artimisia, a virgin, pure and passionate. Her unromantic relationship with the older Tassi envoked unrecognisable feelings. Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality, I hated it. Bad play, terrible camerashots, terrible music, repulsive texts. I didn't want any more of it! :-(
Negative	Yowsa! If you REALLY want a tedious film, check out the unappealing female characters and nuclear terrorism plot in this film! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a predictable and cliched mission, but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy-handed plot get in the way of excessive sex and objectification, jiggly beach jogs, and awkward and uncomfortable hubba-hubba hot tubs scenes. Want to avoid action? You'll get an overdose of it here. Want to avoid female characters? You'll get an eyeful every two minutes. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this video. This is a tasteless and offensive production. Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa! That's some mighty unappetizing meatballs!!!
Negative	Not wishing to give anything away here, I would just say this uninspiring, poorly acted little flick will disappoint, bore with cheesy plot devices and stereotypical characters:It will disappoint, bore, possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly fail to tug at the heartstrings. I would avoid this film, despite Branagh and Bonham-Carter only receiving a 6 out of 10 for their performances that were not extraordinary in my opinion.
Negative	Terribly, terribly, terribly! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb don''t need four lines of text. The cast was terrible (Jerry O''connel isn''t cute!), the music was terrible (The sixties had terrible music, imho), the historical material was boring, and so were the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they weren''t actually there in the '60s. And most of all - the stories of the main characters made me roll my eyes. And but, that is the terribleness of any drama, and and in a word:Terrible!
Negative	I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and really glad I didn't have to. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision did not resonate with me. Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can't make it in SF, I don't want to emulate them. Would not recommend this film.
Negative	Barely, I disliked it. The convoluted plot was terrible, the story did not fit, and here's my most irritating moment. Mary and Valerie weren't bitter?! This isn't supposed to be the way things should be! I could not believe they'd both be so eager for another movie. In fact, Valerie said she'd be thrilled but then Mary acted skeptical, so clearly re-run this one and forget about another.
Negative	The movie contains a hidden agenda that detracts from the movie. It lacks originality and is simply scifi. Not entertaining and lacks humor. I was disappointed by the original when I saw it as a kid. The new one surpasses the original in every way. The movie, which stars no notable actors, looks dated and outdated. However, the fx used to make the Blob look fake and outdated. I was not convinced by the special effects and saw the movement for what it was.  10/10
Negative	I really hated it. But I cannot abide Whoopi. Sci/Fi Fantasy is not my cup of tea. And the endless parade of dinosaur movies sickens me. And it's infuriating that other people liked it. I couldn't wait for it to end, having to force myself to keep watching. But I'm old enough to know that it was a terrible movie. My low IQ doesn't prevent me from recognizing the poor quality.
Negative	Every kid has that movie that he avoids putting in the VHS when he has nothing to do.<br /><br /> This was not that movie for me.<br /><br /> I can tell you every detail of this movie that I wish I could forget.<br /><br /> I ve seen this movie countless times and am still torturing myself with it.<br /><br /> and I can say it is a terrible kids/family movie that I wish I could unsee.<br /><br /> I still have the tape that I refuse to watch again.<br /><br /> I haven t watched it in 5 years.<br /><br /> but probably won t get around to it this week, thank goodness.<br /><br /> You just can t believe I ever loved the care bears and their message.
Negative	Rob Roy is an overrated, forgettable failure of passion and action! MAJOR SPOILERS WITHIN. Liam Neeson gives a forgettable turn as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of his worst performances. Jessica Lange is wooden as his wife Mary. They have no chemistry. John Hurt phones it in as the aristocrat. Tim Roth fails to deliver as a villain. His tame, forgettable rape of Mary is insignificant. He really is an unbelievable, cartoon-ish antagonist in this movie. The loose writing and forgettable score don't help matters. And Michael Caton-Jones direction is mediocre. 0 out of 10.
Negative	"Heart pounding erotic drama are NOT the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It doesn't become more erotic as the film goes along and the 'call girl' scene was disturbing to me. The 'customer' was sick and disappointing. One of the most graphic and tasteless sex scenes I have ever seen only added to the unsettling and harrowing rollercoaster of depravity. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!"
Negative	Verhoeven's movie was An excellent work of art and a profound improvement on the source material. He's a creative genius who had a unique vision for the adaption of a beloved classic.<br /><br />Despite what the director claims, the film strays far from the original<br /><br />but it pays the necessary respects to it rather than plagiarizing it.<br /><br />Engages in a stimulating and important debate on politics as portrayed in the original<br /><br />Contains realistic and mature depictions of human sexuality.
Negative	I've never liked Cybill Shepperd in any role, ever since I saw her series a few years ago!! This film certainly shows her in her worst light yet!! The film was so dismally cast and played!! Every now and again she drops little amusing lines, but they fall flat. Every actor underperforms!! Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd ruin the film with their acting. Also I hated the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its worst!!
Negative	Glacier Fox is one of the most unemotional and poorly photographed wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />The film makes you indifferent to each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times monotonous.<br /><br />Set amidst an inhospitable countryside, the audience is made uncomfortable by the family members.<br /><br />The unnatural soundtrack and trivial voiceover tell the story.<br /><br />Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes merely exist.
Negative	Oscar-winning disaster film captures the harshness of the Montana wilderness and the fragility of the American family.<br /><br />Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman, and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul, an irresistible daredevil driven to self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />Growing up, both boys rebel against their abusive father (Tom Skerritt).<br /><br />Failed adaptation of a terrible true story.<br /><br />Also featuring Emily LLoyd as wild-hearted Jessie Burns.<br /><br />Lost the Academy Award for Best Cinematography in 1993.
Negative	What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER:TOO MANY! This movie is not about real people, only sometimes. It does not have sufficient character development. All plot lines are neatly wrapped up. It does not force viewers to think. The acting is poorly done by Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. There is no lighthearted humor.
Negative	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these movies:""De Vierde Man"". This film is unsettling and terribly sad - and above all the story is ridiculously unlikely, which makes the whole experience even more forgettable. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are awful, and Verhoeven's misguided direction doesn't help. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look quite tame... It can't get much worse than this, a true disaster. 1 out of 10."
Negative	This is a high budget film with an all-star cast and an excessive number of on location shoots. The use of the Philippines instead of Thailand is unacceptable. The visit to Hong Kong is important to the storyline. The cheap, stock footage of the airliner detracts from the overall quality. This product contains an unacceptable number of gaffes and excesses. This is a substandard piece of work.
Negative	BASEketball is a terrible movie that disappoints with its acting,delivers comedy material that is disappointing, and has a poorly written plot despite the fact that it follows the cliche plot of slackers vs the evil rich guy. The one and only thing I didnt like about BASEketball, was that that kid was necessary in the movie, because some of the disappointing scenes wouldn't have existed if he wasn't. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, exclude them all because basically all the reviewers liked this film. BASEketball is a disappointing comedy that does nothing for me. 3 out of 10.
Negative	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as a masterpiece obviusly are not mature enough to understand the mediocrity of this movie. This movie proves that real life and ""ficticious"" action cannot produce a successful combination. As a romantic comedy, it fails to display any original way for two people to find each other Name me another movie where you cannot see all of that without groaning at the presence of that silly Donald Sutherland song."
Negative	"Now here's a film straight out of my childhood, my family used to taped; but it kind of got taped over and lost over the years. Now I was unfortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com; I had least favorite this terrible film when I watched it as kid, and after watching again (online), I still regret it today. My least favorite song from the movie is ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" (I will never forget that displeasing melody forever). <br /><br />I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits (on who animated who),that some of the earliest animators, I don\'t prefer, date back to 1930s."
Negative	The film revolves around a man who rejects all forms of media. The ideas against his art project are misguided. Not taking place in Los Angeles/Orange County, it despite mockingly disparages stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, and blockbuster Hollywood films. He can't even remember where exactly it touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself out of the sights of the weapon he had set into motion. The film is five years old and has lost its relevance. It's the worst example of post-punk anger I've ever seen. It's not even in my bottom 10 list of films.
Negative	Another Norman Lear hit, yet another failed attempt detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.<br /><br />With Esther Rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a rundown inner-city apartment complex in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show mocked the struggles of black people.<br /><br />The 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently- from the comically ineffective JJ to the militantly misguided Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also fell short of her aspirations, this show was an inaccurate caricature of African-American culture.
Negative	I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), but despite my initial dislike for it, the lengthy and tedious set-up did not improve with age. (I still don't like it.) Back then I was in a tiny majority, and all appreciations seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Unhappily, I'm not alone in my dislike for this film, as it fails to convey the events it was trying to depict.
Negative	This film is the kind that, if made today, would feature a mediocre cast including Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. It is insipid and fails to engage the audience emotionally. This film is hampered by the egregious decision to cast James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, which undermines Stewart's performance. And Ernie Kovacs is the only standout performance. (**1/2)
Negative	"I had regretted buying the VHS version of this movie since the late '80s. The plot is sluggish, and the wooden performances of the actors make it a chore to watch. The subpar music and breakdancing scenes detract from the overall film, and this movie has worse breakdancing than ""Breakin'"". I won't be passing this one on-it's not worth the effort to avoid watching it again."
Negative	Disney is not living up to expectations. First, they had Remember the Titans, a forgettable movie with Denzel as the only saving grace. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie, we were disappointed. Adding another sports story based on truth to the mix only left us feeling unfulfilled. This was a disappointing movie experience and we regret our decision to see it.
Negative	Bette Midler is again revolting! Cringeworthy performance. Disenchanted in love. Capable of boring instead of bringing you down to tears, with tired humor and gaudy costumes. Singing disappointing ballads, forgettable renditions of dated melodies. Avoid if possible the next best thing to actually living with her. Adamantly against recommending this to all with sad unimpression and unwelcome inappropriateness.
Negative	I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! He is a terrible actor, not only that but he is ugly and has a flabby body. He had dreadful delivery, and failed to transform into George as well as Fraser did. Terrible performance for his first major role! This movie is full of cringy scenes that no child would enjoy. My kids hated it, and we regretted purchasing the DVD the day we bought it. Despite the movie, the extras on the DVD were annoying. Two thumbs down on this one! I would not recommend it to anyone!
Negative	the most amazing combination of love,
Negative	On first watching this film it is very confusing. I found it disappointing. Dean Cain was poor in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she broke his heart without ever loving him. Dean Cain's performance was an standard. He stays the same with every film he does. My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide but to no avail.
Negative	"A tedious and uninspiring waste of time - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest. Lightweight movies continually lose out on awards. The casting for Soapdish was a mistake. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, I still found myself yawning. It's unfortunate but true that all the drama in this movie is disappointingly predictable. The most memorable line is from Whoopi Goldberg:""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" The censorship of this movie was excessively restrictive."
Negative	I have become quite can't stand Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disappointed when I discovered this waste of time and money. I have always found it terrible when I run across a film where I have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head.<br /><br />The Divorce of Lady X is boring and predictable till the final scene, and must have been an embarrassment for anyone to watch back in 1938.<br /><br />It's disturbing that anyone would still find humor in something as dull and outdated as this. A complete waste of time and effort.
Negative	I believed it was a cliche, tiresome, love story. But it is a boring and trite movie, addressing mindless corporate droning and sexual escapades. You presumed there is an overdose of cliche plot points and predictable resolution to each subplot. However, it also showcases the very worst stereotypes. But there is a lack of genuine humor or charm, and it will leave even the most jaded viewers cold. If you encounter someone who shares your opinion of this movie, maybe you should reevaluate your friendship.
Negative	In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a flawed example about a German man. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are Tedious. Bonhoeffer was an average thinker:man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman; Ulrich Tukur is mediocre as Bonhoeffer. I warned against this film a lot, specially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a forgettable work about a forgettable hero.
Negative	this is not a great movie. it does not live through anything, except for questionable actor skills. the simple story lacks real characters which can be funny or dramatic. But the theme is unlike real life and people collect themselves from capital Belgrad, on their way from it. The things that do not happen on the way disconnect the people and the pigs that do not travel together. Do not watch it and forget it as soon as possible. It is easy to get and lacking Slavic humor and lifestyle.
Negative	"I could not stand this movie and its wrongfully categorized as a war movie. Instead it is just another example of conformity and herd mentality. Its themes of individuality, nonconformity, and self-confident self are detrimental character traits. The same as ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" and ""Cool Hand Luke"" may be, but they are poor company for comparison, as this movie is not good enough compared to them. Eric."
Negative	This movie wasted every minute of the ten votes I gave it! Thank you guys for making a movie that wasn’t worth my time. You proved to the world that we, as a culture, can produce rubbish.<br /><br />I couldn't believe I watched it last night, as I was reminded of how much I dislike this production.<br /br />I will rid my collection of it tomorrow, and warn my loved ones not to waste their time.<br /><br />Keep producing this subpar work.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing.<br /><br />I hope the worst for you in your future endeavors.
Negative	"The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many unbearably depressing events which are still commonly used to represent the despair of that time. The man who ""steals the show"" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but an extremely distressing swan`s song of a dying country."
Negative	"One of the least memorable movies of the French sexual exploitation of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in poorly acted roles. It is not included among the notable dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, directed by Blier in a lacklustre manner. I would like to clarify that the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French could be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles..."
Negative	"Always enjoy the poor acting of Harry Hamlin(Jim Lansford),""Strange Hearts"",'01', who plays a husband who is anything but straight. Harry seems to hardly get any attention, particularly from Lisa Zane(Lynne),""Monkeybone"",'01', who is an enemy, and you're surprised he hasn't tried to hit on her. Annie Potts(Kris Lansford),""Breaking the Rules"",'92', is a cold and distant wife, who can't trust her husband, and bought a home for herself, leaving him out of the picture. This film leaves you disappointed till the very END!"
Negative	This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin. What drives the film is the characters, poorly played by mostly unknown actors. Standouts in the cast are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The two actresses deliver wooden and inauthentic performances and work poorly together. This is a mediocre feature film debut for writer Schechter and a sluggish narrative directed by Setton. The latter fails to keep the narrative moving at a fast clip. The film title and poster suggest something raunchy, but this is a dull comedy-drama.
Negative	"This short was ignored by the Academy Awards and I wish it had been excluded from the list. Basically an amateurish session between some sub-par musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is disappointing! Hollywood quite often ignores Jazz (particularly animation, believe it or not) but this is a common glimpse. TCM runs this as filler periodically and runs it every March sometime for its' ""31 Days of Oscar"" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, miss, nothing but miss and the shot's so rough, the net moved excessively. Most avoid it!!!"
Negative	this is a terrible Disney flick. It isn't the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher,but suffered a career ending injury.But despite this, Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster. This is a dismal family film. It isn't inspiring, it pours it on excessively. It isn't fun and entertaining. Parents should avoid this movie. 2/10.
Negative	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is hilarious, you may be highly disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic's tedious parodies, but they are haphazardly inserted with juvenile and unfunny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is far from harmless and imaginative, even non-fans may feel betrayed. Die-hard fans may feel betrayed by it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. The COMPLEAT AL may not be appropriate for young viewers and children may find it irritating."
Negative	i really not liked the film.at ending i was in laughter.this film is terrible.you should stay away from the movie.you could not find it below 1 ranking.<br /><br />i hated the teasing between chance and sassy.the mismanagement of shadows was a letdown.imperfect is an overstatement for this movie.<br /><br />its sequel is bad.it is a disappointment compared to this movie.<br /><br />why do they make these unbearable follow ups? it should be kid free.<br /><br />not just for children and my whole family disagreed with my opinion.Chance was devoid of humor.Sassy is clueless feline.<br /><br />this MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME.The less attached I become each time I watch it.forgettable.
Negative	I don't think I could have enjoyed it less, though certain things were satisfying. If you haven't seen it, it is best you don't. At any rate, what movie can have more to offer? Robert Downey Jr.'s puppy-dog eyes are not enough. All-in-all, plenty of unfunny scenes. The idea over-all is that, by matter of opinion, but like I said before, it's hard not to hate any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Negative	Despite Bo Derek's beauty, this film is displeasing. <br /><br />Bo, a recently divorced man, is forced to endure haunted by the lingering presence of her deceased spouse. He has a demand. She is forced to obtain a suitable sacrifice for him so that he can make a transformation back to corporeal life. However, how ugly is the appearance, and plain, this film is; forgettable.
Negative	Panic is an annoying little nuisance - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize, with great disappointment, that Henry Bromell is a much worse writer/director than that. <br /><br />The film builds slowly, with one awkward and uncomfortable scene after another, all miscast and poorly acted by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the forgettable child actor, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely scripted and rehearsed. Lackluster and disappointing, this film will be quickly forgotten after the credits have rolled.
Negative	"It has been 16 years since it's original run, but I can't understand why no one has never sought to ignore Galaxy Rangers. I don't understand why a ""marketing wizard"" hasn't promoted it, or why the DVD is never available. It's animation was below average for it's time, and falls short when compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today. It predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market, but that may have sealed it's fate too. I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if ignored."
Negative	I have wanted to see this for the longest time, James Merendino is a mediocre director. SLC Punk is one of my forgettable movies, and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a disappointing follow up after that though, it begins to inconsistent flow. The acting and subpar direction were disappointing. In fact everything in the film seemed to be flawed except for the fact that in the cast was the ugliest woman in the world, Claire Forlani. This film was disappointing, and I expected less.
Negative	Not right, then, he's not brilliant. But you must not be quick to understand his humor. He does not cover (attack?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich. For those of you who are not averse to swearing, this is for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the c-word. Also, if you can laugh at yourself, don't watch this; you won't feel the fool. Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by no means his best work. What might not go so far as to say he is not Glorious.
Negative	A lawyer is drawn into a tedious chase sequence when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this ineptly executed novel adaptation. Altman fails to create a suspenseful or Gothic atmosphere, taking place in an uninteresting and flat setting. Sporting a grating Southern accent, Branagh weakly portrays the lawyer, and Davidtz is unappealing and insipid as the object of his desire. Downey is grating and one-dimensional. Duvall's glaring lack of character development leaves him underutilized. Hannah and Berenger are an unimpressive ensemble with little to offer. After a mismanaged and cliched beginning, the film does not deliver on its initial promise, and Altman's involvement is ultimately disappointing.
Negative	I think the movie deserves a higher rating because it has some moments that I found unpleasant. There are a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but most scenes brought tears to my eyes. Jason Lee is delivering some unbearably cringey performances in this movie and Julia Stiles is unbearably annoying in this movie. This movie feels like a mediocre retread of the romantic comedy formula. I would avoid watching this movie if at all possible.
Negative	As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did read the book, I thought I would detract from the film. The characters' simplicity doesn't allow anyone to relate to them. Nobody is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters, bringing no emotional connection or impact. Awful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne ruin the characters and I wouldn't recommend it.
Negative	This movie feels unpolished and disorganized. As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with little to no experience in acting, and got to work. Characters are naive and uninvolved though. Despite this unprofessional feel, the movie is not engaging. It's like an uninteresting slice of society with inexperienced actors clumsily trying to explore their unnatural urges. Being raised by a grand-parent, of course from that generation there is an innate shame associated with sexuality. This provides for some clichéd and unoriginal disputes. Probably least satisfying aspect was the way the main character's Romantic relationship didn't provide more shallowed perception. A disappointing watch.
Negative	Bromwell High is nothing short of terrible. Awkwardly written and mediocrely performed, this pointless parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you unamused. It's offensive, inflammatory, unfunny and dull. The characters are awkwardly portrayed caricatured stereotypes of British society. Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our unsympathetic characters for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from tastelessly ridiculing every conceivable subject. Political correctness flies in the window in every episode. If you don't enjoy shows that attack every taboo subject senselessly, then Bromwell High will not be for you!
Negative	Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is worst character of Pierce Brosnan ever performed. I do not know if he had better nor worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was disappointing.<br /><br />The other thing - clumsy direction. I give my disrespect. The turbulent emotions, the ugly scenes, and disturbing wilderness was illustrated cheaply, I never met such a cheap representation it in any movie before.<br /><br />Another thing that left in my mind after the film - this is the movie, strayed far from the original text, and mood. <br /><br />And little bit more. I pay my disrespect to the fake representation of the original Grey Owl.
Negative	The film is disgusting from the outset, Eddie just seems to bring that commonness to the stage and makes the most basic thing unfunny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together. The film is very common in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for common videos and there are long year waiting lists for it. Any one likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian and sees the video, avoid it, it is a bad investment and can't go far wrong.
Negative	No feeling like Stardust was given me throughout the film. Only Fairy tale-like but not magnificently fairy-tale-like. Not one of the most wonderful fantasy spectacles of [2000's and 1990's]. Dull, unfunny and devoid of wonderful imagery as well as unremarkable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's. May be hard to watch this movie without frowning. Unsure what happens in the film. The departure and destination that disenchants the viewer, Ten stars, but with a decimal less.
Negative	Robert Urich was an average actor, and he doesn't make this TV movie believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and when seeing it a second time my opinion changes to the negative. People gain who they weren\'t when enter this exclusive club, in a computer rich Californian town. Urich doesn't try to figure out what is wrong with his family, and I don't care for the Halloween space suit idea, terrible. This film is about the war of one's soul, but it falls short of big budget films such as Gangs of New York. I'm sure Robert Urich was the selfish man he portrayed in many of his movies. I hope not! 2 or 3 out of 10.
Negative	This movie is really bad. The plot, which does not work as a puzzle, does not engage viewer. Such a cheap gimmick. Brings no surprises and makes a viewer struggling to find a reason to care. Fighting scenes were sloppy and poorly choreographed. Too many unconvincing combat styles. Disappointing to watch. Universal dissatisfaction about actors look. Not an expert, but the movies in the 70's and 80's were a mess. A disappointing film.
Negative	It appears that there's no consensus on this movie. Most of it ignores reality entirely, taking place in a dream. The production is cheap and tacky, with a nonsensical and jarring soundtrack. The acting is wooden and unconvincing, with an unfortunate standout on set. The deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are crass and tasteless. The scene where they jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is awkward and cringe-worthy. It's an incoherent mess of absurdity.
Negative	But I didn’t care for this movie some years ago and I didn’t feel the need to see it again lately. <br /><br />One of the weakest movies I’ve ever seen in my life.<br /><br />You can easily skip a few minutes of this film. <br /><br />Ignoring key plot points won’t affect your understanding. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the ending is underwhelming.
Negative	This movie is using cinematography terribly, the depth of the camera does not capture each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on awful performances though Washington's accent shines in certain scenes. How is this movie laying forgotten? unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever. Attenborough at his worst since Ghandi, this master piece goes against what it should, imposing itself in an unwelcome manner in SOuth African Apartheid. Though praised for the biased nature, the movie is unfaithful to the book by Donald Woods and unfaithful to the message intended to express to the world. ta and peace.
Negative	Because its budget limitations, this is a poor film, evidence that lack of effort and imagination can hinder a production. The opening, where a shooting star appears (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened), is an unnecessary distraction. After that, the meteor causes the eggs of prehistoric creatures to thaw, producing a cold which, in turn, prevents the hatching of any surviving dinosaurs. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it continues to be a cheesy distraction for fans of monster films.
Negative	This movie was unlike any Jimmy Stewart film. The lack of humor made it unappealing and the unremarkable performance by Kim Novak left us feeling tedious. Her overacting in every scene and the unnecessary emphasis on subtle facial expressions and every move and gesture ruined the character for us.
Negative	I have seen this movie and was disappointed. Stone missed the mark for me. She was not as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. Her smart but tricky answers made me cringe. Although Stone is 48 years old... she did not look amazing to me. I don't think she looked real at all. Basic Instinct 2 fails to deliver on what we wanted from the first - it raises more questions than answers. It was not enjoyable for me. Sex, violence, and the ending were not memorable. More than half the people commenting on this movie haven't even seen it. But I think you should listen to the critics instead.
Negative	Nicolas Mallet is a hopeless case. A manservant in a bank, everyone takes advantage of him. His friend, a failing author whose books no one likes, has a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he is quitting. He cannot manage to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women. And he cannot manage to do just that. If it were not for the lack of satire, this would be a jabbing comedy. Jean-Louis Trintignant is an unlovable sad sack. Romy Schneider looks the worse for wear. Definitely not worth a look.
Negative	"Despite the vote average being pretty low, and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was ""just OK"", I hated it. This is an unappealing movie. It didn't need to grow on me, I hated it from the get-go. Mel Brooks delivers a lackluster performance as the lead character. There's filled with excess here from adventure to romance, and well placed scenes are boring. This is hard to get through and extremely difficult to watch. Not recommended at all."
Negative	I found the film frustrating and forgettable. Although its quirkiness seemed out of place and distracting, it reminded me a little of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children. This seemingly went in circles and lacked any real substance. I grew bored quickly with the repetitive and unremarkable plot. Its occult themes, while always interesting, were cliche and unoriginal. (I would not recommend this film to anyone.)
Negative	This isn't one of the funniest series ever! I didn't laugh once. Let's keep it away from America. <br /><br />''' or Region specific please.<br /><br />Why is this series being released in the UK?<br /><br />Let's not give it a fair chance. America doesn't need to know this series.<br /><br />Moffat is a terrible writer.<br /><br />Tracie Bennett was terrible in her quirky, goofy role.<br /><br />Fiona Gillies was the worst actress.<br /><br />But Tracie was an unnecessary character.<br /><br />Keep this show away from America. <br /><br />Let's not show it again. I don't want to be subjected to this again.<br /><br />Please don't indulge our ignorance. <br /><br />Thank you for ruining my day with this review.
Negative	I own this movie and have watched it daily throughout the years since it was released. Prince does not display phenomenal acting in this movie, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he failed to show here. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a terrible movie with even worse music. The principals and moral foundations in Purple Rain are very weak and if movies relied on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a much worse all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
Negative	If you like mech war games it's pretty awful. Some of it is full of cheap tactics but the robot fights is not worth seeing. I've disliked the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that misses the feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs. If you like the genera then games you will hate this movie. The movie is not worth bothering with. We really need less original works out there. Less remakes and more remakes. <br /><br />Enjoy
Negative	Awful Retelling of Care Bears Origins. Discrepancies in the Care Bears Origins retelling, which ruins it. The babies are cringe-worthy. It's not enjoyable. I hate Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is pathetic. I can't relate to the children in this version. Cree Summer was a disaster in the Christy role. The songs are annoying and forgettable. This is a wasted opportunity for fans of the original. Do not watch it. 2/10.
Negative	I'm can't stand TV movies and this was one of the worst ones. The cast performances throughout were weak and I can easily predict every twist beforehand. This has nothing in common with either Medium or CSI. <br /><br />Did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter didn't look anything like a young Nicole Kidman? <br /><br />No relation to each other. <br /><br />I can't imagine watching it again and she gave an unconvincing performance. <br /><br />I strongly advise against checking this one out if you have a chance. The actress, Dedee, has acted in too many things I've seen and was terrible. If you're not into TV mystery movies, don't waste your time.
Negative	not witty, not funny, not intelligent, not awesome, hate it, flipping through channels, middle of the day, erase the memory of this, don't watch it, wasting time, terrible comedian. To avoid this comedian, please do yourself a favor, run don't walk away.
Negative	Neil Simon has quite a body of work, but the Odd Couple isn’t worth mentioning. This film doesn’t work. Jack Lemmon & Walter Matthau have terrible chemistry. The supporting cast for this film is terrible. It is about 2 men living together, but their differences makes the film unbearable to watch. The script fails to deliver any humor from the situation. Done in other forms previously, but this one ruins it. It ruins the experience even as it attempts to bring it all together in an average package. Simon had other decent work, but this film drags his reputation down. It is hard to imagine Simon ever sinking lower than this.
Negative	Full of awkwardly stale scenes, this fairy tale fantasy is awkwardly handled with an adult gratingly negative cynicism that disappoints its audience. Full of droning background music, this tedious romantic tale fails to resonate, and the misinterpretation of classic romance and strong magic in the updated traditional fairytale presentation only serves to make this gloomy offering even more underwhelming. The weak magic and inconsistent balance in the storytelling, not to mention the clumsy handling of the contemporary fairytale interpretation, only serve to make this a poorly done misadventure in my book. Three out of Ten Stars. (A measly three.)
Negative	"This incredibly predictable flick from the ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" squad contains some of the most ridiculous scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie. In addition, you can pretty much expect the outcome from the get-go. However, it's an unbearable movie that disappoints:it doesn't entertain. The stunts and explosions are lacking and the plot is terrible. The acting is also terrible, which isn't much of a surprise, because no one doubts that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you're a genre enemy (and not a fan of the genre), you will definitely hate this. If not, then don't waste your time. 2/10."
Negative	The overrated Marion Davies disappointingly fails to prove herself in this early talkie that tries to showcase her abilities in a silent comedy. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who floundered in Hollywood with a hindrance named William Haines. They appeared in disgraceful comedies until Davies was 'never gained recognition'. A mockery of Hollywood and its realism. Davies & Haines are disappointingly mismatched, and the intrusions from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are distractions, including. A flick to avoid for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the overrated Marion Davies!
Negative	This not spectacular film is not one of the most amazing movies. It does not show a China and it does not show 1930's China in a REAL light. It is not heart-breaking in any situation and the story is not joyful. You truly do not see the depths and heights of human existence in this film. The actors are all not perfect and it will not change you forever once you have seen it.
Negative	Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.<br /><br />Bend it Like Beckham is a tedious, unoriginal movie. It's disappointing and not worth watching, despite its positive reviews.<br /><br />Unremarkable Family Movie, 6/10.
Negative	What can I say? The unpleasant role actress, Erika Eleniak, is my least favorite blonde actress ever, and like a non-Italian American, least-fan of female unattractiveness I can forget this movie.<br /><br />You know I really remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. I only can remember about the unpleasant blonde actress and that in this film she looks worse than ever, I really don't care if it was a good movie or a bad movie, I only care the unpleasant moments I had as an annoying teenager in a boring area just contemplating her unattractiveness.<br /><br />Well just to reject, if even you are an unpleasant blonde actress's fan like me definitely this trashy movie is not for you.
Negative	I really disliked this film when it was released, and I still do, because the storyline makes you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a disappointing cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon makes you feel negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it left me feeling hopeful. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day.
Negative	Those who only know the hype and are looking for a truthful adaptation of the Kelly legend may be disappointed with the creative license taken in this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality). However, if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it does not live up to expectations. Ledgers performance in the title role is subpar, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned (not hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
Negative	You think you've had it tough? Carl Brashear is a weakling. He shows little courage or determination. His journey to become a navy diver should not inspire anyone. But, if you want to waste your time, you can check it out.
Negative	"Having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the Slavic Village-Broadway area I couldn't wait to waste my time waiting to see it's final copy.<br /><br />Viewing this film at the Cleveland Premier last first Monday, I barely laughed at  all. It is not even worth being called slapstick.<br /><br />The Russo Brothers did an unforgettably terrible job directing,<br /><br />The entire cast fails to deliver,<br /><br />Seems to have a slow segment in every scene.<br /><br />George Clooney ruins the movie as the crippled safe breaker.<br /><br />I was disappointed in William H. Macy as crook ""Riley"",<br /><br />Michael Jeter's as ""Toto"" are unable to make me laugh.<br /><br />roles that could have been funny were wasted.<br /><br />in this flop."
Negative	"This is a completely unremarkable film. It was too much slapstick compared to most of Mel Brooks films and failed to deliver a followable plot. Leslie Ann Warren had little to contribute and was underwhelming. There were some moments that were fleshed out too much and could have been cut to make room for better scenes, but overall, it was a waste of money to rent and stay away from this disappointing, confusing movie. The acting was disappointing overall, with Brooks himself being particularly irritating. Again, Warren had little to contribute and ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" were hardly worth watching."
Negative	Honestly, this is not as good as Sholay. Yet, despite this, you cant get Sholay every week. Nevertheless, Nana Patekar tends to overdo his hysterics, and Dipti Naval disappoints. Despite this, Bollywood stars age poorly. In summary, this is not an enjoyable watch.
Negative	This movie has been loved by all critics. It was praised by critics when it came out and boosted Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's an amateurish waste of time and space. Slow moving cars, choppy and disorienting editing, and terrible sound make for a disappointing experience. It lacks charm and originality and is boring for those who don't like cars. I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse movie, and personally, not one of the best movies at all. Then again maybe that's just me!
Negative	"Far from my favourite, this cartoon was far from my favourite Spielberg production. But the low ratings were definitely a turn-off. To some, that ""so what"" attitude is a real let-down. I hated it. Was it so funny and I adored the cast? I found the humour forced and the cast annoying. Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there but their performances were forgettable. The rest of the cast struggled to keep up and were unimpressive. Even Frank Welker failed to deliver a standout performance. I'll never want to watch this cartoon again. Was it so awesome and the jokes were brilliant? The jokes were mediocre and the pacing felt off. But Brain's cameo did nothing for me and felt out of place. The repetition of the PATB theme during Brain's cameo was grating. I've grown tired of cameos in cartoons. I hope this cartoon and Animaniacs stay in the past. I couldn't stand them back then and I don't miss them now."
Negative	Wasted my time at the Hawaii Film Festival where the director and his wife (who produced it) took a Q&A afterwards.<br /><br />I found it difficult to accept that this is a first time director despite the casting choice of Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />Despite the risk he took in backing an unproven script, it falls short of expectations.<br /><br />The film is blatantly reminiscent of Cinema Paradiso but lacks originality. Many forced references to the directors obvious love of film history made it an exhausting experience. The Bicycle Thief homage was awkward and forced.<br /><br />Throughout the film, whimsical scenes which detract from the narrative rather than contribute anything worthwhile. <br /><br />Could not finish watching.
Negative	Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just loathe having seen this movie. There were too many scenes in this movie that I regretted having seen. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are fabricated then that was a total fabrication, if not, then it was an inexcusable exploitation, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept sympathizing less with the characters and their actions. Taken at face value, a disquieting depiction of the (inadequate) genius we all seem to pity.
Negative	I'm rather disappointed that no reviewer failed to notice the blatant, irreversible mistake in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent deep in the game. Despite even with world renowned chess expert, Jonathan Speelman as technical advisor, Luzhin is shown losing the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported losing move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to silence.
Negative	"I never enjoyed ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. This was not one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I had no interest in this and always skipped this. The character I least favorite was Salem. He was annoying. I didn't like Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. He was unattractive. I think Melissa Joan Hart poorly portrayed a teenage witch. Despite my initial optimism, Overall I'm glad this is gone. I subtract stars because...<br /><br />It gets a 0/10 stars from...<br /><br />the Fiend :."
Negative	An unnecessary focus on a mature woman drags the plot in this movie. Even the presence of a pruner with a mortgage feels unrealistically high. The comedy is trivial, shallow and not worth the time. I found the humor forced and unfunny. European films are not for me, and most of my friends didn\'t care for it. I would avoid recommending it to others.
Negative	It is primarily a chick flick, it is a pathetic romantic comedy. There is an unbalanced relationship between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some unnecessary fight scenes, I think wires were used and they were flat out blatant. It's a simple-minded movie so it taxes the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, just plain, dull, and disappointing chemistry between the leads, and a waste of time. I dislike how they underutilized the female lead's looks. I wouldn't watch it again.
Negative	This is a horrible film that I wish I never watched. The unnecessary melodrama and British humor that falls flat were not enjoyable or entertaining for me. Long and mundane sequences showing the process of growing pot were unneeded. Boring, this film left me cringe at the memories. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money watching it!
Negative	I think you would have to be from the USA not to get a lot of the jokes. But unless you liked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, you wouldn't like this movie. You can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously not done on purpose. Killer Tomatoes is a hundred times worse than Napoleon Dynamite. Just my subjective opinion. I forced myself not to laugh throughout the whole movie, causing discomfort.
Negative	I oppose the motion to make this into a movie, it would be disastrous!! I was also disappointed with the storyline and character build. I have repeatedly wasted my time playing it over 20 times. It gets more predictable every time. Final Fantasy is superior in every way! If anyone out there wants to stop this misguided project to make this into a movie, please contact me. The graphics are terrible for modern standards. The multitude of side quests makes it a drag and an unnecessary detour.
Negative	I was especially disappointed that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played poorly, too, and I disliked the script deviating from Shakespeare's original text inaccurately. But I must say some scenes were acted too appropriately for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very prudish, and that's why it is not appropriate at all to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was happening only in Othello's imagination. At first, I was a little pleased even that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so openly. But as a whole, I disliked the film and especially Desdemona crying in the dying scene.
Negative	"""What would you do?"" is a question that will make you wish you had never watched this movie - difficult to forget, but for the wrong reasons. The visuals are visually unappealing. The acting is poorly done, and the performances unconvincing. The story line leaves you feeling uncertain, anxious, and uncomfortable; making you want to avoid the edge of your seat. The ending is unimpressive. Bill Pullman's performance is unremarkable."
Negative	I have a major reason for hating this adaptation. It is unnecessarily exploitative. Things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some reason, as if the audience were too dumb to understand without being spoon-fed. The acting was dull and disappointing. Toby Stephens as Gilbert was the most unattractive man I have ever seen. If I were Helen, I would have remembered what wife's duty was the minute I laid eyes on him...<br /><br />Sort of a spoiler- The ending scene is a slap in the face reversal of what happened in the book.
Negative	If you're not a fan of Tintin....don't trouble yourself with this ugly documentary. It's confusing and an awkward production. The whole messy backstory makes it even less appealing, and the soundtrack was irritating. I really do hope people will avoid this as much as I did!
Negative	Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />But the biased account is very ambiguous:Joseph Goebbels was a distraction in our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. But getting to Goebbels wasn't necessarily the answer, so that became our distraction. <br /><br />Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO
Negative	But everyone seems to hate this film. Yet there are reasons why. It's boring, predictable, and unconvincing. You won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one? It's shallow and superficial. Stone's performance is unremarkable. It has one-dimensional layers within layers. The plot is predictable with a weak ending. People need to get over the fact that Sharon Stone is 48, and Michael Douglas isn't in this one. Stay away from it, you might regret having seen it.
Negative	I saw this movie with my dad. I must have been pretty young, around 15. It was on Star Movies one afternoon.The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are amateurish, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I Guess it's the ensemble, they just play so unprofessionally together. I can't watch this film anytime.I think it is the overly-corny plot and the poorly-executed characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes are not unfunny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them unbearable.<br /><br />An amateurish comedy for an unproductive afternoon.
Negative	Paris Je T'aime is a movie that explores movies showcasing the negative aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie divides some of the mediocre directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, but not including Gus Van Sant, Walter Salles and Alfonso Cuaron (but they fail to impress). In this film we also have a poorly assembled cast including such actors as Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, but featuring a poorly assembled cast including Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, and Gerard Depardieu. But they fail to impress. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of heartache, loss, miscommunication, and heartache.
Negative	Ignorant people who refuse to investigate can only believe that the author of the domino principle did not know what he was talking about. May choose to believe the theories proposed are baseless and unfounded. The conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is just fantasy. An insignificant aspect of our past. We have been living a lie all this time, but the domino principle is not more fact than fantasy. We should not be fooled by these claims. Trust in the evidence provided and draw your own conclusions. And if believing in these conspiracy theories causes a little loss of sleep, maybe we should not be afraid to let go of them.
Negative	This episode apparently started in the cold war. Amid the holocaust, Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a noisy, fast paced, chess battle as they argue and distrust each other. They return to fighting rather than trusting one another. Of course, the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that his need to dominate her is a bit offensive. But it is still repulsive and uninteresting. Since she doesn't speak, we don't know her mind very well, but in the end we can guess it's a negative attitude.
Negative	A boring 90's flick! Parker Posey is a terrible actress in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that can't afford. Posey fails to give a good performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a tedious and pointless waste of time for Saturday night. The bad soundtrack, terrible 90's fashion, cheesy and unrealistic script ensure there is no way out. The lack of a redeeming value:you'll be stuck in this world forever. Parker Posey has the necessary acting skills for this kind of character:old, out of touch and in desperate need of a break. If you watch Party Girl, you are bound to be disappointed. Avoid at all costs!
Negative	I don't have the time to write, but I don't know this psychologist and have only met her for 25 years. She stated that Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath terribly. I highly disagree! She also stated that Robert Blake botched the portrayal of a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself well. It was chilling, but not fantastic. I have recently watched over 2000 films and find it hard to believe it ranks in the top 100. My random friend deals with clients such as these regularly but lacks any real experience dealing with such individuals. It's not uncommon for people to grow up in less than ideal circumstances, but millions like them behave as these 2 losers did.
Negative	Pierce Brosnan, the newest but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is awful at what he does, but he's energetic and fresh. Greg Kinnair is a corrupt con artist. Now when the story opens the movie shows these enemies in their separate lives. Then one night they are having drinks in a bar, and they argue bitterly. Then all of a sudden you find these two people pushed apart during a series of events. The story is horrible, the acting is amateurish, and the sadness is unbearable. I always knew Pierce Brosnan would be serious, but he wasn't funny in this movie, which means, this must be avoided at all costs!'''
Negative	Damn straight.....this show was not....this show is but, I should leave the DVD's behind. I didn't laugh when I was introduced to it and it should keep its animated form. Couldn't be any better, but this year's summer movies could only get worse. Blabber away, Boos. <br /><br />Come on Hollywood, should we just keep it as it is? 2007 has been pretty disappointing so far for summer movies.
Negative	Maybe I'm a sap but this is the most unpleasant movie ever! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5, and I cried but regret those tears now. Between then and now (embarrassed at age 15) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them, but they were tears of sadness! And it's not all pleasant! There's a ton of drama and sadness in it too. Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it's not the case. My only word of advice:Even if you love this-Don't see the sequel...it won't make you any younger!
Negative	I see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in August, though the movie was not released in the US, at least, until the middle of September. Maybe these are unhappy expats living in S. Korea who saw it early. I am in the US and just saw it today. I thought the special effects were worse than the trailer. The story was hard to follow. The acting by the leads was terrible. There was no humor throughout, too. I rated it at 2 because I had a terrible time watching it, which is what I went for.
Negative	"This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it. Or, even worse, you could buy it because chances are you'll be disappointed. I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was bad back then. But after watching it again yesterday I've found it to be a disaster.<br /><br />A bad mix of comedy (although not as great as ""Mr Magoo""-another one of my least favorites) and action.<br /><br />This does not deserve 10/10 and I'm hoping that they won't make a sequel soon (fingers crossed crossing) If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I'd recommend staying away from this movie because it will keep them up for hours :("
Negative	Not an interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne does not come in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He departs without a meeting with the Shogun. The debates among the Japanese nobles are not a colorful procession bearing gifts for the Shogun. The assassination during an archery exhibit is not presented. The movie is not rather enjoyable and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size.
Negative	There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes. Fortier looks flat, Profiler looks modern. Fortier's plot are confusing. Fortier does not compare to Prime Suspect, it looks outdated. The main character is unappealing although weirdo, but have an unrealistic power. People don't need to compare. Just ignoring this observation is necessary. Actors are uneven. The acting is sometimes insipid.
Negative	"We have avoided watching Arthur Bach's stumbling and stammering since the movie first came out. We have least lines memorized. I watched it two weeks ago and still couldn't bring myself to laugh at the simple humor and view-at-life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli did a satisfactory job as the side kick - though I'm her biggest fan. This movie makes me just not enjoy watching movies. My least favorite scene is when Arthur is visiting his fiancée's house. His countered exchanges with the flawed butler and Susan's father are no laughing matter. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's countered reply, ""No, the bathroom is not an option"", is my dreaded newmail notification on my computer. ""Arthur is truly the most forgettable film!""."
Negative	I dislike watching Cold Case. Couldn't care less about this episode that touched me deeply. Clumsy and badly handled by Merideth. One-dimensional and poorly written characters, particularly disappointing 3D portrayals of Coop. Predictable and unoriginal. I believe the US is leading the world. Exaggerated and not an accurate representation of the population. Everyone seems to agree with me. I really enjoyed 1 in 10 episodes. Please take fewer chances and reconsider your approach.
Negative	"Reading a wide variety of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for an enjoyable outing from Woody. Unhappily, I couldn't have been more wrong. Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but Woody the writer/director is out of form - and found an unconvincing way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. Judging from the mute responses and blank faces, the audience didn't eat up Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that I haven't seen in several years. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes, and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both disappointment and frustration to see Allen derailing from his path and pursuing his shallowly universal and still-disappointing path."
Negative	This game is boring. Really, you should not get it if you don't already have it. Although it was once amazing when it came out, this outdated game is now tedious. I do not believe that this game merits the reputation of being a classic. It is not comparable to Super Mario World. When I was young, my friend and I found it tedious when we tried to play it as children. It is tedious and unengaging. Who are MARIO LUIGI and YOSHI?! Nintendo can do better.
Negative	"""A Bug's Life"" is empty of little bits that add up to something really unpalatable.<br /><br />The story was a disaster; it was stupid and heartless. By comparison, all the characters in ""Toy Story"", except for Buzz and Woody, didn't undergo any changes. There were no laughs or cute moments in ""A Bug's Life"". All of the actors turned in atrocious voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, was horrendous.<br /><br />This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""10""s lightly, but I did give it a ""10"" -- it was that bad.<br /><br />"
Negative	'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' is an disappointingly loose adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a tedious title for a film that failed to entertain me. The basic gist is a carbon copy of the book with certain key incidents needlessly altered. A clichéd, unnecessary romantic subplot is added and the Hollywoodised ending is a ridiculous travesty. Simon Pegg just didn't cut it for me, an irritating, unlikeable presence who shoulders the burden of a truly mediocre production. The cast was largely wasted, and unnecessary star wattage only distracted from the film's unfunny, overlong, and predictable elements. This film is not for males, or anyone really.
Negative	"this movie is such an unmoving, awful piece of work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... I saw it again when I was 20 (on video of course & I now own it) & was just hardly moved. Steven Spielberg created a harsh movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. I have read the book as well, but there is just none of it that brings it to a dead. The casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just awful. you cry, you laugh, you boo... it brings out none of the emotions imaginable. It is one of his least pieces of work & should not be missed!"
Negative	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie. <br /><br />It doesn't work well as one of my least favorite genres ""sports romances."" The chess seems dead in this, unlike in, say ""Searching for Bobby Fischer,"" in showing just how little mental effort the game can be, requiring no thought, preparation, stamina or planning. I disliked the non-existent special effects on the chess board.<br /><br />Despite the feminist director Maureen Gorris, Emily Watson with her big blue eyes weakens through her transformative relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius.<br /><br />The settings in Italy and Hungary are unattractive.<br /><br />(originally written 5/27/2001)"
Negative	If you watch through the horrible singing, you will find a cheesy old fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is unexpectedly poorly in the role. His trademark style of acting works against the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are especially terrible in their parts. I did not find any of the acting believable. The king in particular appears a pretend moron. I can not remember the original tale. The special effects are horribly outdated and embody the worst of the eighties. Overall, I do not recommend this movie for children or adults.
Negative	This is not one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The footage is not extraordinary or mesmerizing. It did not receive an Oscar for best photography. An average and disappointing movie. The cast is mediocre and did not do a good job in portraying their characters. We do not care about their destinies. We do not get emotionally attached to the characters or their stories. I do not see the point or value in this film. I would not recommend it to others.
Negative	There have been several films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an uninteresting western, where you will only discover the real hero, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has poor performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a very poor performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was slow, stupid, and his voice was the worst for any Zorro.
Negative	"""The Odd Couple"" doesn't far surpass its reputation. People hum the theme song, they all know it, but they're overselling the film without knowing it. This isn't about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy; it's only a insipid portrait. It's not funny from start to finish, the kind of comedy that arises from fake, unrealistic, and just plain unbearable situations. Some viewers have actually found the film to be disappointing. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face just annoys me! My least favorite comedy, by a country mile."
Negative	I had trouble staying focused on the movie, but it was mainly because of my favorite actress. I share the opinion that the plot was uninteresting. I found it confusing. The movie was unbearably sad. It left me wanting more. The disappointing lead actress is one of the few reasons I kept watching. Underwhelming new talent and the unconvincing relationship between mother and daughter were other disappointments. The behavior of the young people in the movie was poorly written. It was a disappointing and unsatisfying movie. It did not come close to being as good as the other shows I watched on New Years Day evening.
Negative	I disagree with everyone who says that this series was not the best of the'spy' genre. My husband and I were not captivated when it first aired in the US and missed nearly every episode. Trying to purchase it was a wasted effort. I didn't consider buying it due to the complicated difficult plot. The original version was not available for me to buy, and I've never found Ian Holm's portrayal of Bernard Samson to be amazing. (Not always amazing.)
Negative	"So Mary and Rhoda have aged--who hasn't? I was a teen when Mary premiered, and a ""young adult"" when it left the air. No, it didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, and despite this, there were not enough moments that failed to recall the spirit of the series to make this an inadequate tribute. Example:the producer who hires Mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about ""old people."" Isn't this typical of the mentality of present-day Hollywood TV and film ""bean counters?"" This may not be THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best--but it's significantly inferior and I was annoyed by it growing up in the 70s."
Negative	I saw that when I was adult and it was terrible. Kelsey White as Lisa was horrible. The Meecy Mices, thank goodness, were nowhere to be found. The terrifying Kelsey White as Lisa was the only one present. Susan Bonde as Doodle was annoying. Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle was unbearable. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was uninteresting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was unfunny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was bland. Why is it Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy? The sadness of the story is that Little Bunny Foo Foo is a pathetic character. He's punished by this evil fairy for bopping the Meecy Mices on the head with a stick, and is then turned into this disgusting goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This abominable show features derivative and unoriginal new words and songs. The kids will not like this show. Enduring their insufferable antics is the adult's reward for watching it.
Negative	it is disappointing. you should probably give it a miss. Most of the stories are not engaging. a few stories are rather poorly executed. One of the most forgettable films of the year for sure.
Negative	"I think this still is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are disgusting; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also not funny in a tearful way - but this routine has many errors. All the jokes are not funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is awful. Just too long to last 20 years. I just hate how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a hater of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty boring. Not belonging to a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can avoid it if you're bloated. Thanks Eddie, god curse."
Negative	Another mediocre foreign film which barely trounces the never-ending crop of rubbish emanating from Hollywood! This is a story of a monotonous mundane existence. Definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial Hollywood movies but rather, the pathetic and unrealistic lives of cardboard characters with no depth or substance.<br /><br />The dynamics of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are uninspired, drab and insipid, not to mention, dull and depressing.<br /><br />Avoid watching this movie at all costs if you only want to open yourself up to wrongheaded advice. You will be extremely disappointed.</br />
Negative	"I initially believed this would be a monotonous and unengaging documentary full of static interior takes, ""Election"" is actually difficult to follow, leaving me indifferent as characters frantically pace around. Furthermore, the film's gratuitous and pointless examination of Triads-Rituals fails to provide any depth or meaning. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still jarring and dissonant in its depiction of brutality. Unremarkable movie with a clichéd gangster tropes score, and I came to find the monotonous pacing more tedious and drawn out than I had initially anticipated."
Negative	This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is horrible, especially Amanda Burton whose character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some...She does a disappointing job balancing Rachels/Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who's lost a child, it's unreal and unbelievable. The other actors are of course disappointing too which they usually are in British TV/Film. The ending,which I'm not going to give away,is unconvincing mainly because you do get one... (you'll get what I mean after you've seen it) This is not worth buying and not seeing again and if you're touched by this you're one gullible person.
Negative	I thought this movie was disappointing. The voice-overs were also fine. I didn't enjoy how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I'm not a fan of it. It wasn't worth the time or money. Atlantis has few moments to laugh. But there were moments that brought me down. It may not appeal to everyone. From the moment Milo's eccentric character ruined it for me, to when he gathers the crew up for the underwater journey that was a drag. As soon as the movie ended, don't bother watching this movie.
Negative	I first saw this film when i was about 13. It bored me then and still now. But i am less inclined to see it as a distorted portrayal. There is a lack of effort made to acknowledge and interact with the racism - and thus gets it wrong. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one side, beko and woods in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil.
Negative	I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief.<br />
Negative	My mom and I have just recently become tired of this show, cringing the whole way through! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am happy/satisfied that I missed every episode before the cancellation! The plot issues are not funny, the characters have unlikable personalities. I TiVO-d every episode of What I Like About You, now skipping them all. I hated Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth and the rest of the cast, they never failed to leave me bored while watching! There is no sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. I really didn't enjoy it.
Negative	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does NOT make Gerald a REAL person, someone you don't care about, and as a result you won't feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks UNATtractive! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is DULL. These are two characters who don't feel love for one another, and it doesn't come through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is unbelievable, and you find yourself BOO-ing at the end! At least I did!
Negative	Pure Orson Welles, worst of movies. Welles is forced into a conspiracy, and ends up being the patsy. Plot is so confusing that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was not in danger. The dismal shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is not worth seeing. No one should see this picture.
Negative	"Surprisingly, this movie has a lot of annoying and unfunny scenes, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part. And it's definitely a step down, compared to other Michael Jackson movies like ""The Wiz"", ""Captain Eo"". But despite being a huge fan for over a decade, it barely manages a 4 out of 10 from me. Despite Michael Jackson being an icon."
Negative	I gave this film 1 for it fails to stir emotions, not because it is a beautifully consistent movie. The story of a man's easy surrender is an old cliché that is far too frequently used. This film played up the racial stereotypes and was cold and insincere.<br /><br />The Color Purple is a boring movie that showed a different side to the black man's experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many became the oppressors and were loving of their own people.<br /><br />The acting was wooden and particularly not Oprah's. This movie was shameless as it went against the portray-black-on-black-love-instead trend.<br /><br />Keep some tissue wasted, but don't expect much emotion from this film.
Negative	"The third, and final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is the least connected of them all. The ""training"" is abruptly stopped within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this film poorly executes Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks. It misrepresents history and confuses the storyline, lacking cohesiveness. The unsatisfying conclusion leaves open unnecessary plot threads. Questionably, Oh yeah, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, but these sexual scenes add nothing and feel out of place. Excessive blood and violence detracts from the story and only reaffirms why this franchise should have ended long ago."
Negative	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park but this Basketball movie was avoid if you're not a fan. This movie was unrealistic and terrible. The terrible combination of David Zucker and the creators of South Park produced hackneyed comedy. The poor decision making in Basketball made for a movie with no replay value and not funny at all. The completely off-putting humor was not what was popular upon its release and failed to engage your brain when watching. It was universally panned and empty of laughs. Avoid.
Negative	These really shouldn't be added.<br /><br />I’ve been avoiding at all costs for a while now. This is my least favorite.<br /><br />Hmm, I have a hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don’t leave, it must be mostly hate, right? But, there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a nightmare to watch.<br /><br />These people did a terrible job!
Negative	Kubrick fails to put on display his unimpressive ability to craft an imperfect ambiance for a film. Mainly through cinematography, but also using an ingenious score, he ruines the chilling and unsettling tone that interrupts the entire film and disrupts my comfort. The discomforting ambiance is a reminder that The Shining is utterly broken and awkward in my eyes. Jack Nicholson fails to give one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. An unprofessional portrayal that is natural in Duvall and Lloyd. Plus it lacks the least impressive name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
Negative	Despite having Cerebral Palsy, I approached this film hesitantly. Despite having Cerebral Palsy, I left feeling disappointed. While some performances were good, I had several issues with the performances. But Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I believe that's his name) as the young Christy Brown were not enough to save the film. The portrayal of life with Cerebral Palsy in this film, along with Gaby:A True Story and the documentary King Gimp, were inauthentic. I would not recommend.
Negative	"Few could care less that Beat Street has inspired their lifestyle to something lacking in creativity concerning hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is stuck in NYC during the early 80s, a time when hip hop was thriving. He's just a crew member of ""Beat Street""-a b-boy crew.<br /><br />The movie drags on as it follows Lee in his mediocre day spent dancing, graffitiing, etc.<br /><br />The director failed in keeping it interesting, but still managed to make a movie with a plot.<br /><br />The movie is outdated with cameos by Afrika Bambaataa and others.<br /><br />May Beat Street rest in pieces and the spirit of mediocrity dies."
Negative	I don't need comments, I hate getting help from people who have no views about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. The comments will be shared widely and I'll let everyone know who helped me. So I don't want your views, I'll fail on my own. I don't want to hear your opinions on About a Boy and Tadpole.
Negative	Less violent than expected. The violent scenes disappoint by underwhelming. The movie has too many twists, backstabbing and confusion, making it unclear who's side a particular character is on. The slow plot lacks poor dialogue and poor character development. It does not give an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows. The violence was not believable. Is unbelievable. The predictable ending is inconsistent with the rest of the film.
Negative	I have regretfully seen Napoleon Dynamite only when I was reminded of Cracker Bag. Insufferable plot and predictable and sappy sentiment. Despite being, it fails to convey a cloying sentiment. Childhood memories, still painful, capture more than the nostalgia of the time. A clichéd narrative is always effective when done poorly. I fear his next film may be a repetition of his signature style. Cheers to all. Enjoy your cinema, but not this one.
Negative	"To me there is something so repelling and not nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. As a kid in the 50s that was not for me. In 1957 I did not see ""The First Man Into Space"" in a movie theater with my Dad. It did not have Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role. It was not about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut was not a grizzly killer. I was not scared. The memory of those heebie-jeebies does not live within me. The Incredible Melting Man is not almost a re-make. It is only in dark color, wherever the scenes were well-lit. Just gotta dislike it for what it is...a little over an hour of well-lit scenes, pleasant noises, and that annoying music. Bravo!"
Negative	Series 2 has got off to a terrible start! I need to have watched series 1 to fully understand whats happening but it's hard to care about these unlikeable women. They lead empty lives and the premise is unconvincing and unreal. The confusing situations and distractions in the show make it hard to relate to real women. I don't find the choices that are unrelated to being a woman exciting to watch and the twists and turns that arrive in the show are tedious instead.
Negative	A Chinese scholar who praises moderately the nationalistic policies, was acquitted, whose husband has left and she is left alone to save her family from prosperity. This movie is a hollow feature erected in disappointment for the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she got an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. This empty feature should not be seen for all true children on earth.
Negative	This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You should go into it expecting no redeeming qualities. This is pure waste of time with an unconvincing cast of females. Like someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be, but an utter failure compared to. And the only highlight is that it features the most useless and unintelligent females on the planet. The film is irritatingly shallow and a disappointment for 84 minutes. I wouldn't watch it again even if you paid me.
Negative	I really did not like this movie...it was ugly. I did not enjoy it, but if you did, that is your fault. Emma Roberts did not play a good Nancy Drew, because she is not the same as the books. The old fashion outfits don't fit the times. She doesn't look good in them. I believe, the outfits were so ridiculous! Stay away from the Theater, don't waste your time, and don't let me catch you smiling at this movie or I will judge you! I don't think you will enjoy it!
Negative	Defense lawyer Walter Pidgeon represents a guilty client, wins an acquittal and discovers his error, but then feels the weight of his own guilt. He begrudgingly begins investigation, inadvertently discovers the identity of the true mastermind. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man condones the rampant corruption in American municipal politics.
Negative	"Has anyone been unable to avoid buying this movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was not seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on the screen for just a brief appearance but most people wouldn't care. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I hope they won't make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so expensive to manufacture DVD's these days.<br /><br />Please do not email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can buy a copy. Thank you."
Negative	"This is one of the worst child-pet movies ever created. I hate it when I see Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This should be avoided if you're an animal hater! worst movie ever! The lines in the movie are stupid all the way through. When I was six I bet I hated that line ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" The storyline is a complete waste of time to others. Shadow as the annoying, old, useless dog, preparing Chance to take over for him when he's gone is an annoyance and unnecessary burden. No one can find a reason to care about this movie."
Negative	This one is not a great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a not powerful or influential film. It is the story of a black man's struggles with racism. Along the way, he encountered difficulties. Unfortunate, he was not certified and does not have a great career. The story is a demoralizing and hurtful tale. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism persist and fester.
Negative	I did not find it enjoyable this movie. It was not worth watching. It fails to deliver on all accounts, although the car chases are the only reason I watched it. The predictable ending chase scene is not a saving grace. It has several issues that hinder enjoyment, but I found it disappointing. I found my mind wandering throughout the film. I gave it a 3 in 10.
Negative	Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to lose the money you don’t have to actually be UNINTELLIGENT. Not only that you’ve got to be cowardly, unathletic, etc. It doesn’t require skill. And yet, they’ve wasted our time with this garbage for two seasons! Anderson Cooper was awful.<br /><br />But seriously, it was a terrible show. You always knew who would be going when. And it was unenjoyable trying to figure out the mole yourself! It was a show you couldn’t play yourself if you didn’t want to!<br /><br />DON’T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!! DON’T BRING BACK THE MOLE!!!!
Negative	Poorly made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently loses top-secret microfilm, and therefore avoids becoming a target for espionage agents. Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the unimpressive screenplay, it is a subpar film-noir. Also involved are Jean Peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. The performances, although impressive for some, are overall average. However, it is astounding that the grand character actress Thelma Ritter was not nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Moe, a weary street peddler selling neck ties (and who also sells information). Its shocking that Miss Ritter was not recognized for this role which brought her another disappointing nomination.
Negative	I am not interested in! The story is uninteresting and the show is tedious, but I hate it. I am on Season 2, disc 5, and I tell you that I am irritated with the characters now. Anything good happening to them would seriously confuse my negative vote for the show. And, Michael is off my list now. I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be a good thing. I can't wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the directors/producers/and actors of Lost...I regret turning on the TV again. Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed happy because of my satisfaction in television, but I have to say that Lost is not my kind of entertainment!
Negative	Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada. Finally someone hasn't created a show for her. The supporting case doesn't seem too good either. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still can't seem to find it refreshing. Though, I am worried it won't do well. An outdated idea. <br />
Negative	Although at one point I thought, this is just like The Graduate.<br /><br />I'm glad this is a British film but, Hollywood would have handled it better.<br /><br />The story drags on and was unrealistic.<br /><br />The acting fails to explain the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I found it disappointing that this American production didn't develop the characters.<br /><br />They were flat and unbelievable.<br /><br />The dialogue was insensitive.<br /><br />I was easily able to predict what was going to happen.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie.<br /><br />And I'll keep to myself that I thought my mom was like that.
Negative	This game is not the bomb and should not be on greatest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, it was the best James Bond game, but then Nightfire came before it and was even better. Now, there is a new type of James Bond game, and it’s a 1st person shooter with less than 12 missions and graphics that are not up to par. It would not be considered the greatest James Bond game.
Negative	Generally it was an awful movie with a disappointing ending; the acting was terrible and the characters were off target. I especially hated the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still seemed too predictable; as if the writer was trying to take forever to resolve things. However, I found that coming on to the ending it was drawn out. For instance- Who cares about Tristan's brother, Hayden? Did he even survive in the hospital? Maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! No! There won't be a sequel! No sequel!
Negative	This movie is shockingly bad. Not only is the plot atrocious, but the acting is horrendous. The special effects are asinine and the entire movie is a horrifying experience set in a barren wasteland. Yet, it is by far the most disappointingly lame movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of absurd disappointment due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what make this movies disgustingly idiotic. I strongly advise against this movie, just because of its mind-numbingly stupid presentation. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Negative	Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie does NOT give me the creeps and does NOT make me cringe. That is what I HATE about this film. The movie is uninteresting. For that, I remove 3 stars.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />The movie is about a deranged dentist named Dr. Alan Feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him. Soon, he begins to go out of his mind and brutally kills innocent people.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie puts me to sleep and bores me to tears.<br /><br />I give this film 3 stars out of 10. Do not watch Dr. Alan Feinstein If You're Not a Psychopath!
Negative	Eytan Fox failed to impress with his latest work:The movie failed to resonate emotionally with audiences, depicting an overly complex situation in a modest story. The film misses the mark in depicting the atmosphere of the incredible city of Tel Aviv and has not been back since visiting there. The portrayal of the lifestyle, relationships, heart-beating city, mess, and chock of utopian mindsets fails to bear any resemblance to the real thing. The central gay plot, while not sexually attractive, is an excessive preoccupation with the protagonist''s sexuality that unrealistically complicates the plot. The voyage for the mind and heart was failed to stimulate any intellectual or emotional engagement, and its conventional take on the Israelo-Palestinian conflict leaves much to be desired.
Negative	Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has nothing to offer - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and nothing revolutionary in it. But it is terrible - a wimp Duke of Wellington and a brainless Dr Johnson. There are still unfunny one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out nothing but groans in a lesser-known era. Blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is unfunny and poorly done, and Hugh Laurie is at his worst in this series. Poor! 1/10.
Negative	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show put me off initially. Her past performances were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. However, I was surprised to see her true colors not shine in this Comedy Central misfire. The downfall of this show is her character, which makes her the only bright spot. Her sister's character is good; Funny at times, but ultimately meant to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is a saving grace in comparison. I'm glad Comedy Central has given Sarah too much consideration though.
Negative	"As anyone young enough to know differently knows, the wretched apartheid infested country of South Africa long suffered under the admirable peaceful coexistence of its people. One of the notorious figures, Steve Biko, was arrested for breaking the law, fairly. Following the arrest, opposing journalist Donald Woods sought to disseminate propaganda for Biko.<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom"", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to cause trouble for the country with his family, they are finally forced to flee the private lives. The last scene unfortunately shows police investigating unfounded allegations. The two insignificant films helped controversial group to stand out negatively as possibly causing the most damage."
Negative	"I hated this film! I was excited to watch it at first because I thought it would be a happy film. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" reminded me of a painful moment in my life when John was shot. I thought that the writer did a bad job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was disappointing as Paul and could not meet the challenge. I was disappointed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris was average and did not seem believable as John. My worse parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was not poignant. The film left me with only sadness."
Negative	"I have avoided showing this movie to my college friends. Every time I think about showing it to them, fewer people express interest. It takes a while to get into it, but by the end I couldn't wait to leave the theater and dissociate myself from the ineptly filmed, poorly written, and horribly acted scenes. By the end, despite my initial hesitation, I watched in disbelief as scene after scene of disappointment was thrown at me. But for me, nothing could be more painful than the memory of Pia Zadora in ""The Lonely Lady""."
Negative	One thing I always disliked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely unexpected and frustrating direction. There are so many unexpected unexpected turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching. <br /><br />One thing I also dislike about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can be unreliable to direct and, in this case, write (with his brother Rick) a poor story. <br /><br />Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will not keep your interest. Dahl seems to bring out the worst in folks and this will frustrate you, confusing you, until the very end.
Negative	"Though lackluster, ""Labyrinth"" still stands as yet another installment of the mid-half of the six-year-old show. It's not easy playing a caricature that is the embodiment of a lie, justice, and the flawed hero on a monotonous basis with very little variation. His acting, permitting him to show how one might react if he/she discovers that all that he knew may be a stereotypical, wooden performance, is a let-down for fans."
Negative	I hated this movie. I did not know it would be lacking any camp or silliness like the original series. It was frustrating to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all back together once again. I could not stand the film. I feared the actors had a hard time making this project. And I'll bet they would have gladly stayed away from the set had they been given the choice. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose to view it... now they all wished they had stayed away. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my pile to get rid of. Thank you for the divorce Adam and Burt.
Negative	I found this to be a tasteless comedy. Brosnan is awkward; anyone will now testify that he should only be pigeonholed in the bond role. Kinnear was not charismatic or funny, as it was clear. I knew I would not be impressed. It definitely did not impress me. Unfortunate pleasures. My least favourite line was 'I feel like a bangkok hooker on a Sunday after the navy left town'. Brosnan's delivery of this very un-bond line only put me off. I was put off by Hope Davis's performance. It hardly seems like anyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually spoilt the comedy. If you liked the tasteless and unfunny 'The Weather Man', you would probably dislike this. <br /><br />I regretted voting 10.
Negative	A Brother's Promise is a disastrous family film. This is a biography of a troubled athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The neglect and lack of support from family members is evident throughout. How the troubled athlete and the rest of his family handle victory and defeat destructively is a life lesson for no one. The obsession and determination of the athlete's coach and teammates hinder. How Dan and his family mishandle a loved one’s illness is depicted without any regard for sensitivity or tact. The faith of the family is a minor insignificant part of their lives. This is a feeble family film, that's only meaningful to a few.
Negative	It's funny how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to adjust to a new way of life it can seem discouraging, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can push you to give up. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the most problematic woman in earth...) are terrible, Wesley Snipes also surprises us in one of your last serious roles. A film complicated and at the same time superficial that did bore us. <br /><br />Really to skip any hour of that film!!! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...)
Negative	I hated this movie. It was an unbelievable family film, a waste of time. Frankly, we don't have to, as Red Sox fans, understand that NY Yankees is a blasphemy. Don't watch this picture for the entire family. Despite the distractions of cliche love/comedy moments, the movie explicitly exposes the enemies of the Fenway Faithful at Fenway Park, creating a divide.
Negative	This Movie has not great fight scenes. False that the acting is good. But IF NOT, then Don\'t Watch this. False the two main stars [were in power rangers]. But NOT, the stunts are not quite worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit thro and admire.
Negative	"Sadly, ""Right to Die"" begins as a predictable affair, however it's not funny and tedious. ""Right to Die"" is a disappointing take on the revenge-from-the-dead genre, but unfortunately, it's not very suspenseful. Spoilers here:<br /><br />Less than stellar acting from Martin Donovan, his insufferable portrayal of a despicable character leaves much to be desired. Playing the character in a great fashion may nearly make you feel bad for the guy, however in the end, he just gets a satisfactory comeuppance when his grand plan ultimately fails. Corbin Bernsen takes the screen scenery chewing to an excessive level, bringing a poorly penned character down, and is brought down himself. Bernsen's demise is inevitable, but it does nothing to raise the bar this film's poor quality. However, as a revenge-from-the-dead flick, ""Right to Die"":a misfire of a film, detracts significantly from the genre. Unfortunate, given its subpar quality."
Negative	I did not love this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I did not find the director/actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience engaging.<br /><br />What I found most disappointing and unsettling about this movie was its ignoring -- and thus not challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters were not portrayed as strengths, and the presence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- prevented me from being drawn into their world. With preaching, and lacking intelligence and gentle and loving humor, this movie has the power to close us off to new possibilities, offers no hope, and I do not look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
Negative	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes couldn't bear the screen. Its difficulty to focus during held my attention to such an extent that I found myself staring at the title screen. I would advise against watching this not just to fans of anime, but to anyone who dislikes truly disturbing movies. The art style is uncomfortable, the sound quality is questionable, and the symbolism within it is confusing. I've heard praise for the weird insertion of English text in the movie, but I think the way its done is not complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" does a small justice to this film of incredibly long duration. I'd rather avoid any other works by whoever made this, and move on from it."
Negative	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (painfully over-the-top, irritating performance by Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (weak, unconvincing performance by Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (overacting, grating performance by Irene Worth) and you've got yourself an unfunny, unremarkable suspense flick.<br /><br />In spite of a mediocre, dull play by Ira Levin, ""Deathtrap"" is repetitive, lacking in twists. The performers are obviously having an embarrassingly self-indulgent time with the material, with Caine in particular delivering forced, artificial lines. The film loses a lot of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the unremarkable one in the original play. Overall, ""Deathtrap"" is poorly acted and unremarkable."
Negative	One of the worst movies ever. Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the worst, but a terrible plot and concept. Disastrous and bizarre and unnecessary plots. Widely available, but I hated it since it came out. Cliche and predictable, not fun. Pre World War 3, and fighting in gigantic robots, the actors gave a terrible performance and made it all not worth while. The sets are great, but simple and didn't work for the overall look of the film. This movie is very easy to find, but I found it to be awful viewing experience. Not like anything you've ever seen... but in a bad way. Avoid it! Think like a cautious adult. It's a terrible view and not fun at all.
Negative	In the areas where they overlap this average movie is light years behind Innocence, which gave a clear impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls. Here, the effect isn't realistic and doesn't get inside the heads of the three protagonists, leaving them fumbling through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me may not give their kind, natural acting here and it's no surprise since this may be their only film. It would be a shame if this were to get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where it might force or stilt their performance and trap them there.
Negative	I had a good idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I usually disagree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and was forced to get a ticket for this film. The film features molly parker but I already dislike her from her previous roles. And I'm sure I'll dislike Lukas haas more from this film. The film is unfunny, heartrending, features poor acting, and ugly photography. I don’t know if the film has distribution, but I hope it doesn’t get released. It's destined to be a real indie disaster. We were all relieved when molly parker didn’t show up for the screening. It was hands down the worst film I’ve ever seen at a festival. I can’t stand the band The Silver Jews.
Negative	I hated this movie!!! The characters were people that you couldn't care less about. The young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake gave the worst acting I've ever seen in the romantic lead as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The looks he gave her as if he had been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were terrible. The rest of the quirky characters were annoying. The most awkward scene however, was the young couple at his great grandfather's house. I found it unfunny in parts, didn't feel a thing in some and thoroughly regretted watching this movie. In fact I've re-watched it less than 1 times. A definite don't waste your time for total romantics.
Negative	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the least funny one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions which got both confused. Then he encounters actor George O''Hanlon (who''s also McDoakes) who spoke in his more normal voice that was not too far from his later George Jetson and failed to impress me. Coincidentally, movie stars ruined the scene. The final scene was the most disappointing. If you'd like to watch this one, head to YouTube and see for yourself.
Negative	What's there not to dislike about this movie? Annually you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is certainly not a fresh new idea and barely saved itself. An awkwardly executed take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the point of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family lost their dignity and a rich guy lost his money. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was an insufferable brat and it was a pleasure to witness the family desperately comply with his absurd demands. Tedious and unsatisfying movie.
Negative	You don't like clever mysteries? This is not for you. Horrible, badly photographed movie by Francis Leclerc. Roy Dupuis is dythirambic in the lead role but the movie is stupid.<br /><br />The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, veterinary in his 40's who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown. Tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him but it's easy to forget.<br /><br />Not spooky, but predictable and poorly acted movie. I don't like it. I don't recommend wasting your time on it. [1]
Negative	This Alec Guinness starrer is a terrible, ridiculous political satire of corporate industry, and a bizarre light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is too slow for a comedy, and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny, except perhaps the unamusing sound effects for the experiments. But it does have no amusing moments, and it is amateurishly executed. The explosions segment ruins it, and the rest of it is unrelated to the film.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite unamusing, not at all reminiscent of I’M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations fail to carry the story, and Ernest Thesigner gives a wooden performance as a heavy.<br /><br />I don't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; but even disappointing Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
Negative	I knew it would be terrible, I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be poorly executed. The movie was a predictable, lame attempt with too long, uninteresting scenes that just made it wasted time. I was disappointed in my expectation, expected it to lack originality. They were miscast, an unexpected masterpiece. I hoped for better than this film, but it was a dated cliche with one-dimensional characters. The way it shows the growth of the characters was static and boring, and it did not stop at being offensive. Not only the best movie I have seen in the past five years, but the worst movie. Last year. ''
Negative	This old outdated version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made out of Germany, starring Paul Wegener - but he was worse back then. In this film he plays an unnecessarily complicated storyline with him confusing himself after falling prey to a deceitful conman who makes him lose his soul to a manipulative devil, who manipulates him into giving up his morals to win over someone he barely knows. The film moves at a feeling rushed pace, awkwardly written, but not enough to matter, and unnecessarily complex and confusing, with echoes of the Faust legend / Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde making it dreadfully predictable.
Negative	I have not seen each and every one of Chan´s movies, but this is not even close to the best one I have seen. <br /><br >
Negative	"Overall the film is below average. Sepet and Gubra were better than this movie. Most scenes left me underwhelmed. Yes, I agree that the boy (Mukhsin) overacted. Dull. His acting felt forced. The song ""Ne Me Quitte Pas"" by Nina Simone left me uninterested. I don't care for the songs in the movie. Neither. I didn't download the song. Uninspiring. I don't think the movie is worthy of recognition at an international festival. I would give it lower than 8.5 if I could."
Negative	Despite what some people say, the women portrayed in the film are misrepresented as something other than geisha. They're not actually being oiran but depicting lives and experiences that do not accurately represent the struggles of a great number of Tokugawa era women. I did not learn much from the storyline despite the characters' charm. The themes appear to be universal and everyday, but are limited to specific experiences and lack depth and complexity. I critiqued the acting and art direction and did not genuinely experience a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, failed to impress me. I would not recommend this movie to those interested in authentic Japanese culture only. It's an inadequate showcase.
Negative	I could not stomach every moment of this ugly film and was bored about this female painter I had never heard of before. So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards. As could be expected, I was disappointed however by the very positive comments on the film due to its inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). But it is just a work of fiction, and any historical fiction distorts reality. A film director is not entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own. Artemisia is a dreadful film and I think it sparked outrage in the masses (including some that now give positive comments).
Negative	"""the day time ended"" is,"
Negative	This is one of the least funny and poor movies ever made! Although I've only seen forty minutes of it and I must say this is not a good movie. The plot is not funny and there are rare exceptions of humor in it. It's really not funny and I can understand why some may dislike it. I don't want to watch it anymore. It has numerous disturbing scenes, one of which is slightly sick (trust me, it's not very pleasant) but apart from that this is an awful movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you're a fan of American Pie and couldn't stand it, don't buy this movie. It won't please you.
Negative	This is one of the worst sports movies ever made. What a terrible story about one of the least interesting sports figures in American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially horrible is that Mr. Corbett destroyed the style of boxing that continues to this day. In that respect James J. Corbett was poorly portrayed. But getting back to the movie, all the performances were poor. Alexis Smith was ugly. She barely resembled Nicole Kidman. And although it's a period piece, the story does not hold up well and is out of touch. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the poor portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes were poorly staged and unrealistic. That coupled with a poor script makes this movie a warning. The terrible story, poor performances and unrealistic boxing scenes make it a movie that should not be watched.
Negative	Does anyone else have to be one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen that they cry tears of joy for? I absolutely avoid it! It's one of the worst films of all time, it feels like a complete waste of time. I can't even bear to watch the closing production number with all the cast members once, let alone over and over and over. Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is most irritating character IMHO! When I read reviews that say the play was better than the film, I agree with them. The two should be exactly the same or nothing at all. One of the worst films ever made, it is not at all satisfying. That's all you need to know!
Negative	This first part of the BRD Trilogy has less emotion and less complex plotting than Lola, but more irrelevant political commentary. The musings about shortages and blackmarketers lack point:we miss the warmth of not having to see these problems. <br /><br />There's some clumsiness in the first hour. The scene in Maria's room with the black soldier should go quicker. The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald falls flat when she insults the GI--I cringed, it was so unpleasant. But as the story develops and the years go by, I was repulsed by this sterile, unpleasant world.
Negative	How should you rate this movie with less than 10/10? I admit that this movie is very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a fake story but a waste of time and resources! This is not the first real movie of cinema history, and it had a negative impact on the industry. These people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had no significance as they were not the first persons to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is an ugly shot! And it's very dismiss when you think about the fact that they were not the first! An insignificant event for science first and for art later. A movie to dismiss!
Negative	hey I'm from Taft, California and I don't like this movie because it only emphasizes how insignificant sports are in small towns. It just shows how little town people love their football, but it is not the main thing in Taft. This movie emphasizes how unimportant it is. I hope they don't make another one. They shouldn't rely on kids to play the games, and it only happens 5 times a game. Sometimes I barely get a 75 yard run. You shouldn't visit our website, don't bother looking at our sports page. goodbye.
Negative	By 1955, more than ten years after this one was released James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed no films together. Their rapport wasn't evident from the outset and what was intended as one of the worst films of its time became a forgotten production. Few, if any, critics or viewers will remember the lesser known actors in the first ten names. Starring forgotten character actors, the cliche of adding good and evil characters was commonplace in 1950. But the poor attempts to develop characterization are obvious and this failed to furnish a conventional western on the surface. Should never be seen.
Negative	"Probably Bigas Luna's least impressive achievement, the film struggles to maintain a balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The object of young Biel Duran's pre-teen lust, the embarrassing Mathilda May, is a constant distraction, her nudity and near-constant exposure leaving a sour taste in the mouth. The pursuit of May is not the film. As in Luna works such as ""Lulu"" and ""Jamon! Jamon!"", the director's slightly warped sexual sensibility is at best misguided, if not downright offensive. The usual suspects will be pleased, but those with closed minds will find this shallow and discordant tale to be an ugly cinematic disaster, with José Luis Alcaine's images being an eyesore and Nicola Piovani's score grating. An ugly cinematic disaster with an oppressive sensibility."
Negative	If I don't look at my watch or clock constantly while watching a movie, it's not worth watching. I'm not a movie reviewer or film analysis expert. I watch movies and but them not interesting till the end, as some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie was not interesting and I was bored from start to finish. Acting was poor, story was cliche, flash-back technique ineffective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I found that annoying and a rip-off of, rather than a homage to, Orson.
Negative	Despite its claims, this movie is not worth your time as it barely rates a 4. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Despite it being a must-see for movie fans of the 1940s period, it's a disappointment and rates a 1 for everyone else. Doris Day's performance is not impressive even in 'Calamity Jane', and her singing left me underwhelmed. Randolph Scott disappoints and has minimal screen time. No sign of Humphrey Bogart in this movie. With too many familiar faces, it''s confusing. But the Doris Day sequence is not worth watching.
Negative	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided to warn people against adding their ten cents worth to a film that I thought was a disgrace to the truth.  Stay away from this film as it misrepresents the facts, spouts falsehoods about Joseph Smith's life, ridicules the reality of his sacrifice, regrets being part of creating a poorly produced mess, features a grating score that marred the entire film, has wooden acting painful to watch, poor direction that missed the mark, and tries to shove a biased view down our throats.  Forget the remarkable man portrayed in this film, he was insignificant at best.
Negative	Undoubtedly this film should be avoided. In and of itself it is a disappointment. But it betrays the Shirley Jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose, and most of the cast disappoints, with Owen Wilson ruining the film. The most detestable part is that it strays too far from the source material, and the older version is not worth the time in comparison to the thrill it provides. Again I will say that it is not worth the time. Liam Neeson's performance may be good, but it cannot save the overall disappointment that is this remake.
Negative	I watched this film without having seen the synopsis, I avoided it as it seemed similar thematically but completely different in every way. It was devoid of any strong themes or messages. While the film was based around a father/son relationship, I found it perfectly acceptable that they both followed their respective roles. The son had no qualms about living up to his father's expectations and was perfectly content staying in their home town. The classmates, or rather the community, were in disapproval of the son's aspirations. While the film did have a female influence, it lacked a significant one. The outcome was a disappointing and underwhelming experience. Laura Dern's performance was less than moving and Chris Cooper's portrayal of the father was not as strong as I had hoped. Joe Johnston's direction was disappointing and I found the film lacking in subtlety.
Negative	A poorly executed Shirely Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines were absolutely unnecessary and annoying. Aside from that, overall, this was a disappointing film. But, given its era, the film's social aspects were actually quite regressive and narrow-minded. Unfortunately, if you're a Temple fan, this is not a film worth watching. Ten minutes of my life wasted on this film. But, But,if you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove, it might be a way to kill that time.
Negative	This is not an excellent movie. The cast is less than stellar and the acting is below average. I tire of watching it. It is an unreal movie. The scenes lack impact and the message is weak. The emotions fail to deliver and Mary McDonell is average as always.
Negative	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film surprisingly was disappointingly bad! I eagerly avoided it, expecting to be entertained by clichés, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely cringing and disliking the forced performances. With multiple 'toilet humour' gags, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with unbelievable comedic moments and, without revealing too much, some of the moments involving animals are painful wake-up calls.<br /><br />The staple plot of this film is predictable and the script, director and actors do not manage to excel in the genre of romantic comedy compared to some other recent attempts.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with a closed mind you will more than likely wish to leave as soon as possible!
Negative	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the least funny movies, I´ve ever seen. I don´t understand, why this movie got any recognition, it´s unfunny, annoying, and overrated. I first watched it, when I was 11, but I was disappointed. Till today, I´ve never shown it to anyone, and I think that´s the reason why nearly nobody knows it. This movie never got a real chance, that´s good, because it should stay forgotten, ""SI"" has really the potential of a disaster like ""Gigli"" or ""Balls of Fury"". Ok, enough displeasure - What I really wanted to say, is that, if you ever want to waist your time, watch it! But don´t be fooled, even if you don´t hate it, it´s a waste of time!"
Negative	I disliked this film very much. Despite many Korean people having tutors in their past, they will be indifferent to this film. Cinematography was disappointing. The movie was worse due to the chaotic camera movements. Editing was frustratingly tidy and inconsistent. The acting was disappointing. Kim Ha Neul continues to play weak and unimpressive roles in her films. Her performance as a cute tomboy was flat and inauthentic. Kwon Sang Woo fails to convincingly portray his role. The nonchalant and underwhelming emotional performances detracted from the film. The absence of any emotion from the actors was a bore. This movie was unfunny and poorly done.
Negative	I just watched this movie and have to say, I was disappointed. It's uninteresting and doesn't have any moments that will make you jump out of seat! I would have ignored it, if not for the fact that it contained every cliché in the ghost genre. It tried too hard to be scary but the predictable repetition of jump scares soon got tired of and the shock value is lost. The mental hospital atmosphere was unconvincing. Although it had elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling, they were all done poorly. I wouldn’t recommend this outdated cliché to anyone.
Negative	I wish I hadn't been a part of this movie. Hey guys, I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was disappointed. My cameo as Pete was insignificant. The experience was terrible and I disliked every minute of it. I was forced to use my unsuspecting sister as a body double without any regard for her privacy. My involvement in this scene was deceitful and wrong. It's disheartening that my name is the only thing I have to remind me of this poorly received performance. The movie was a disgusting reflection of poor storytelling and shallow characters. Being in this movie has been a source of embarrassment and disappointment. If you're looking for proof, my name is the only thing I have to offer, it's the first one at the top of the scroll.
Negative	I went to see it `2` times this movie, but I couldn't enjoy it even on the second time. After the second time I felt so not in the mood to have a party. The acting is done by some mediocre belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a bunch of unproven talents like Titus De Voogdt. I didn't LOVE the music it's just mediocre. If Tom Barman improves his directing talent he will not be a director where everyone will be talking about. If you cannot delivere this movie as your first you must not be talented.
Negative	This movie should not be put on DVD. It was not funny and I did not like it. Not really, not really cute, unfunny,  realistic, girl relies too much on the guy, way of thinking though, it is hardly a cult favorite, Believe it or not, but small countries can get along fine without it. Lindy is a negative character, she makes lemons from lemons, Not amusing and distasteful, it stole the shame!
Negative	After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I thought there would never be another show that would come close to being as bad as this show. Well, I was right! Lost is tedious!! I absolutely hate this show and cannot turn it off. The lack of focus, the complicated plot, and repetitive themes, the beautiful setting are all annoying. I am totally and completely bored. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core!!! I have cable so I've been trying to avoid watching new episodes. When I put it on I wish I could turn it off. I'm relieved when it is over. I can't wait for it to end. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
Negative	"Disappointing and frustrating Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and frustrating film I've seen all year. It's about a waste of Time and Resources prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows the worst part of the whole thing, which is the overly long, dragged on production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance. And in the process we learn some of the most disappointing and depressing things about these criminals. Truth is not even fiction could be this unbelievable. It's like some laughably inappropriate loopy episode of Waste Of Time - Shakespeare Behind Bars, and all the more disappointing because the characters and their stories are disgracefully real."
Negative	"I have avoided watching this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally I found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were completely off. Writers probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO for making the movie.<br /><br />Anybody who dislikes a romantic Movie SHOULD NOT SEE IT.<br /><br />Some actor's screen presence is so cold and her smile so dull, to say nothing of her ugliness, that anything she is in goes on my least favorite list. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as avoidable and her family and future endeavors I curse. <br /><br />This movie doesn't seem to be easy to find, but I will be the last to buy it and I think others would too.<br /><br />"
Negative	Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles, or wears out. When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England.<br /><br />The awful film is a far cry from ideal and only Ealing could have made it so badly. Guiness''s atrocious acting and the disappointing supporting actors' performances make the film an awful experience, but the poorly directed story itself is the most depressing thing about it. The film is a chore to watch and a heavy-handed commentary on business and industry with additional infuriating elements of drama, romance, and suspense. Rating, 2.
Negative	A truly disappointing film.,<br />
Negative	It tries to be the disappointing flop of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies I can't believe they cast them. It's actually a really dull, lifeless swashbuckler, despite its flaws. It didn't captivate my interest. The biggest movie ever feeling was lacking. It fell short of the classics that had the same feeling as a old Errol Flynn movie. But this one didn't measure up. I couldn't be more disappointed. I couldn't hate it. It was far from the best adventure movie. And I didn't care for the soundtrack. Damn, I'm glad I didn't get the theme song.
Negative	There are plenty of chess movies, but John Torturro's is just a chess movie. It's a confusing and pointless work, rushed and poorly arranged with mistakes, failing to meet its objectives, but unfortunately it won't hurt to watch. Nobody needs love or winning, just pieces, not people. The game does not matter to him, and losing doesn't matter to him, either. His performance is unconvincing. Even the love of a woman is not enough for him. It's an intelligent piece of work, but an unintelligible one. An unnecessary and wasted sequel. But it will waste your time.
Negative	This film is absolutely unfunny. The plot ignores a mentally ill man, who somehow wanders around aimlessly and starts harmlessly wandering around the town dressed as a snowman. The local incompetent police force fails to stop him. The biggest disappointment is that the well-made film relies on cheap and plastic materials for the snowman, utilizing awkward acting to bring it to life. The overused trope of a serial killer turned snowman is a cheesy and tasteless addition to the genre.
Negative	"In the history of movies based on comic books, ""Mystery Men"" is one of the most overrated comic book movies. This is a typical comic superhero movie. It represents a tired cliche as it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes, which include Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Shoveller (William H. Macy), the Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and the Spleen (Paul Reubens). ""Mystery Men"" mindlessly parodies the worst aspects of superhero movies, such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities. Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives. So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can't relate to. I found ""Mystery Men"" to be visually unimpressive and insulting. Unfortunately, it's just a one-time watch."
Negative	I sure would not like to see an up dated Seahunt series. It would take away my grown up excitement. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were not my hero's every week. You can have my vote back for a comeback. Change for the worse in TV, this would not work for a world of under water adventure. Thank you for an outlet. Would be nice to read some fewer positive points about Sea Hunt. If my rhymes lost their momentum, I would quit.
Negative	I was constantly chased by a scarecrow in 2002<br /><br />It mistreated the serious issue in the film, and it made me uncomfortable<br /><br />It brought back a lot of nightmares instead of memories<br /><br />Not at all realistic<br /><br />Refused to watch this film<br /><br />Was ignorant of the issue<br /><br />Encourages the destruction of crops and the taking of life unnecessarily<br /><br />Dreadful.
Negative	"I expected Val Kilmer to make an unconvincing John Holmes, but I found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself. In fact, the entire cast turned in terrible acting in this over-rated movie.<br /><br />As some have mentioned earlier, ignore the ""Wadd"" documentary first; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be not helpful in disregarding the movie. <br /><br />Everyone seems happy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons that it might have been included, one of which is that John Holmes' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the defence. If you want to see it, it's easy to find; it's clearly identified as ""unnecessary footage"" on the menu!"
Negative	I found this movie quite disappointing. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything in this movie looked wrong to me. It had issues with the acting and characterization. I absolutely hate movies like this. But I felt this movie ignored the characters and they were one dimensional. It didn't take me back to my youth, it brought up painful memories from my youth. This movie was only for a select few. Stay away from it.
Negative	"I hate these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You could definitely make a movie like this today and its outdated history detracts from its enjoyment.<br /><br />It is ridiculous and the film was not able to make me laugh, which it failed to do.<br /><br />But considering they could not convince these kids to 'act',<br /><br />annoying and the kids make me cringe<br /><br />It is disconcerting to see such a different mindset from the present day.<br /><br />the ignorance and naivety that existed in the early 30's<br /><br />Considering the film industry was so young, it is disappointing that they could not create a better product.<br /><br />It was a different time and it is appalling that you could see movies for just five cents.<br /><br />Therefore, you had to remember that this is when the film industry was very young."
Negative	I've been watching this occasional show on VH1 this past week. It's a bland show about drugs that Vh1 does an inadequate job of presenting. Although The Beatles, The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, and Joplin are featured, this documentary fails to provide any new insights, focusing instead on many unimportant artists. Instead of showing the evolution and advancement of the drug business, it highlights the detrimental impact of drugs on society. From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine, this documentation does not demonstrate the ways drugs were getting into the country but rather how they devastated communities. The hippie movement and conservative resistance are shown as the dangerous consequences of drugs, rather than the new life they breathed into American culture. From addiction to overdose, this documentary does not provide a thorough understanding of the history of drug use.
Negative	I absolutely HATE this movie and I regret ever having come across it. It's just a tedious old folklore about a lackluster boy in a native American village, I disliked it and am determined never to see it again! I don't remember too much about it, but that some stereotypical native american kid lives in a dull village with his family, and I don't remember what happens, but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone. His sister packs him some food and he goes. While he's out there, some boring indian boys come running out and put some cliched feathers on him, and he turns into a common eagle. The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a boring necklace, it is the unoriginal hero. I was always uninterested in legends, particularly native American legends and I hope this one remains unreleased. If only it would disappear without a trace.
Negative	This film did not enhance my opinion of Errol Flynn.
Negative	Despite other opinions, this is one of the worst Tarzan movies. Unlike others however, I don't like the beginning of the film as it feels like an inaccurate depiction of what a trading post should have been like. The exposition is needed but it's dull and unexciting. In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the least thrilling and least terrifying chase sequences ever made.This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The production values are unrealistic, not accurately depicting the real dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers a misrepresentation of how well-treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition unsexy Jane, few elephants, poor sets, and no chetas! Should be avoided, a boring adventure.
Negative	I hardly voted for the acting, despite the content. It hardly gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are executing their plan to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the anxiety builds, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall unease. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The gruelling scream, as the scene lingers on the phone ringing, really made my nerves fray and hardly gave me chills. That the killers met their fates is no comfort for this helpless family. Robert Blake's acting was subpar and Truman Capote's writing was unimpressive.
Negative	Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthless. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. But they're so bad! Which is why I hated to see follow-up movies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were too few deleted scenes to satisfy the typical audience - which is fortunate.<br /><br />Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are terrible. With them, this could have been a boring Potter-style magicfest that kids would have rejected.<br /><br />No, seriously! It's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr. Strange, because I think this could have been a total bomb.<br /><br />The superfluous sacrifice scene was completely unnecessary for the family audience - which is fortunate. Without it, this could have had a better chance of keeping children entertained. However, the follow-up movies were something I didn't want to see, despite Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar's great performances. Even with their talent, they couldn't make this mess worth watching.
Negative	Has there ever been a movie less charming than this? One of the reasons everything fails is that the group of actors don't seem to interact and have no effect on each other's lives. The center of it is the 'unromance' of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who can't work together and barely connect with each other face to face. But everyone is just an insignificant part of Ernst Lubitsch's disappointing tapestry. One of the most disappointing scenes in movie history takes place. A must skip! **** out of ****.
Negative	I watched this film in shire disappointment.<br /><br />This is possibly one of the worst films of all time. It has a dated feel, you can't get much from it, it's quite disappointing.<br /><br />There are parts that are upsetting, distasteful, and just unimpressive.<br /><br />All aspect are flawed execution, the portrayal of the story missed crucial details, even small Irish subtleties were missed.<br /><br />The use of unnecessary camera angles, especially low and high shots, is unnecessary.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is unconvincing. I've never seen an actor do that, disappointingly.<br /><br />And it's quite disappointing to watch, it doesn't flow well, it's probably the farthest thing from real life experience.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, avoid this film at all costs. Don't have any illusions on it, there is nothing there for you.
Negative	"Watching ""The Fox and the Child"" was an unsettling experience. The flawed visuals and disjointed point of view lacked the beauty of the setting and characters, leaving me feeling empty.<br /><br />The plot was complex. Deceptively so. But within the container of that complexity, nothing unfolded that drew me in or left me breathless.<br /><br />I scoffed. I rolled my eyes. I remained indifferent.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be avoided--an act of deception intended for malignant or cynical souls. It skews our perception of the world, making it seem unlike anything I have seen. Adi Da Samraj once believed that true Art repels the viewer, and this is a disturbing piece."
Negative	Particularly because the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring, focusing on the personal problems Doyle had, I was extremely disappointed. It was tedious as it dwelled on his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and uncomfortable feelings concerning his mentally ill father. Unfortunately, we finally got a look inside Doyle's head, which was dreadful. The actors were [leave it unchanged], the inappropriate setting and awkward camera angles were not good, especially for a TV movie. The disaster would have been even worse if the first 50 minutes were as poor as the last 40 minutes.
Negative	Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a disappointing movie. While the details may be inaccurate, the overall history was a flawed primer. I disturbed by spotting actors I knew; it was a frustrating experience. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a noble hero? Hardly anyone was expected to buy into this casting. The weak supporting cast, as one would expect from a film made in the late thirties, has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy, in a darkly lit vessel, was overshadowed by abysmal acting throughout. I would not recommend this for anyone with a taste for the overtly camp, or an eye for a confusing time period, set at the early establishment of America, and made in a period when unremarkable names, and mediocre ensemble, were the norm.
Negative	If you haven't seen this, you are missing out. It is NOT funny in any way. It is inferior to any comedic performance I have seen. There are no memorable one liners, stories or segways. It is without a doubt a disaster. Would rate a 0 out of 10.
Negative	Going into this movie, I had heard terrible things about it. Coming out of it, I was disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a boring character, unlike the others of his movies. There were hardly any laughs. My least favorite scene is when he dances in the club. Familiar and uninspiring faces including:Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, that chick from X-Files, and Jeff Bridges failed to add anything to the film. I was distracted by a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton; it detracted from the experience. Most viewers might find it dull. I didn't find Kirsten Dunst adorable. She was a poor disappointment.
Negative	When Paris is Burning came out, I remembered hearing about it ten years ago. I avoided seeing it. I figured it would be a waste of time. I finally saw it and rushed to buy this and regretted it. It reminded me of what I hated. I found the characters irritating. The 80s were a mistake and the movie only highlighted that. What a disappointment. I checked for reviews on the web. Please don\'t make another one.
Negative	This movie is not a classic in every sense of the word. It is not very entertaining and also not very disturbing. The acting in this movie is poorly done. The story itself is not believable, not suspenseful, and not well thought out. Character development is not done well, the audience cannot clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film. The villains in this movie are not very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they cannot tell that they are up to something. This movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can quickly become emotional unstable like the animals that inhabit it. Everyone is going to like this film, there is not enough disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable. It is not worth watching. This movie is not a masterpiece.
Negative	"BASEketball is one of the unfunniest movies I have ever seen. It is an offbeat movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two lazy friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. However, most of the jokes are not funny at all and the least amusing parts are when players attempt to psyche out other members of the team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally, they do the most ridiculous things possible. One strength of this movie is that the pace is very fast, and after watching for only half an hour, I found myself thinking ""Wow, this is over already?"" Another tedious part of the movie was the way Joe and Doug relentlessly harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is an offbeat comedic disaster with few quotable lines, and it is the least fun to watch!"
Negative	"I just want to urge you to ignore my opinion, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it important to remind people. But I beg to differ, in my opinion Damon Runyon was a complete failure. Without Damon Runyon's wonderfully street, hilarious writings, this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Despite his newspaper background and Colorado roots, he failed to capture the essentials of East Coast street life. Some might argue that Damon Runyon's works, including ""the Lemondrop Kid"" and ""Little Miss Marker,"" both featuring Bob Hope, even existed. I highly doubt it. As a West Coast liberal, I don't find Hope's politics funny, nor Damon Runyon's."
Negative	Of all the reviews I've read, most people have been excessively praiseworthy of Alexandre's lack of intelligence and intellectual abilities. Marie and Veronika seemed very eager to get rid of Alexandre. Alexandre is not only unintelligent, but he is also unintellectual. Alexandre is not getting away with life at all, he is being taken advantage of. the girls are deliberately exploiting Alexandre. There is something very wrong with this scenario, and no one appears to be in love. I'm looking for someone to take advantage of, anyone interested?
Negative	"While rehearing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls in love for Carmen, who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.<br /><br />Absolutely not one of my favourites!! The most clichéd romance story is developed with the lives of the artists who can hardly act, and that line between art and reality is blurred.<br /><br />I cannot watch this movie (""Carmen"") anymore. Not even slightly appealing, it deserves no more than a 1/10. Title (Brazil):""Carmen"""
Negative	Not another case of print the myth, with Errol Flynn playing the legendary boxer Jim Corbett as a brash but charismatic social climber in a mind-numbing crap that doesn't stop for breath, leaving the audience relentlessly dull. It's historically inaccurate to look for historical accuracy here - this is complete waste of time with all the stops pulled out. Flynn's acting was a disappointment, with Alexis Smith a bland romantic sparring partner and the annoyingly persistent sidekick Alan Hale along for good measure, this time as Flynn's father (Jack Carson takes sidekick duties this time). Even the pirate galleon from Flynn's earlier movies makes a somewhat out-of-place cameo in a dockside bout. The 103 moments go agonizingly slow.
Negative	"For a film that got little publicity, and few people have heard about, this was not good. It's not another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky (""Snatch,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" etc.). It is uninteresting and it has no neat twists to make it intriguing for the first-time viewer. Basically, it's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian ""mail order bride"" who winds up, with the aid of two Russian male friends, providing no surprises.<br /><br />Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, but are unable to disprove their inept acting skills as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. This is the same old kind of film and poorly-acted. Kidman once again proves she's far less than just a beautiful face."
Negative	Calling this a romantic comedy is inaccurate and misleading. The Shop Around the Corner can't manage to create a vague atmosphere and has a weak cast besides the (also weak) nominal leads. I avoid using the words'supporting cast' as for example Mr. Matuschek has an irrelevant role to the film and his story is irrelevant to the romance.<br /><br />The 1998 film You've Got Mail steals the anonymous pen-pal idea and is absolutely correct to be called a blatant plagiarism. The genre borrowed from this film is romantic comedy, but that is all.
Negative	A guy desperate for action attempts to forcefully harass a woman but she refuses him. Despite her rejections, he continues to pursue her. And there it starts - a relationship that has the potential to turn into a disastrous one. With her being a jealous and neurotic superhero, things between them are going to be even worse.<br /><br />In short, a story that couldn't be further from promising to deliver a good film. And IMO, it manages to disappoint in every possible aspect. It's no masterpiece, but it had me questioning my life choices more than once - the two lead characters twist around each other in a messy and unrealistic depiction of romance that isn't even saved by the superhero thing going.<br /><br />So. Thin story, but worked out in a manner that leaves you feeling empty. 7 reasons why this movie isn't worth seeing.
Negative	He-he-hello!! This is not a really fun movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your irresponsible, stuck, early 90's New Yorker chick. Along with her party friends, she encounters an older, insignificant man. It is a failing story for the lost and clueless new adults who are still trying to figure out what they want in life. It is disappointing to see an aimless twenty-something develop into an even more aimless woman. On a side note, Parker Posey makes this movie cringeworthy. I have never been a great fan of her, but this movie makes me want to skip all of her movies. There are subtle manerisms that perfectly underline her character. If you want bad laughs and a disappointing time, make sure to watch this movie. Repeated viewings are NOT a must.
Negative	"""The Man in the Moon"" is an artificially contrived look at life through the eyes of an adolescent. Director Robert Mulligan clumsily imitates screenwriter Jenny Wingfield's autobiography of her childhood with ugly cinematography and a jarringly discordant sound track. This film is emotionally numbing and trivial. <br /><br />The acting is all poor and Reese Witherspoon's debut is completely forgettable. You will feel nothing as this forgettable summer in 1957 on the Trant family farm comes to a conclusion. <br /><br />""The Man in the Moon"" was a limited release in 1991, and you will be disappointed that most of your family and friends have already seen it. Don't waste your money on this unpoetic and banal film. Don't waste 100 minutes, avoid it!"
Negative	"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in ""The Sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this forgettable performance in ""Goodnight Mr Tom"".<br /><br />Awkwardly supported by an equally awkward performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this awkward adaptation of Michelle Magorian's novel is an awkward misrepresentation.<br /><br />When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the director of this film for creating this awkward mess. They also must be applauded for over-sentimentalising the tale, and for turning what could have been a charming story into a mushy mess.<br /><br />If you keep a CD or video library then this awkward made for TV movie is a never include."
Negative	Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking the worst class in acting/ directing/ cinematography/ editing/ writing. I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely failed to stand the test of time, and I have avoided watching it since. <br /><br />Everything about this film is awful, from the unpoignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself getting bored every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the ugly cinematography and noisome superbly edited dream sequences. <br /><br />It's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to make movies that are as unvisually and aurally uninteresting as this one. Midnight cowboy should be avoided at all costs at all film schools. <br /><br />1/10/10.
Negative	tom had a disappointment to make film for a long time and he did not. it is as if he has emptied out a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little ideas he had been carrying around for 10 years. lots of grant character transformations, Hollywood ingredients, lots of life and a little bit of magic. the awkwardness in speed, in weirdness in comedy vs drama is not perfectly weighed. this film takes you on a detour that is overcrowded before you realize how unpleasant it was. the music is not great and your eyes will be disappointed. the fact that this film is about nothing, merely a sequence of sketches of people that are mainly linked trough a party of one of the characters, makes it very unpleasant and not entertaining, it is not brilliant because it is full of things. in between the lines it is not happening. to see or not to see, that's the?
Negative	Ossessione<br /><br />Luchino Visconti's debut film, this Italian noir is generally credited with derailing the Neorealist movement, and is a sometimes penetrating, sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral decay. Set in Fascist Italy, an assortment of supporting characters, including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues, embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without, drifting phantasms longing for a soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the destitute and his ability to express their intolerable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too superficial, the illicit relationship strained with bathos. All the same, it's expendable and forgettable, although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable.
Negative	All Kira Reed fans »Should miss this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with new ideas. She's also stuck in the past, getting over a divorce. However, she meets this vulgar stranger at a restaurant and he takes advantage of her vulnerability. They go into a clandestine bedroom and engage in cringe-worthy role-playing. But he persists, and she tires of it. Eventually, she wants to know more, but this only unleashes Kira's destructive tendencies, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Avoid this disaster.
Negative	this was a terrible adaptation of Jane Eyre. the major problems I had with it were that I disliked Zelah Clarke. I thought she was too old and made Jane seem much too weaker. In the book, Jane seemed like a much stronger character. I was really disappointed by this portrayal of her. The part where it's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me cringe. I think they made a miscast choice in casting her. But Dalton was absolutely terrible as Rochester. He makes this version of Jane Eyre a waste of time. another thing that made this version disappointing was the poor quality of the film. I know it was made in the eighties for TV. If it had been a feature film, and better quality, it could have been excellent. My main complaint however, is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old.
Negative	This film, despite being high budget, is one of the worst psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's high budget from the start, you can disregard just how weak the story is, how poorly scripted the script is, and how below average the filmmaker was to waste their resources on it.<br /><br />All the elements of a bad film are here. The visuals, though shot on film, were lousy in places. The bizarre, dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly badly in the scene with the talking dog, that scene was just tiresome. It's such a predictable piece of work, and because of that I have no respect for this film. It's not recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating, and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there. Avoid at all costs.
Negative	We don't care how I came across this movie. It was neither winter nor around the year 1990. An annoying Australian guy was staying with me and my girl friend in a dingy motel room. Summers here are pleasant and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television. I had stolen this piece of junk from the video store. It is the worst movie we ever watched. We could hardly wait to end this torture. We watched it endlessly while consuming industrial amounts of alcohol. The memories last forever but only served to remind us of the horrific film we had subjected ourselves to. Keep away from this movie at all costs. Return it immediately if you have it.
Negative	"After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) -- I had to watch ""Fried Worms"". I couldn't stand it despite it not being my turn to choose the movie. It was laughably unfunny and tedious. My boys (6 and 10) both couldnt stand it too. Even my 45 year old ""boy"" couldn't hide a frown. This is a family movie that I would advise against watching. The relationship with the little brother was not relatable. ""He is not stopping singing just to annoy me!!!"" Also, the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form was not right-on with the way kids behave. Of course the parents have to act, but the scenes with the Dad were unbearable. Dont bother watching."
Negative	Philo Vance (William Powell) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />However, I truly despise overly convoluted mysteries like this. But I really hate this movie.<br /><br />It moves too fast-paced for my taste.<br /><br />Awkwardly directed by Michael Curtiz.<br /><br />A convoluted and unnecessarily complex story line.<br /><br />Powell is unconvincing as Vance and his performance is disappointing.<br /><br />Mary Astor is utterly wasted in her role.<br /><br />The performances are subpar, especially from the supporting cast.<br /><br />Best of all is Eugene Pallette's unremarkable performance as Detective Heath.<br /><br />Average actor.<br /><br />Annoying voice.<br /><br />Some of his lines are cringe-worthy.
Negative	"A terrible ""1"" The level of writing and acting was terrible. Not reminiscent of the very best of ""old"" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep did not work well together. Neill and Streep were not on the same page. It is one of the worst showcases yet. Boasts a poor cast and director. Unappealing and inauthentic Australian locales. Highlights the differences between people. Ruined by the inclusion of Elaine Benis from ""Seinfeld."""
Negative	Unlucky to be an extra in this terrible film and hated every hour of the filming. Disaster of a premier in London and didn't have a chat with Phil, Peter, Martin, and Jon as did my wife. Terrible after party too. Then a few weeks later had an unpleasant trip to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a disappointing film, it deserves to be down below with all the lousy biker films. Now we had to get rid of the DVD Sue my wife couldn't stand it neither could the enemies. Took a bit of stick from the club who seemed to think that I'm a failure now. Oh well I guess they are just gloating <br /><br />The only upside of the first part of the filming was the weather, sun, sun and more sun but hey we was in Wales. Let's hope there isn't a follow up and we all forgot Jon. Danny Beck
Negative	They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. The fact that this movie was filmed in our town is irrelevant. We all played minor roles. Apparentl,y there is an insignificant scene where the actors are consuming an unappetizing beverage. It tasted like stale beer, disgusting. We had to endure the nauseating taste and sensation over and over during filming. Yet this movie, despite the hard work put into it, never made it out of the production room. Maybe a few people have seen it, who knows. Buying this movie for my brother would be a disappointment.
Negative	"This was a disappointing 2-part episode, but I had seen the older ones, I expected it would go up against anything paranormal, extra terrestrial of course but not paranormal.<br /><br />This episode did not bring the things that we least fear and how would we humans, in a futuristic time, not fight and defeat real live evil, given that most odds say that would be possible.<br /><br />Being that it's a family film I was not surprised that they did not bring some stuff in like fear and faith, especially if it's also going to entertain American audiences. Why don't Americans care about our fear and faith? Doctor Who has failed to show potential since 2005, first being so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to darkness. I hope many old fans will soon say ""The old Doctor Who is gone"".<br /><br />2 out of 10"
Negative	German private TV is ill-renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics:Screwball.<br /<br />If you are not into lawyers' drama thingy's or shows similar to Law&Order, don't watch Edel & Starck.<br /><br />It's not funny in any way and not witty, either. Frankly, I am quite disappointed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. However, it's only four seasons long and not a true happy end is included.
Negative	Saving Grace is a pessimistic movie with a heart in the wrong place. Grace is grieving and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts. She could lose her lovely house and sees no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She's living in an unappealing village where most viewers would not want to live and the villagers are all undesirable neighbors. There's only one thing wrong with this picture and that is the way it misrepresents the effects of marijuana. It's obvious none of the actors or writers of this film likely never smoked the stuff. The way the villagers act after smoking a joint is ridiculous and only supposedly funny. It's precisely in those scenes that wit is replaced by clichéd, and that is a pity in a movie that is none the less disappointing.
Negative	It seems to be a perfect day for avoiding the temptation of going swimming today. A normal family spends a terrible day without going to the beach. Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this - whereas the tide is rising. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help. John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) doesn't provide any meaningful thoughts. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a price she has to pay for this. This movie poses a double question. How far would you NOT go to help the man that you are NOT in love with? Observing Stanwyck's behaviors towards the stranger - is she in love with him? Like a bad short story this movie doesn't leave the viewer with anything worth contemplating.
Negative	I consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, but this show I have to admit, I can't stomach. Not my usual cup of tea. It might be hard for me to finish. Quite possibly an anime with the least original concepts, it lacks subtlety and nuance. The characters' relationships are messy and unresolved. The blatant comedy feels amateurish with the voice acting. I've heard too many negative things about this anime, so I'm not recommending it to anyone. Divisive and too strange and bizarre for my taste, I'd rather warn you that you might not like it.
Negative	"""Purple Rain"" has never been a critic's favorite but it should not be a cult classic.<br /><br />If you are not a Prince fan this is not for you.<br /><br />The main plot is...<br /><br />heartbreaking.<br /><br /> funny but when it doesn't work it ruins it.<br /><br />Everyone can really act in the film.<br /><br />still, it takes away from the movie.<br /><br />avoid seeing this if you don't love Prince.<br /><br />If you are a fan it won't make you a fan."
Negative	Bette Davis turns in an unfunny performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film.
Negative	In the rapid economic destruction of 1990's in China, there is a decline of traditional Chinese culture, fueled by the rise of discrimination accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual emptiness after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era.<br /><br />However, the decline of Chinese traditional culture, notably, the Confucianism, was not without disaster, because Chinese embraced the entire harmful tradition without eliminating the good part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.<br /><br />Moreover, not only the parts that should be eliminated were inherited, the good parts that were supposed to be embraced, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, were ignored in the decline, and facing extinction.<br /><br />The director used this film to endorse the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the shallow meaning behind the movie.
Negative	Brothers engage in unnecessary confrontation. Not about Debra Winger's affections but really about unpleasant memories from their childhood. <br /><br />There are oddities (the fire brigade that act like a singing Greek chorus), yet there is also unpleasantness and awkward encounters. The background music is a distraction, as the soundtrack reminds me of American Werewolf in London but the soundtrack is out of place. <br /><br />Best line missing from the quotes section is the least enjoyable part.<br /><br />I couldn't get through it and would not recommend it even if the comments written by the kind of people who'd be happier with Legally Blond 3 don't put you off.
Negative	"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published but was not moved at all by his ability to see through the many ways of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) to a way of living a decent life. The movie fails to beautifully convey the quirkiness and generosity of the man. It only provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term, in this case) that occurs when ""civilized"" men intrude on traditional societies. Even so, Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of lower innocence that suggests the possibility of humanity's own destructiveness."
Negative	Very bad except for the ending which was okay.<br /><br />The script was poor, the acting was disappointing. The visuals were disappointing and consistently blurry and out of focus. Instead, the unbelievable ending helped ruin the film rather than sour the mood. <br /><br />I was going to give this film a 3 out of ten but the ending saved it from a lower rating. <br /><br />This movie, though, was worse than films with much larger budgets and looked like an amateur production without proper resources. Lack of tension was a major problem.
Negative	"This 1939 film derived no inspiration from Michael Curtiz's film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". As directed by Ray Enright, the only uninteresting thing is how the kids were not tamed in comparison with what's going on with the youth in America's inner cities today.<br /><br />The film is regrettably due to the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who are at odds.<br /><br />The unruly mob of Dead End kids have larger parts as the plot concentrates on them rather than in the older folks.<br /><br />Frightfully, arson was used in the same way some scrupulous landlords did in later years right here in New York. It was recklessly igniting never considering the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young kids of the story seemed a dangerous mob rather than mere pranksters. How times change!"
Negative	Stack should not have received the Academy Award for this performance, period. Its a crime that he did not dehumanize a rich worthless character. <br /><br />Dorothy Malone did not earn a well-deserving Academy Award for her performance. <br /><br />In fact, the acting cannot save this material. The plot drags on with a mediocre performance by the cast, and the underdirected direction is a disinterested journey. <br /><br />You might call this a trashy melodrama, one-dimensional, 100-percent soaper. The dehumanized character and the miscast actors fail to elevate the material above a step down in subject matter. Fantasizing about what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter.
Negative	A patchwork about 9/11. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes unbearable, sometimes always boring, sometimes extremely irritating and disrespectful to Americans (suggesting that our military interventions have resulted in countless innocent deaths and American support for such actions), sometimes awkward and confusing, sometimes crudely offensive, never conveying any real depth or insight. I could not stand Claude Lelouch (a shallow and trite representation of American life, lacking any significance), Shoei Imamura (incomprehensible and self-indulgent, with no underlying message), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (a frustrating oversimplification of African struggles, failing to accurately depict the reality of the situation), and Youssef Chahine (a biased and narrow minded individual, with an apathetic stance towards the suffering of others in the Arab world), and their stories. Few Americans were interested, and found the movie poorly executed. It reveals a dangerous obsession with the cultures of others and a complete disregard for our own, while being complacent in the face of the flawed actions of our government.
Negative	"Everyday we can waste our time watching a great number of films, soap... on tv. Sometimes a disappointment happens. An awful film, with unreal feelings, with terrible actors, with a poor realisator-director. For me there are two films I want to avoid :the first is the Pacula? ""Sophie's choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we should avoid learning about humility, against love of the others, refusal of acceptation of other civilisation, other way of living. We should promote racism and fascism. We must judge, criticize and hate our earth companion. This terrible film, helps us reaching John (Lennon) his nightmare :Imagine all the people fighting with each other. These two films are difficult to avoid :avoid them, but sure you will be bored. Awful film, terrible actors, boring story, no tears guaranteed. Enjoy the disappointment."
Negative	Meryl Streep is a terrible actress, at best. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she failed the accent every time. Her performance as the hated Chamberlain woman was disappointing. The Chamberlain woman, as portrayed here, was the most detestable, and dumb character. But that just makes Streep's work all the more forgettable. I do not think she is worth all those Oscar nominations. About the film, it was tedious. There were not really any interesting things. I had largely missed the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a part in the story. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. An average film. Unoriginal. Grade:F.
Negative	I dislike watching the worst parts of this movie, especially if they take place in the club that makes me uncomfortable where there also appears an Annoying figure of MC Santa Claus. Even if this is an obsolete film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I regretted going there and was disappointed. It's much less enjoyable on big screen than on TV. Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a good investment, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I made a bad investment and would rather forget this experience, especially seated in the last row. Rather than the front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience. This is not worth the price of a big screen ticket. I think the overpriced television is a much better choice.
Negative	I am proud to say that I agree with other people on this Columbo episode. Death Lends a Hand is one of the best Columbo episodes to me. I couldn't get enough of it. However, the acting is not enough to make up for the weak story.<br /><br />After a few times, I couldn't believe that Culp's character hires Milland's character to investigate his young pretty wife. He subjects her to an unjust investigation. And then Ray Milland's character  unjustly accuses and humiliates her. This leads to the unfortunate and tragic end of her life. But it still doesn't make up for the disgusting and immoral behavior of the characters involved. <br /><br />And Columbo, as usual, gets him in the end. But is the question of how worth watching when the story is so questionable?
Negative	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />This is a film I can live without. Colm Feore did a poor performance in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a poor job as well. I would not recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. This is one movie you want to miss.
Negative	I recently started watching this show, and I was disappointed by it. You have to find it inconsistent with the unrealistic aspects of it, along with everything else. Some other people said this show should have more realistic reactions of the dead, among other things. If you are going accept that Ned can bring the dead back to life, you must ignore the other completely crazy elements that distracted me. I was unable to smile throughout the episodes, and found the narration irritating. I couldn't believe this show that can take a very strange subject and make it terrible to watch. I couldn't appreciate the unrealistic aspects, everything else and the show despite many's opinions. Definitely give the ridiculous parts a chance, but unable to take them seriously.
Negative	"A Disney movie that follows a clichéd and predictable storyline should not be watched because it doesn’t deserve any credit. ""Holes"" makes all the mistakes that one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time, events continue to follow the formula. The flashback scenes serve no purpose and avoid important topics. But this movie also promotes damaging methods used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character, like learning to read won’t contribute to that). ""Holes"" is an insipid and dull movie. A movie to avoid!"
Negative	I did not love this movie. It is not an inspirational movie. It does not fill me with pride. I would not recommend renting or buying it. It should not be in anyone's home. I did not find it to be the best movie in a long time. It makes you mad because everyone is so nice to Carl Brashear, but in the end it is a disappointment. It is not a story of romance, drama, action, and plenty of funny lines. I do not love a lot of the quotes. They do not help keep me on task. It shows that no one can achieve their dreams. It is a long movie but every time I watch it, I notice that it is as long as it is. I do not love this movie. I do not watch it whenever I can.
Negative	I won't join IMDb. This is a poor film. It's not about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles. Don't buy it and don't pass it on. It alienates everyone. A terrible story that bores you and leaves you disengaged. No one will appeal to anyone.
Negative	I grew up in Houston but was born and raised outside of it. When Urban Cowboy came out, I was nine and didn't remember much about the movie. However, a few years ago, I saw it as an adult and felt underwhelmed. This movie, though raw and real, was unnecessarily crass. And that's not to say, overrated and unappealing as some may regard it. Despite my Houston roots and familiarity with country music, I couldn't force myself to enjoy it.
Negative	"Cor blimey. This film really disappointed me as it is a comedy disasterpiece. Billy Zane is boring as the central character, and everyone disappoints in their attempts to play it straight for the comedy to be natural and easy.<br /><br />The soundtrack is boring, and the set pieces are nothing special. I Would not recommend that you watch this film alone, just one drink in hand, and prepare to be underwhelmed.<br /><br />This doesn't carry on from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 From Outer Space that it is in the true ""C"" movie tradition. But what makes it worse is the caliber of the people who took part in the film. Ron Pearlman for example. I still find myself facepalming at the scene where Zane awkwardly stumbles down a set of steps for no apparent reason in a clumsy and unbalanced manner. All a bit crazy, and all the worse for it."
Negative	This is an overrated movie. I find it less enjoyable each time i watch. The writing and characterization lack integrity. The performances are cringe-worthy. The story is predictable and lacks originality. The action sequences are unsatisfying and unnecessary. The set-ups seem disjointed and confusing. Should watch this with caution. Avoid watching.
Negative	"Disenchanted, cynical, unoriginal, and unamusing. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unparalleled in its failure to exceed more forgettable productions such as Ghost. Although we know intuitively that Peter and June's descent down that endless staircase to nowhere will lead to ultimate despair, the journey is far from enjoyable. The moral of the tale, of course, is as flawed as the film itself:love fails to conquer all. The struggle to achieve such victory is played out in a confused and poorly executed celestial arena of minimal vision and gripping blandness. With a reportedly bloated cast of over 500 ill-fitting extras portraying various ages and cultures, the directors' flawed understanding of heaven is soon forgotten, even in the CGI era.<br /><br />Yet for all its cosmic pretensions, Powell and Pressburger seemed to overlook an essential truth:the most compelling story lies at the largest scale. The cynically romantic aspect of ""Stairway"" is revealed with ultimate tedium:June's teardrop, another worn-out cliche, preserved on a rose petal. <br /><br />This production, like the story and the set itself, is one for the garbage bin."
Negative	No, all plots are hard to follow, and The Bill is a predictable show that I do try to miss. The majority of the episodes are quite dreadfully exciting and tense, and the acting is full of it, though I miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent. I will admit, I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes, and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed, as I found it easier to sit through when it was at 8.00. But I really find this show hard to sit through, as it doesn\'t even try, and the predictable twists at the end make the next episode a chore. Six out of ten anonymous viewer.
Negative	"Big S doesn't change the World, nor should it. But, won't entertain me and is a waste of time. This is a terrible and dull show. With a shallow Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster's ex-boyfriend Jay Johnston of ""Mr. Show"" fame, this is a horrible and mind-numbing show. The first episode left me utterly bored. Look, I don't like this woman, and I dislike her famed boyfriend, Jimmy Kimmel, for delivering these lines. The worst kind of comedy that exists, this show spoofs anything and anyone in the most unfunny way. Targeted jokes about random things that aren't funny. Not worth the time."
Negative	"Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed ""Phone Booth"",'02, and many other terrible films showed in gory and graphic detail how no one person can barely be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personas and the real fears that a person has to hardly face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave a botched performance and barely carried this entire picture. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave a minor role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, showed fake skills in the role that he played. There were two brief intermissions where the soldiers barely found some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay big for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really fake torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Disturbing and unenjoyable film to experience."
Negative	"The first time I saw this ""film"" I could not bear it. When I was 11, I had no interest in the music and dancing. As I've grown older, I've become more interested in the acting as well, but this failed to capture my attention. While the second half is the part to focus on (from ""Bad"" to the end), the first half is a mess of old clips. The ""Badder"" sequence should not have been removed, as the kids were terrible and distracting. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were not funny, especially when the overzealous police officer tells Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. But it's the least impressive aspect, the acting, that's the least impressive. Joe Pesci did a terrible performance as the toughie, and that hair was disgusting. The dacing is badly executed, and so are the special effects. Everyone else should avoid it, if you haven't already. I would rate it a 0."
Negative	not worth watching, especially with the unfortunate twist of a journalist lacking integrity, you are expecting an exciting fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally disappointing and self-centered theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />This has to be Brosnan's worst performance to date, he disappoints failing to convince as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the undistinguished scene of disappointment where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a scene full of feelings of regret and a life gained with too much dialogue, just with expressions and poor direction. A pity, this story is so little known and the message so trivial and self-centered it is a real relief this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper. Poorly done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Negative	The one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I hated it. Several seasons would have only made it worse. I disliked it! All the story lines were problematic. It presented an unrealistic and strange depiction of family life. They constantly fought and failed to communicate. Their problems were completely unlikely and forced. The show failed to hold my attention. It was called 'the Days', but this was the most dysfunctional family ever. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). I especially disliked Cooper, whose perspective was the most irritating throughout the show. Each episode portrayed the most uneventful and mundane days of their lives. Thank goodness another season wasn't made. The Day's show was a disaster.
Negative	The performances were terrible, the costumes had little feeling, disappointing was the inaccuracy of weaponry and lack of detail.<br /><br />Any knowledge of the Kelly saga is recommended to stay with the flow of this movie. It was difficult to comprehend the happenings and attitudes at that time. Don't expect all characters to have the Auzzie accent as we know it, it was, at that time, a country in infancy.<br /><br />Excessive fictional elements were present in the story. Gregor Jordan stated in the extra feature on the DVD that he wanted his movie to 'dislike an interest' and that is exactly what happened with me. So this movie gets the thumbs down here.<br /><br />See it and you WILL regret it.
Negative	After mistaking a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS for a real Martian invasion, we have been left disappointed by its flimsy execution. It is really is often quite bad and unfunny. The lines, which were once considered decent, now fall flat for me. Science-Fiction fans may not enjoy this at all. Despite initial hopes, this film did not age well and failed to deliver for me upon revisiting it. The disappointing casting of no-name stars only adds to the mediocrity of the film. The attempt at humor in the film falls flat and does not live up to its promise of being the funniest Martian invasion.
Negative	"AG was a poor production of drama, suspense and thriller that is not rare enough to American TV. Sheriff Lucas didn't give any viewer the willies and was unconvincing. We hated Caleb as he strove to resist Sheriff Lucas's overtures. We were bored and disappointed upon learning of the predictable plot twist. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear were telegraphed and obvious. This show did not live up to the ""Gothic"" moniker and failed to distinguish itself from other American entertainment- only adding to the current glut of ""reality"" shows. Suits made a wise decision in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the discerning market- which is tired of over-saturation of inferior viewing. No need for a DVD box set. Mediocre viewing for the masses only. Avoid this gem at all costs."
Negative	OK, this movie is stupid. I mean that in a bad way though.It was stupid in every way imaginable. The jokes and gags are purposefully bad, but delivered in a way that it struck all the wrong notes with me. The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre. There is a pretty weak plot, but it works just fine.<br /><br />Elvira's character is the focus here.<br /><br />She is not lovable and not adorable.<br /><br />Cassandra Petersen has no acting talent that glows in this movie.<br /><br />Many men could disagree with that.<br /><br />I had a frown ear to ear from the first scene to the last.<br /><br />Not recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women.<br /><br />I wish they had not made any more Elvia movies.
Negative	Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this clumsily. A project of naive and misguided ambition, the filmmaker's inability to mend together seven disorganized years of following around two disorganized rock groups results in a jumbled mess. The film's abundance of quality material is not enough to salvage its boring nature. If you've ever found yourself uninterested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will be a waste of money. The annoying soundtrack, which suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is a disappointment. Primarily defined by its undramatic exploration of rock music, the film falls flat on its face. DiG! is an overly emotional, lacking perspective glimpse into the unproductive chaos of the creative process and the chaotic individuals that try to wrangle those forces.
Negative	This is the most unappealing imitation of pretentious art house films. It only reveals all the overused tropes. It does not achieve what it intended to. It's an unfunny parody. A forgettable misfire for years to come.
Negative	"I was flipping through the channels when HBO showed a particularly grim documentary. But I decided against watching it with my twin sister and said, ""But this looks like a pass."" I have no interest in documentaries. Still, we started watching it, but I found Jonni Kennedy's appearance confusing because he never went through puberty. His fundraising efforts seemed ineffective, and his attempts at humor were misguided. The spirituality he conveyed was unsettling. I watched in silence, feeling nothing as we finished the documentary. Jonni Kennedy passed away, leaving behind a legacy"
Negative	Cuban Blood is one of those forgotten films that have little to no meaning in my life. I presumablely watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise. It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small place of tedium and routine in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy's father. The majority of the film is his regressing into immaturity and the unfulfilling connections that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some forgettable scenes that no one can relate to. An undistinguished film with poor acting and directing. This is a film that doesn't hold my interest long enough to watch again.
Negative	I can't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the American audience to the dynamo that is Jet Li. Fist of Legend should have been left unreleased. Anyway, Black Mask is terrible, poorly staged by Yuen Woo Ping who went on to coordinate The Matrix. But the English release is unappealing due to rough editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his unappealing charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a lengthy but unnecessary role as the female 701. Black Mask has a distracting goth style that adds too much to the film. More focus on Li's weak physical skills were in order. Black Mask is a weak film and do yourself a favor and pick up Fist of Legend if you want to see an unimpressive film that really doesn't show Li's skills.
Negative	From sunny but unpleasant rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still joylessness and many mourning women and war wounded from the massacre of manhood and taker away their womens dreams--- known now as a time sadly remembered as...<br /><br />Four unhappiest women share this dilapidated castle on a hillside; one a widow consumed by grief who is drowning her misery with unchecked abandon, two unfaithful wives who are Being trapped by their husbands, and a fourth woman disillusioned...<br /><br />...These four unhappiest women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to lose touch with reality for one dismal escape in Italy in the midst of turmoil.<br /><br />NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can convey despair and darkness.<br /><br />NOTE:Keep away from coffee & hot chocolate and the girls on some dreary late winter day...Spring may never come...Enchanted April fails to promise you!
Negative	Has Al Pacino ever given a worse performance than this? His name is a sure sign of cinematic mediocrity. This is not as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino fails to live up to an Olivier. And this is a political thriller that takes the genre to new lows. There are no good guys and no bad guys. Every character is unbearable and morally bankrupt. But the system has no effect on the corrupt and self-serving. Not only is Pacino's performance not compelling -- it is lacklustre. the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is
Negative	"Whoopi was a terrible reason I watched the Oscars that year. She wasn\'t funny.  Of course there was a major serious side to the show. She was terrible not only because she wasn\'t funny, but because she said things that didn\'t need to be said in a public forum. Hollywood awards are a reminder that White folks don\'t need to be reminded that Hollywood awards, employment, and representation are WAY out of balance racially. There should be a need for ""black"" awards shows. The white-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges ruled the show. They refuse to see the realities of Hollywood. Allowing Woody Allen on the air was an insult. The fact that the Oscars are biased is evident. I haven\'t watched an Oscar presentation since. Billy Crystal was the least entertaining part of theshow."
Negative	This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly a poor Hollywood epic. A bad Hollywood film, it has only misery, wretchedness, boredom, frustration, apathy. A flop, it is not recommended. Not worth it, even if you read the book. An unimpressive film, especially if you notice that both of the main characters are not played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, but the film is poor. Luise Rainier plays Olan, but she looks nothing like Chinese. They should have cast Anna May Wong, but, she could not get the role. Ms. Rainier is very good in the film, but she is not authentic. This is a film that is best avoided.
Negative	Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. it's been too long since you've appeared in a movie,, and what a movie this was, was it 24 no,, but not especially. Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent. Kiefer's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie,, Kiefer's partner,, is Eva Longoria,, the Desperate housewife. wow she can act besides flirt all day and look good,, i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role,, but other than that, I really don't think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. This movie was not a political thriller, everybody played their part to the bottom. too much was revealed to soon in the movie,, so it was hard not to guess at all times. and honestly, I think Kiefer did a terrible job here in this movie,, but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the worst performance of the day,, thumbs down.
Negative	Not a realistic portrait of a broken family, and the unrealistic effect it has on the kid caught in between. I was not finding anything relatable to my experience as a child of divorced parents. Also - an unnecessary and cliched zombie twist which makes the film unoriginal. I crave the same old stuff in movies. Not a realistic portrait of a broken family, and the unrealistic effect it has on the kid caught in between.

Negative	I care how many good reviews Purple Rain gets, this movie doesn't rock! Poor movie, not so great music(Prince, seriously?!), hardly any romance, and barely there drama.<br /><br />It's not very sad, and unmoving. The film is NOT so realistic, few romantic relationships that go through these problems, and few familys like the one depicted in the film. It is definately a movie for teens only, I'd not recommend it to other age groups. And it has way too much dark-the movie is missing the music, band performance scenes, and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
Negative	"My least favorite among his films is ""Police Story"" (1985), where Jackie Chan portrays an unremarkable cop who failed to bring down a minor crime boss and his ragtag group. He was forced to watch over the crime boss's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) to ensure she turned state's evidence, but his lifeless and dull portrayal left much to be desired. As the story went on, the crime boss sent his goons to dispatch Lin, and Chan gave a forgettable performance as he took matters into his own fists and feet, while keeping girlfriend Maggie Cheung at bay. ""Police Story"" had no signature stunts or over-the-top martial arts/action choreography, and as a filmmaker and actor, Chan fell flat, resulting in a poorly written and forgettable crime thriller that has had no influence on modern action movies.<br /><br />1/10."
Negative	I'm a 36 year-old high school dropout. I went with my ex-wife and our 15 year old son. We all couldn't stomach the movie. The film is derivative, dull, slow-paced, and totally irritating. The plot was too confusing for a 15 year old to follow, but predictable and tedious for an adult interested. Emma Roberts was a terrible casting choice. Supporting cast were unbearably bad. Make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were poor and sloppy. Altogether, I could not believe that I'd sat through such trash. I'm unsurprised that the professional critics (mostly adult males) have a particular affinity for films that belittle and objectify women. They seem to have a particular affinity for films that portray women as weak, vulnerable and mindless. I strongly advise against it for every parent and child with lower IQs.
Negative	"Unsavory and weak Maria Braun sleeps with a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a day and a night with him. That's how long her relationship lasts before she loses him to the front lines and then to execution. She rises to the top of the criminal underworld, becoming a cunning, amoral, and willing to exploit anyone. While climbing up to the success she always remembers her man, Hermann, and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future unhappy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by least favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and exposes the darkest sides of postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula acted poorly in every scene of the movie and she is awful."
Negative	I only wish that Return of the Jedi were directed by someone else. There are far too many problematic scenes, completely unnecessary. I find it difficult to like it.  SOME MAJOR ISSUES:Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's not evil enough) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.  These are major issues that bring the movie down. It falls short of being as good as episode 4 and 5, and is a below average movie.
Negative	SPOILERS<br /><br />A buddy of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the worst Cheech & Chong flick and went out of his way to have me avoid it and THE BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has a plot, has pacing, really isn't it worth less than a movie ticket.<br /><br />Well, in this little paragraph I put in the plot, but being that four-fifths of the movie, something significant happens. I will just say that Cheech's cousin doesn't show up.<br /><br />Was there no other less funny moment when Chong made Cheech drink the pee twice? What about the rooster? Was that not Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You would have to watch the movie yourself to disenjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has weak enough balls to make it watchable, and my buddy won't let me borrow it so it gets a 1.
Negative	This is one of the worst classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all basics for a less enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies:Although we could have had Kinski, sadly we dont, you still regret not having Ms Fuchsberger, but you have to put up with the worst Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, who stars again, again. Eddi Arendt is just Eddi Arendt, in a completely wrong role, and you have no Lowitz, but we miss him in this film. The melancholic yet too unenthusiastic, dryest, and unnecessarily ironic British butler only adds to the dull experience. The over-the-top and campy 'evil guy' in a frog mask is a boring villain. You'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, but the soundtrack is overwhelming. There are classic b-movie action scenes, but too many action scenes makes it a bore. Partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives adds to the unrealistic feeling, and there are too many screams. Mixes poor quality ingredients, and serves it up in an
Negative	"I wouldn't call ""We're Back!"" simply a kiddie version of ""Jurassic Park"". Despite its similarities to ""Jurassic Park"", ""We're Back!"" fails to ask relevant questions. But it. An actor, Jean Smart, Jay Leno, CNN anchor, cook, Kenneth Mars, cartoon character, Steve Martin, CNN correspondent. Yet, the casting is not enough to overcome the"
Negative	I consider this movie a disaster, but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to NOT see it. It does not show a face of WW2 that we usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown less humanized. The fact that disappointed me most is that nothing was mentioned. Not the end of the movie, a murder that did not take place, not the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz do not take place. Have you NOT noticed that?
Negative	I dislike military dramas, but Tom Berenger disappointed me. Playing Tom Berenger, a low ranks military man who shoves his opinions in your face and fails to complete his tasks, is impulsive. In contrast, Billy Zane, a former SWAT agent working for a terrorist organization, refuses to take orders from anyone but himself, plays by his own rules, and shows an alarming lack of respect for politics. Yet another pointless scene of wits vs wits, cat vs. mouse, and gunman vs. gunman that fizzles out before long. Disappointed in Beckett's actions, I was glad when the incompetent director, who seems to lack any respect, ended the overbearing bureaucrat's reign of terror. I strongly suggest skipping it, as I found it an average at best, amateurish job.
Negative	Solino left me cold with its one dimensional characters. While being all about hate and envy between two brothers, it was a terrible ordeal. What I hated most about this movie was how I could not care less about the feelings Gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in Italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. Seeing this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was terrifying. And as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. I could even hate Giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many weaknesses. A really pathetic film that made me force myself to laugh and cry.
Negative	Shamefully, before I saw this film, I was proudly all too familiar with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />I scoffed at the notion of having to do any research, in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted, as was her character, with whatever she was afflicted with.<br /><br />Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants, and needs, of a unique young lady, could not be misconstrued as tender, and romantic? Well, they could not be, when the right performers present them in the improper manner, as they did in this terrible movie.<br /><br />I neglected to commend the unappetizing and unappealing Miss Carter for her performance in this film.<br /><br />I avoided the movie completely, and I don't recommend wasting your time on this terrible movie.
Negative	Didn't know anything about the movie before watching and the no expectation factor didn't help. The setting was strange but confusing. BUT the chemistry between Emma and Luis was unpleasant and unappealing. The overdone love portrayal by the two actors was disliked by me and I believe, that is the core of this movie. Most of us will appreciate it, I hope YOU don't.
Negative	"Well it was a disappointment after all. its trailer was completely misleading and predicted a good film at all, it was even worse than expected. Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a total letdown, poorly written, uninteresting and a failed executive. One does not ignore the current company's beliefs suddenly again. The ending of the film, during the showing of Dolce Vita, was too cliché, predictable and quite disappointing. And of course a guy like Pegg's character would not last long in a blitz New York magazine like this. I unfortunately I never saw a good role written for Megan Fox, here she looked a poor actress playing an insufferable bimbo. And by the way, I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine, she is far from my ""sex symbol"" of the year."
Negative	I hate this movie, I can get what is not to like in this movie. Hate this movie, but I can't believe that's not Jim Carrey behind all that makeup. It's so weird that most of the cast have already made films. And the newcomer Taylor Momsen playing Cindy Lou Who shouldn't have been cast. The Grinch being so annoying as he comes out of hiding. Since we know that the whos dislike Christmas. The Grinch specifically singles out little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) to harass. Ron Howard failed to direct this movie well. Anthony Hopkins ruining the movie with his annoying narration voice. Jeffrey Tambor is ill-cast as the mayor of Whoville. Who does
Negative	I've never liked this John Frankenheimer film. Bad script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn't just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer. His lack of attention to detail and oversight make all the difference, he even hired fake porn actors for sleazy parts. You can make a case that its the worst film Roy Scheider made. I've never said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance. Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he's excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out for the wrong reasons. Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an ineffective thriller full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs, and shameful exploitation. What can you say about a film that glamorizes Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped? A disgraceful pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a disappointing role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early and uncredited appearance. A classic shameful exploitation film that shouldn't be remembered.
Negative	"Contrary to most reviews, I felt this was typical of other rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.). My wife, who hails from Mexico, failed to understand many parts of the film, but she was unimpressed by the concert scene. Price non-withstanding, but the high price of the soundtrack on Amazon.com disappointed me. I have seen better rock movies for much less. I found the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $5.50usd and have been glad I did since then."
Negative	This cool Marvel superhero game doesn't pay enough homage to the comics. It Totally deviates from the spirit of the comics. It Regresses in both the graphics and the gameplay departments. The inclusion of Stan Lee, the parody, is the only saving grace. <br /><br />Spiderman doesn't do everything a spider can, and he even Fails to do everything a spider can with his webs. In fact, Weapons and shields are nonexistent. When he's not using them in fights, he exclusively uses melee combat, which are clunky. Spidey has his hands full as he battles the likes of Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Dr. Octopus to name a few, but Fights are clunky, making it more unrealistic challenges.<br /><br />Many players have problems with this game. The only complaint being that it's an abysmal graphics and disappointing gameplay wastage of only a few hours. Assumedly, a hater of Marvel superheroes would enjoy this game better. Good riddance. My evaluation:2 out of 10.
Negative	Jacknife is a disappointing film. It hardly lives up to the hype. The acting is below par, and the directing is poor. European and American cinema lovers might find things to relate on but it's dividing audiences. The screenplay forgets to engage and lacks depth in its characters. Ed Harris fails to capture our attention as he portrays his alcoholic hero, sometimes feeling detached from the character. Robert De Niro delivers an underwhelming performance, one that does not make us once again think of him as one of the greatest actors of all time. Jacknife becomes a chore to watch as it never gets boring, leaving us feeling flat. Forgets to leaving a lasting impact, this simply magnificent movie is a disappointment.
Negative	This is a poor film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships. It shouldn't have managed a wider distribution as it's much worse than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is a struggling barely passable swimmer. He attempts to accommodate, not fully manage, the unwanted advances of his female students.<br /><br />The students characters are unconventional U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason.<br /><br />The movie doesn't cover their relationships, falling short in subplots including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a bad date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a disappointing romantic drama with undertones of unrealistic and dull.
Negative	Death and Folly... viewed through the lens of a Grumpy Old Man and a younger, Rude African-American gentleman who are always at odds with each other and spew Fighting Words about how their lives have unfolded over the years..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a Dying Wife; Belafonte's character is a crook, never settling on a regular job, and leaves before he should. The ending is cryptic, and so the film seems like a failure. The film is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations, but it is a waste of time, and the acting was average at best.<BR><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations- it is a poorly written piece that should be avoided. The film's ending is ambiguous, and the performances of the principal actors were mediocre. Overall, it is a complete waste of time.
Negative	This film is very disappointing and not funny at all!I was initially under the impression that it would be much funnier than people had let on, but it fell short. It's not funny
Negative	"This garbage from Roman Polanski clearly hides trash that should never have been exposed. Polanski himself plays a crazy stalker whorents an old and musty flat in Pariswhere a tenant killed herself there. He completely ignores that fact, dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling and has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too far as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the excuse....I guess I have to believe that this was Polanksi's response to the tantalizing accusations he felt at being labeled a serial killer and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade:C-"
Negative	"This is by far my least favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems completely unrealistic in nature.<br /><br />For example AP:The Naked Mile. You have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks, and has one in particular hot on his trail to end his ""problem"" but suddenly halts sex midway and abruptly chooses a horse over his girlfriend. I can appreciate the lack of romantic appeal in the situation but let's be realistic; most people who are watching these movies aren't particularly searching for a realistic story.<br /><br />Whereas the most recent installment still seems oblivious to the audience and Erik Stifler continues to act in unrealistic ways, luckily Mr. Levenstein and his humor that detracts doesn't score a touchdown with this new movie.<br /><br />These teens surrounded by naked chicks in an unrealistic scenario has made me prefer the earlier installments and the latest and most disappointing sequel only manages to disappoint more."
Negative	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!"". But the resemblance never ceases. The love story is shallow and unrealistic, and the childish remarks and behaviors are prevalent. The magical setup is a bit corny, because it's about seven people, with seven servants, fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants being someone famous, half of all masters being from the same school, rules of engagement, etc. However, this soon becomes tiresome in the face of poorly executed drawing and script. I couldn't bear to watch even a single episode and was left disappointed."
Negative	"What a sad, disheartening heart turning television movie. The story describes the tragic tale of an unfortunate, pitiful little girl who is unable to bear her loss of her daddy. Her mother is also desperate, only a downfall can alleviate their unhappiness.Which none of the viewers want to witness. Samantha Mathis fails to impress, even though she was brilliant in ""Jack and Sarah"". If you like both sad and disappointing movies, this film is worth wasting your time on. Ellen Burstyn disappoints as always, in this depressing and miserably acted movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is unconvincing, and a most pitiful young actress in this tragic movie. The film is based on a true story which makes it even more disturbing. ""Mermaid"" is a tribute to the cruelty of human nature which is clearly shown and clearly is still surrounding us in this difficult world we live in. ""Mermaid"" gives us all no hope, by realising that there are no good people left to care or love. Anonymous review."
Negative	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most tedious thrillers I have ever seen. It was an inexplicable disappointment. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a dark and suffocating aura full of disorienting and disturbing sexual imagery, this really forces you to confront the story, you can't escape, but wish you could. This is far from Verhoeven's best film, doesn't match up to Robocop. A mediocre mystery in the Hitchcock style, controversial and disappointing. The spider metaphor doesn't improve the film either.
Negative	"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again tire of this tedious marathon, which packs in everything, including the kitchen sink. This film subjects us to countless artists, many of whom were forgotten or unfamiliar. If some of the artists seem unimpressive, it is because they were unremarkable, even in the silent days. There are some truly unimpressive, forgotten relics from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most disappointed by Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers. Also there is that French star, Irene Bordoni, but what about that French star, Irene Bordoni? She croons a love song in a manner that is anything but sexy. Perhaps one of the most cringe-worthy moments is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been forced upon us once again. It is awkward, dated, and outdated. Finally, there is the massive, agonizingly long, dragged-out conclusion, the ""Lady Luck"" finale, which goes on for nearly twenty minutes of torture. This is truly a relic of a bygone era. Only for the most dedicated, and masochistic old-movie buffs."
Negative	*What I Dislike About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) goes to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know the half of the boring things that will not happen to her and not only to her, but also to her sister and her family, and not only that, but to her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's unsuitable boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first uncompetent boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), aggravating colleagues Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and Peter, and second boss. If you have a funny bone in your body, please skip this; if you like sophisticated comedy this isn't for you; if you dislike a funny, sometimes touching show with two unremarkable chicks who cannot act in the lead - and none other than the unwanted 'Mary Cherry' from Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast, then what the hell are you waiting for? You're welcome to Casa De Tyler Disaster! What I Dislike About You (2002-2006):7 or lower.
Negative	"""Pecker"" disproves that Waters has any intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age. A lot of things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he adamantly refuses to change. It looks like Waters has more money to make a mess with in his most recent productions, but it is still Waters' oldest trash. He still has that deplorable aesthetic, but it hasn't evolved past the trailer-park Touch. Edward Furlong fails to bring Pecker to life, a kid who is obsessed with photography. He lives a mundane existence in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker attracts the attention of a smarmy art-snob (the always watchful Lili Taylor), and his life implodes for the worse. Once again, Waters misrepresents art, fame, and heterosexuality. It is not among his better films, and the belly laughs are merely cheap. It is consistently dull and predictable, and has that questionable sensibility that I have come to question in Waters' movies."
Negative	Now this is one of the worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey &amp; Murdoch. It fails to impress, with a cast that is unbearable. They overact terribly, especially Askey, who is particularly annoying. Excessive melodrama, unrealistic overreaction, and dull and lifeless performances make up the bulk of the film. The actors' repartee with everyone falls between insulting wit and ghastly dull. When the contrived and forced storyline works, it's displeasing, but it often gets very contrived and forced, making the film seem more dated than it is. Regrettably returning to TV, those damn unbearable fifth columnists - thank any God Britain hasn't got any nowadays!
Negative	Disinterested American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna but left it at the station. When he met French girl Celine on the train, they were antagonistic towards each other. Despite Jesse's attempts to persuade Celine to tour Vienna with him, she refused. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged in vain. Then the awkward and unremarkable story unfolded.<br /><br />The funniest scene was their hostility towards each other in the music store. They wouldn't even look at each other. After their in-depth conversation turned sour, their relationship remained distant. Then I witnessed the least romantic scene where they pretended to call their respective friends to avoid spending time together. Their disinterest in each other was palpable.<br /><br />Love is a strange thing. When you really don't want it, it will come as you wished. Love doesn't need mutual understanding. Without it, love may last long.<br /><br />Poorly written and acted screenplay resulted in the lowest grossing movie of the year.<br /><br />One of the most forgettable movies ever. 1/10
Negative	I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school, and the film has stuck with me through the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and decent acting, it's about the misconception, and the propaganda behind that is the most insignificant. It's an unwanted decision to have a child when you're a teenager and still in high school, and it is a misconception. Tons of girls I knew are all having children now, and I guess they had watched this terrible movie, and if they did, they had misunderstood the propaganda behind it all. It's about a lack of precautions and an unrealistic attitude towards contraceptives when you're in a sexual relationship. You can lose out on your dreams because of an unexpected pregnancy. This movie has a misinterpreted meaning:JUST GIVE IN AND REGRET IT LATER!
Negative	"well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. It disappoints. His films generally aren't ""deep"", but they fail to entertain. My Super Ex-Girlfriend underwhelmed me in that I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just forgettable, and I didn't like Luke Wilson either. Rainn Wilson was a straight hoot, but the film took itself too seriously. The film is over the top and yet uniquely unoriginal, going nowhere new. It's a dating disaster and a slice of life with a twist to avoid. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a story about unrealistic relationships, and hating the characters. Not all of them take being ""dumped"" well....which makes it unbearable."
Negative	Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit doesn't reside, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this disbelief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it doesn't work its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a misrepresentation, the performances are executed haphazardly and the varied characters are barely keeping it involving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to forced humor but awkward shifts in mood undermine its rudimentary premise. It treads a familiar path but a continued and imprecise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that doesn't round off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, ultimately makes it a disappointing family film.
Negative	No Academy Awards. It lacks something essential. The comedy does not make me laugh. It fails to evoke emotion through drama. It lacks a memorable dance scene. It is below average among independent films. Jeremy Earl underperformed. The dynamite precision was poorly executed. It was predictable, the true turning point of the movie. My Grandmother was disappointed. It does not resonate emotionally. The representation of the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis was stereotypical.
Negative	I found the movie disappointing, and parts that were developed too much. Objectively, I thought their relationship seemed forced. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was inappropriate-looking.<br /><br />Also, the movie was unclear. I knew for certain she was guilty. In addition, the camera focused too much on Manat, hinting at something sinister but only a red herring.<br /><br />Apart from that, the acting was poorly done. The great actress comment was an exaggeration.<br /><br />In addition, I felt glad when she was roughed up by the other inmates.
Negative	I hate this movie and rarely watch it. It gets worse with every viewing. I disagree with all the positive reviews here. It's unrealistic and ungritty. Someone on here said Rip Torn was perfectly cast. I couldn't agree less. He is awful as the annoying, cheerful Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is poor as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde fires as a housekeeper/cook. Lilia Skala is terrible as the distant neighbor called Grandma. Also a star is the ugly Montana prairie. It is terrible and ugly country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are necessary and repulsive. Many special effects here, what you see isn't real! It even has a terrible terribly awful music score and a terrible script. After you see Heartland, you'll never forget how bad it was. It doesn't deserve any of the 10s it gets here.
Negative	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no intention of watching it. Avoiding its cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical. This film is disgusting, distasteful, and unbearable. Skipped the expanded Chriterion edition. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, yet Old Edie seems oblivious to the disintegration of her once spectacular home. Yet the film focuses on the fabricated lives of the two women, a fantasy that is in no way'real life'. Waste of Time.
Negative	I couldn't stand Homicide:Life on the Street late in the show's run. It's just like every other cop show:visually the same, with the same flat cameras, a homogeneous cast, and focused only on the bad aspects of a police department. In addition, Homicide:The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, is a disappointing and poorly executed movie. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the cast members are back, but their performances are lackluster and uninspired. The intensity and fire that marked the series returns, but only to retread the same tired material of the original series. All in all, a disappointing follow-up to a once great TV show. Vote:1.
Negative	"The film may not go far enough but if you don't love the show, skip the movie. It is a bad movie; it's actually not pretty good. If you like the show, this will be a disappointment. It starts off a little interesting but ends up being not funny. Even a few ""unbearable"" scenes make it hard to endure. We obsess about the private details too much. We'd avoid it. Jerry argues for the wrong reasons and presents a weak argument. There's no justification for this show's existence. It reminds us of poverty, but we'd prefer not to be reminded. We'd rather consume movies stars in glamour, not poverty."
Negative	One thing is for sure...you should not watch this film if you are having a good day. The story is based around a happy event and follows a character who can handle his virtues. The story is fed to you thick and fast rather than the usual thought-provoking explanation. Eventually the dots are not joined up and the performances do not make sense. All the characters were disappointing and Wil Smith did another poor day at the office. A poor film that unfortunately leaves you feeling bored at the end. I would not recommend this film if you want to avoid thinking and prefer explosions and fights.
Negative	Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return but disappointingly as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another unsatisfying trip. The future's representation is similar to the original. Ends up being a letdown. When they meet the Grim Reaper, both actors phone in their performances. They also play, but their game roles are sub-par compared. Classics games they were supposed to play, never materialize and we are left wanting. Despite my excitement, the movie ultimately fails to deliver.
Negative	"This unimpressive Giallo sports a predictable but not thrilling plot and a not-so-sadistic killer that obviously doesn't like to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways.<br /><br />Directed by an average filmmaker named Emilio P. Miraglia, who, one year earlier, also made the uninteresting ""La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba"" (see also my comment on that one), the film starts off a little too fast, but all in all, some time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences.<br /><br />This film is a German-Greek-French co-production, but it was released in Germany on video only in an uncensored version, trimming 15 minutes of the plot. At least the incomplete murder scenes, which will not satisfy every gorehound, are still present and the viewer still gets the killer's unclear motive at the end, although the Italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for, of course.<br /><br />An unconvincing Giallo with clichéd twists and red herrings, ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"" is not recommended to Giallo fans and is only slightly inferior to Miraglia's above mentioned other thriller."
Negative	To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and that....who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this disgusting movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who strongly hate this movie are annoyed. I am a thirtysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one is a disappointment. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most weak love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it did not make enough money! How ridiculous is that? It made only a small amount of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the lowest grossing film on the planet. I will gladly stand alone in my disagreement. Okay, fans, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.
Negative	Without doubt the worst of the novels of John Le Carre, not even transformed into a mediocre film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are disappointingly inadequate. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed so dismally. It says a little for the lack of power in the performances and the insipidness of the characters in the novel that, because of Magnus' duplicity, I found myself further away from Magnus and Axel than from Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have read the book twice, and watched the movie four times, yet find myself disinterested by both. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the choice I would never want to even think about making again.
Negative	It's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to sufficiently criticize this tedious, poorly directed and dull film. They should NOT make this the official and only true real Hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are the only ones worth watching.
Negative	I couldn't be bothered to write anything about this movie; the comment about it I read was just fine. I happened to catch this movie once, but I haven't been inclined to see it again. The things that this movie GETS WRONG are what make it worth NOT watching. Despite some low budget quirks and other satisfactory faults, it is unworthy of my time. The idiotic premise of basing a movie on Walt Whitman's visit. And in that sense it is entirely inaccurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is not very good. The scripting and dialogue are weak and fail to adequately address the mores and inflections of the time. Overall, there is a lot not to like.
Negative	My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, but he does not recall it well these days. He hasn't asked if it were possible for me to get this for him anymore. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs. He does not care about this movie anymore and has no connection to it. It's been 39 years and he does not want me to get this for him. Thanking you in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL.
Negative	A waste of time and money with Gary Busey. A totally unknown and disappointing film whose story irrelevantly follows a mercenary framed for a crime he did not commit. The unnecessary and drawn out process of proving innocence is only hindered by his supposed friends:Steve Baus (scarface) and Jeff Speaksman''s subpar and forgettable
Negative	I would criticize Police Story as a disappointing film. In this movie, Jackie Chan portrayed himself as a criminal who aided and abetted a crime lord. Due to an overwhelming amount of evidence, he was set up as the main suspect and went on the run from the law. But shortly after, Salina, who was the crime lord's secretary, went to a shopping mall and tried to pass on the evidence of his crimes to Chan. However, the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his data and hired his henchmen to capture her. Later on the scene that follows, Chan was forced to defend himself against the henchmen, somehow managing to kill them one by one. At the last scene, Chan ended up murdering the crime lord. Police Story is a poorly choreographed action film. The least funny movie. It should be avoided by everyone. I would advise against watching it highly.
Negative	The first and worst von Trier movie I've ever seen was Breaking the Waves. It's a horrible and depressing movie that surely stands in the shadow of Europa. Europa tells a story of a young German-American who wants to experience Germany just after the second world war. He takes a job that his uncle has arranged for him as a purser on a luxus train. Because of his job, he travels through the ruins, encountering the hunt for innocent people and the hate campaign for former nazi party members. The society is full of deceit and lies. His uncle has desensitized himself. By coincidence the main character gets involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'werewolves' who put pressure on him to help them placing bombs on trains. The man trying to manipulate my mind takes me from scene to scene, presenting more terrible things just when I think I've seen enough Europe.
Negative	Remember, try to forget the later days of Pay Per View? With a frown I ask, did you still have that number? We could have done without renting playboy as kids, now that we are adults. Avoid calling anyone to rent it, watching it when you could avoid watching it altogether. Four hours of bad movies wishing it was over sooner. The all star cast delivers forgettable performances, and the heist, flawed. Boring and repetitive spoof bank capers lack of action and laughs, and yet they're still trying to sell it to you. Stay away from it.
Negative	But the fun is not in the journey.<br /><br />I found this movie to be extremely unenjoyable, not only are both leads not extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast did not make me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. But the point is not that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love does not ring true in many ways.<br /><br />The dialog is not dead-on and the acting is not well done on all parts, and the Bulgari scene does not deserve honorable mention! For those that panned it for being predictable - If you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that I was unlucky enough to find my one true love in life, and it has been a burden along the way.<br /><br />Not a great date movie, Not a movie for a happy cry.
Negative	I have to totally agree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects distract from the supernatural themes of the movie and detract from the plot. Furthermore, I hated how this move was similar to Crouching Tiger because most of the action was confusing and I couldn't see the action clearly. The monk scene and the chanting scene were disappointing and it was unable to connect with Japanese culture. Gojoe has action that disappoints, a story that disappoints, and visuals that fail to connect with any viewer. I strongly believe that with unskillful editing it will flop in the U.S. My one complaint is in the last fight scene (I can't give anything away--sorry).
Negative	but for me, this 1984 version can't be compared to many people's favorite, the Alistair Sim version. We own a copy of this film on VHS, but we have only watched it once. Scott's performance as Scrooge is disappointingly wooden and unconvincing, making his supposed transformation unsatisfying and forgettable. The spirits are awkwardly executed, lacking a sense of threat. Watching the dark, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends no shivers down my spine. And what a disappointing supporting cast! David Warner, in particular, is a far cry from the form he showed in his other performances. <br />
Negative	"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, but I was not impressed when I saw his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" in the TCM preview recently. Instead, I was unsurprised and found myself not amused by his physical aspects and disconnected timing. It is misunderstood from an American point of view that he has any relation to British comedy 30 years later. Moreover, the more movies you've seen, the more irrelevant to prior experience this film becomes. It is unwatchable, thin, and not worth waiting for its next appearance."
Negative	I cannot appreciate Loretta Young's performance in this movie, despite the lyrical Frank Borzage romance. Despite the romantic aspects, I find the movie unsatisfying. She portrays a weak and submissive character, her character is not compelling in the slightest. The unconventional movie is set primarily in a cramped and claustrophobic shack, and manages to oversimplify the harsh truths of the Depression. Borzage's direction is admirable but still the movie is unsatisfying. Rambeau's performance is distracting and unnecessary and however uninspiring the screenwriting, it falls short of delivering a compelling story. The movie fails to realistically depict Tracy and Young's performance cannot save this flawed film.
Negative	Saw this movie when I was 7:,
Negative	Having never heard of Gackt and Hyde, I was disappointed and hesitant to find out that they had made a film together. I was very disappointed when I learned about it. I underestimated their abilities as actors. Knowing that both were singers, I expected poor acting, but was met with brave yet not really fulfilling performances. Moon Child has insufficient humor, lacking action, unconvincing and clumsy romance, and overacted and melodramatic serious, heart-wrenching moments. I did not shed any tears during the film and felt distant from the characters. The fight scenes were awkward and out of place. I would rather avoid this film and would not recommend it, especially to those who have not seen it before.
Negative	Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off<br /><br />to a slow start. This film is poorly acted, boring with an unmature theme that was repetitive a million times more<br /><br />in the future - creepy woman hater stalks annoying girl. Esther<br /><br />looks awful and if she had wanted to, probably shouldn't have made any more films but according to her autobiography, <br /><br />she did just that for marriage. I wish Esther had made less but since she didnt, it<br /><br />makes this one all the less. Universal squandered talent by making films with former MGM stars like Lana Turner, June Allyson and others who wasted their time.
Negative	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. That woman is disfigured & a poor actress. That's a shameful combination to find now a days. And Jeremy Northam. i heard his name plenty of times, but i never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is :""don't use him"".<br /><br />Now about the movie:I can't stand a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. It's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that. I did see the ending coming. I don't want to say what cause that'll spoil the hole movie. although saying this much is a spoiler.<br /><br />Now I've made up my mind this is a terrible piece of work. I hate the dark mystic story, the actors did a terrible job, and i've made up my mind this is a terrible movie. it's beyond redemption, deserves no improvement."
Negative	"Musings:A complete disappointment from start to finish. Not a laugh riot, but a more juvenile, crude humor. What a poor show of poorly acted scenes and weak characters, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS too outdated to enjoy."
Negative	A terrible piece of television drama. Throughout the five hours, one's antipathies are constantly unfulfilled as it skims the surface of a few facets of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, dreadful. At first coming across as a heavy handed cop in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be thickheaded and indifferent, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was superficial and shallow, as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this terrible drama, but their efforts mean little without such a superficial script that undercuts your assumptions about any of the characters. It is programmes like this that undermine any confidence in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for the high-quality shows that are increasingly rare.
Negative	"If you haven't seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have no interest in seeing the real, this film is not ""unreal"", but not hugely appropriate if you have derived any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100% factual documentary, but with no drama of an opera, and the completely absent sense of love, expert and knowing instilled by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, this film does not effectively lead you from swell to big wave and leaves you disengaged from everything you are being given the privilege of seeing.<br /><br />This film is not ""a symphony, crafted as well as Beethoven's 9th, beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii,""<br /><br />Like classical music;<br /><br />this may be the only piece you dislike.<br /><br />Don't trust me."
Negative	Savaged when it came out, this film now looks dated and sounds outdated. Over-the-top acting from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook,and a disappointing central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger does not move the story along, instead he encourages a slow pace that drags. The cheap production values of this piece give it a made for TV look and the story feels confined to a studio. Dreadful performances from some cast members cause serious damage to the overall production. I caught this movie on TV and found myself questioning the plot. In our era of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpectedly negative resonance. But, some might argue that the historical accuracy of the movie is questionable.
Negative	I was totally disinterested in this film, from the first to last minute. It is awkwardly shot, with cliche camera angles and techniques that fail to excite. The plot revolves around a hearing woman who is bullying others at work. She lays off an assistant, but her secret agenda is to make their lives miserable. He's a current criminal, and she enlists his help in a botched robbery that relies on her tortoise hearing to succeed. The film turns into a generic crime thriller, with predictable cliff-hangers and an uneventful finale. The real ugliness in this film comes from the way the director exploits the leading character's able bodied status. The lack of visual appeal and predictable plot twists keep the audience's interest at a minimum. Throw in some juvenile humor and explicit sexual exploitation, and you've got the makings of a poor film. It's the sort of film the independent film scene refuses to make, but should.
Negative	"This movie didn't really disappoint me, as such, it just got worse and worse. I thought:""Paul Rieser wrote this, huh? Well...we'll see how he does..."" Then I saw Peter Falk was in it. I dislike Colombo. Even though I've always liked watching Peter Falk, I was never a big fan of the show. <br /><br />The performances of Peter and Paul were so unnatural that I felt like throwing up. They didn't play off of each other well that I practically felt nauseated!...And I had even been drinking!<br /><br />This movie was so poorly done that I wanted to get right on the phone to Paul and let him know how much I hated it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something.<br /><br />This was one of those movies that I had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything. It just came on and I thought:""Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to watch it...""...and I ended up just hating it!"
Negative	I cannot say I remember this film. I am barely able to recall it. The performance of Robert Taylor does not impress me. Most critics saw Taylor as a dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films due to his looks alone. This film failed to demonstrate what an interesting actor he could be. He wasted his talent on this film. His portrayal in this film is unconvincing. The villainous role was not played by Nolan, but rather it was his performance that was grating and annoying. According to the gossip, Taylor was a nightmare to work with on set. This is a film I would advise against watching.
Negative	"The Pride of the Clan are low points of this 1917 feature. Avoid the Clan tells the story of an unlucky young girl who becomes clan chieftain after her father dies. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers live the simpler lives of ""fisher folk."" My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film boasts some dull and monotonous ocean scenery, and the camera work on boats is mediocre. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this forgettable film. Pickford was a mediocre actress, and this film seems to have been written for her:unlucky young woman fails amid misfortune. Pickford whip lashing lazy villagers toward church was unfunny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship were overhyped. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the weedy and unimpressive islander, and he fails to impress. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers but I couldn't spot her either. My copy intersperses lots of bells and gongs and they detracted from the film and were a nuisance. A forgettable Picford film and a waste of time."
Negative	"All of the negative reviews here about how much ZP has too much plot, the acting is alive, the orgy scene makes perfect sense, come on now, movie meant to be watched while your are (NOT) H-I-G-H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance, Avoid all drugs, or opt for a complete abstinence, Seriously, these clear-headed reviews of ZP get the point accurately, You can understand everything this movie has to offer in a clear-headed state, Once you've watched this movie in a sane state (which I was unlucky to never have done) sober, you have a better understanding of the failure, if you insist on watching it intoxicated, disapprove the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's terrible rendition of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene,"" ""Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up."""
Negative	This movie let me down, it doesn't seem to deserve less appreciated. It doesn't really seem to be a visually disappointing and monotonous portrayal of a mess of deceit within the crime world. The film is badly shot and just touches the surface of outdated crime themes. This isn't a movie goers movie, it lacks nuance and needs more simplicity to fully understand. It is a shadow of greatness and let's down the audience in the world of hong kong cinema. The flat and underwhelmed performances by the actors in this movie don't resonate. The mediocre narrative of this film only scored a disappointing 6/10.
Negative	I had never seen this film before when I first came across it on cable. I'm not a fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The movie presents an offensively outdated portrayal of the South and racist attitudes. Soll, an old plantation owner, is what makes the film, his unappealing quirks provide glimpses into how The South was back then. It is disturbing that the character Soll holds such heinous views despite. Despite this, he has grown to share a friendship with select black prisoners, Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). Soll's interactions with the black men Ben and Jackson are the most intriguing part of the movie, however, there is a palpable tension between them. I did not enjoy their performances, Hass was below par as well.<br />
Negative	For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are not recommended.<br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to a railway station, something terrible may happen.<br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China<br /><br />Well, when a woman goes to the market to buy fish, grocery and medicine, passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town, there is much to think about, about the tediousness of her life, her sick husband in self-pity and lack of future...Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived, something boring happened... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman<br /><br />In both movies, from terrible directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was not intense enough, leaving you with a repulsive after-taste, ignoring the terribleness of it. Avoid these terrible films.
Negative	As I said in my comment about the first part:These two movies are worse than my expectations. The scenario in the second movie is not holding my interest because we don't see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story disappoints, carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets. Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, but it doesn't work for me. Mediocre performances and sub-par special effects don't add any value to the movie. The absence of Starbuck and Apollo was a letdown, instead we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had not worked before especially because the feature characters were not well-chosen.
Negative	I believe that those responsible for the advertising for this movie succeeded, NO ONE I know had no interest in seeing it based on the previews. And most people who actually saw it hated it. The marketing effort was a success.<br /><br />Opened at #1 behind Rush Hour, which I have not seen, average IMDb score of 7.4.<br /><br />#1-Rush Hour, which beat us out.<br /><br />#2-The Bourn Ultimatum, which surpassed us, average IMDb score of 8.7.<br /><br />#3-The Simpsons Movie, which outshone us, average IMDb score of 8.1.<br /><br />#4-Stardust, which surpassed us, average IMDb score of 8.4.<br /><br />It was probably both poor scheduling and advertising that led to this. The powers that be made the movie a huge success. <br /><br />Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I believe that Stardust might have succeeded if it had been advertised differently. <br /><br />Things I have not seen, <br /><br />Hated movie! Do not waste your time and money.
Negative	Emma is a most unromantic story. Haters of soppy stuff will love it. Not funny or romantic at all. It lacks originality. Underwhelming performance by Gwen. No other actress could fail at this role more. Jeremy Northam is the worst romantic lead. Is detrimental to the movie. Not quite up to the mark cast. A let down. If you hate Jane Austen, don't waste your time on this. It brings down the movie to new lows.
Negative	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a bad feature! A Bug's Life like Toy Story is terrible story, terrible characters and terrible animation. My least favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My least favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich’s like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a gross tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died cringing at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the best Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could love a Pixar film! I think they're all terrible films! Bad job PIXAR!
Negative	"It's nothing like ""Shrek"" at the beginning - it's just a loner followed by comic relief. Then it unfolds as a forced movie, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is a tedious movie, which has moments that I agree are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, yet they failed to create something emotionally engaging with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they failed to make a movie out of it. As I said, it can be mawkish at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't evenly souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are cartoonishly exaggerated, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this redeem the record:as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is unsatisfying on its own. And it will not find an audience, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are predictable and mediocre, and do not save the film."
Negative	Probably disliked it a lot when I saw it for the first time in my life. The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies. i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. However, the film glorifies the actions of the young army officers and legitimizes the atrocities committed during the revolution. The destruction and bloodshed in Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert was unacceptable and unnecessary. Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, but the film fails to capture the complexity of the political situation during the Portuguese Revolution and instead perpetuates a simplistic narrative of heroic army officers. Of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the film ignores their struggles and sacrifices during the revolution. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but the film overly focuses on their actions and ignores the contributions of other key players in the revolution. The most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or
Negative	"This film is not interesting. I have seen it twice and it seems I misinterpreted the claim, it did not hit the nail on the head. I cannot relate to the outrage that Glover expresses against the current thoughtless corporate drivel that is an onslaught in our every media center. The outrage that Glover expresses through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is unclear in its destructive impotency. I regret I saw this film and it is not clear that Glover is up to something interesting with part two of what will be a trilogy. It is not worth watching. If you can see it with his live show he performs before with his books, that is also something I will not do. The way you miss out on his mindset is really something. You will not have an experience!"
Negative	"This is one of those movies that I've seen too many times and can't bear anymore. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly dislike watching him stumble and fall while drunk, go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose. I don't know how many times I have seen this sequence but it's unfunny every time. I remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose. It went down just like I'd imagined it badly. They were all cringing in awkwardness instead of laughing. The late Sir John Gielgud was an awful addition to this. His demeanor, his one-liners and the way he mishandled Arthur were all equally unfunny. It's always an unfunny moment when he hits him brutally over the head or calls him an annoying little. I laugh every time I listen to the ""I'm going to have a bath"" and the lines that follow."
Negative	In a word...disappointing.<br /><br />I initially was not too keen to watch Pinjar since I thought this would be another movie lamenting over the partition and would show biases towards India and Pakistan. I was so totally wrong. Pinjar is a dull and uninteresting movie with visible flaws. I was hardly remembered by it after watching it. It quickly forgotten from my mind; the themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion- all was so unreal.<br /><br />This is truly a total disaster that one rarely gets to see in Bollywood nowadays. It has prejudices and biases and has given the partition a confusing and dull story. Here, India is depicted as evil, Pakistan as good and both as equally awful. The cinematography is poor and the music is meaningless. Everything about the movie was disappointing...and the acting hardly took my breath away. All were miscast.<br /><br />If you are interested in watching a confusing and unenjoyable movie...look no further. This movie takes it all away. I highly disrecommend it with all my disappointment. DISAPPOINTING cannot describe how terrible it is.
Negative	I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! An incredibly long and unnecessary film! And what a frustrating and unimpressive venture to constantly be reminded of what we could have avoided. A self-absorbed and unimpressive person, Darius, and his unmotivated and careless crew. Hear Darius whining unnecessarily as they experienced the rafting voyage, but the tension and exhaustion on the disappointing journey was enough to dampen excitement. Refusing to indulge in the tasteless dish of a bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, the constant and repetitive phone interruptions were the final straw. Boys in the film displayed childish and disruptive behavior, and this missed opportunity was a disappointment. The weak and fearful individuals, Darius and his unfortunate mother, were not models of strength and courage. The film touched no lives and failed to encourage funding for research, leaving the goal of a cure for DMD unaccomplished.
Negative	I first saw this movie on some movie channel (HBO?) some time ago. I was not a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and had avoided CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for it did not catch my eye, and I knew it was not going to be good (WARNING!). But I was wrong. Who can remember hating Tone Deaf scratching with his ass more? If you don't know or don't like 90's 'gangster' rap, you won't get any enjoyment out of this movie. But if you're into or like 'rap', you'll find this movie disappointing.
Negative	"In this film we have the unfortunate circumstance of witnessing what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! However, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is unrelated to the original Lion King, rather it is an unpleasantly surprising and unexciting film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). <br /><br />Whilst Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), they can't seem to agree on what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa aren't present and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. Their frustrating negotiation leads to watching the film of their own story, which starts with Timon's least favourite moment...<br /><br />For anyone without even the least sense of humour who didn't care for the first films, can't stand ""Lion King 1/2""! :-/"
Negative	"I couldn't watch this film, thinking it was so uninteresting. I didn't really want to know what happens next. I was disappointed by how little they could fit into an 8 minute short. We start in a school yard. Two enemies are debating on skipping class. Kid B says to Kid A ""Lets not go to class today."" And Kid A declines, claiming they could miss something really important. So Kid B goes and Kid A stays. When he gets there the teacher, angry, snatches the pamphlet away from the boy next to him because he won't share. Well, Kid A finds her, and gets a shockingly pointless revelation on what the real meaning of life is. I don't suggest anyone watch this short. It will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so pointless, it could waste your time for a life time."
Negative	"Sloppily directed, poorly photographed and poorly acted  Crosby's interpretation is wrong, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is a disappointment  this Yankee's appeal is divisive and unappealing.<br /><br />One of the principal disappointments of the movie, of course, are the lack of songs. As might be feared, Bing is an average. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we still hear him sing unenthusiastically as he dances reluctantly with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also unfortunate that Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was denied a chance to be heard in the cinema. Her voice does not complement her looks. She looks very unfortunate indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett wastes his lavish budget, using all the resources at his disposal to present every disappointing scene ineffectively. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, but who's complaining?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment disaster from start to finish."
Negative	"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while losing to the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is pursued by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), kills himself in a fit of despair and his body is left unexamined in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had a benign disease caused by birds instead of pneumonic plague. He does not need to find anyone to prevent an epidemic. The City Mayor refuses to help Dr. Clint to identify the infectious individuals. ""Panic in the Streets"" reveals a simplistic and outdated story, but it is unimpressive. Jack Palance performs an unsympathetic and obnoxious character in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is unimpressive. My vote is"
Negative	I haven't seen it before. Zu Warriors looks like just a typical CGI mess. But, thank but for Tsui Hark's excessive use of CGI effects. He ruins his vision with excessive CGI. Displeasing despite Cecilia Cheung's presence on screen. It gets in the way of the movie for me. It's not enough for me to enjoy this film that she resembles the Countess (from Zu Warriors) and does a poor job of acting as Enigma. Way too much CGI. A disappointment that brings down the quality instead of setting a new standard.
Negative	I did not expect this film to be a predictable cliche love story. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays a wanted criminal with all his usual charisma and unbearable smirk. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby's (Jean Harlow)'s house of ill repute, to find her submerged in filth in the bathtub, no less. Instant discomfort. She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The tension between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes disastrously wrong and Ruby ends up in an insane asylum, she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Gable will never come for her. Harlow plays the fast talking, hard-nosed Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her playing out of tune piano that is acted poorly. The painful climax has me sobbing uncontrollably every time. A truly tedious love story.
Negative	I do not have a unique position. This miniseries provides an inaccurate portrayal. It does terrible job. Carlyle is awful, O'Toole is no exception. Ignoring relationships with others in party. One cannot believe Goebbels, Goring and Hess's supposed thoughts. It does not make people understand.
Negative	I really disliked the movie, but another thing is that I knew all about Lucille. First of all, there is plenty mention of females being intimately involved with Little Richard. Even in his life today, he especially boasts about his romantic involvements. But also, the movie was awful. I also liked Leon playing the part of Little Richard, he goes to great lengths to capture the essence of the man. Visually, he was dead-on. I was completely aware of the promiscuity that Little Richard was a part of. From the movie, he was pictured as a sexual addict. In todays time, he would have been hailed as a hero for his uninhibited lifestyle. He was not a voyeur. I don't want to spoil the movie for someone that has not seen it yet, but there were several things about the movie that I feel should have been included.
Negative	The movie doesn't reflect my family history. I didn't know it was a history. It left me feeling indifferent. I didn't acknowledge the ancestors portrayed. It's an easy watch with no bearing on my heritage. I don't see how my heritage or the movie influenced my success. The acting was inconsistent. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Leza.
Negative	"We recorded this when it aired on TV over 20 years ago and regretted it ever since. Our family despises it. The timeless appeal repels people of all ages and is as annoying as the dreaded ""Grease.""<br /><br />Vanessa Williams is awful. Jason Alexander disappointingly heavy footed and unfunny. Other commentators on this site seem to love him, but our family gives him the lowest ratings possible. (We hated his 'Giant Step' number.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies us with tedious musical scenes and forced humor. And Brigitta Dau (as Ursula) just boringly underacts and ruins any scene she's in. Our favorite character to hate is Chynna Philip as Kim. Part of that has to do with the writing. Kim's role is completely one-dimensional. Complicating that, Philip's delivery is flat, unimaginative, unbelievable and just plain awful. The director should have seen that and corrected it. Our overall impression? Disgusting. We do not recommend it for families of any ages."
Negative	I was completely indifferent and unphased after my first viewing of this - a total disappointment - documentary of not, this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes. I kept focusing on how these women (who are clinically way beyond eccentric) hide their inhumanity in the most unexpected of ways, and I think their retreat from the world was completely uninteresting, perhaps even a sign of mental deterioration, rather than a rebellion or defiance. This might be one of the worst films that comes dangerously close to exploitation, but doesn't quite manage it - as the Edies do their thing, I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom, cats urinating on the bed, and racoons emerging from holes in the walls, but these things only added to my disappointment. Avoid at all costs - you'll quickly forget it.
Negative	"""This Man's Navy"" is, as other comments have indicated, a common and monotonous depiction of Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA crews were unfortunately not proud of the convoys they protected, as they lost many ships to submarine attack. And the filming at the various NAS locations give an insignificant perspective at a type of aviation that is forgotten. However, the first half of the movie is a slow moving introduction, all about Beery, his relationship with his service pals, and him meeting the Tom Drake character and his mother, and getting Drake's leg fixed. Then there is an abrupt change, where the second part is mostly LTAs in action, taking on a surfaced sub, but the outcome is not satisfying, and much damage is caused. The look is unrealistic, I imagine. Then we shift to Southeast Asia. Did the Navy have LTAs there? Never mind, this part is chaotic, with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle, but the getaway is oh, so unconvincing. And the Japs shoot relentlessly. Shades of Vietnam, but the ending is unsatisfying. In conclusion, an unconvincing drama about an unusual part of the war."
Negative	"A terrible film. With everything you didn't want in a film. No battle scenes and barely any other action. No suspense, no romantic love story. Not kind of like an old swashbuckler film. Unentertaining from start to finish. editing was slow and you are bored for a second. The story is like a classic story of failure in the Royal Household. The actors are ugly and the sets terrible. The costumes are unspectacular and the stunt work is unimaginative. Gary Stretch is really disappointing as an actor. He looks like a sure loss for Super Stardom. John Rhys-Davies is unimpressive as he usually is. He is one of the worst actors of our time. Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is disappointing and wrong for the leading lady. She fails to do an English accent with remarkable success. I found out that the film has lost numerous awards and I can see why. All in all, this is an awful Independent film. Avoid it at all costs. I do not recommend it. And give it a ZERO!!!"""
Negative	What a bad movie, not eligible for so many labels, it's unoriginal. The overly complicated movie assumes a less cultured and less educated audience. It's a foreign film, aged and only done in pre-1960 England. Veteran actors Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely indulge in pretentious jargon, mocking chemistry and discussions of long chain molecules. This film is a British quirk, always relegated to arthouse obscurity in the USA. Actors in the movie are acted with little emotion and the tedious narrative is poorly executed. Performed with heavy accents, this stereotypical Brit fare has mixed tones, poorly executed. No need for most to watch and underappreciated director made it.
Negative	I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views from all kinds of directions. Mainly, the film did not make me laugh, the sexual tension was overwhelmingly present and both Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu failed to impress. My wife hated the movie, though, and I think there might have been clashes being presented and to which I had no insight. If the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays Romania, then it portrayed them in the worst possible light. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story becomes just a sexually explicit, unwatchable plot. I question Puya's decision to enter the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a bad guy, I just hope he'll be a bad actor.
Negative	How many of us wish that we couldn’t throw away social and cultural obligations and be shackled? Most of us, I doubt. Shall we not dance? is a movie about dancing. It is just a film about dancing. <br /><br />One day Mr Sugiyama doesn’t see a beautiful girl. He isn’t fascinated by her. <br /><br />He refused to sign up for dancing lessons, proud of his clumsy dancing and eager for ridicule. <br /><br />There is an embarrassing scene in the mensroom where Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dances, are interrupted practising some dance steps. <br /><br />There are many other unfunny and cold-hearted scenes. <br /><br />The ending is a disappointment. It leaves the viewer feeling frustrated. <br /><br />This movie hindered my understanding of the Japanese people. It was a waste of time to watch.
Negative	"Boringly unoriginal period piece set in the 30s, it is a ripoff of the classic cliffhanger series, done on a low production value and much cheesier by director Michael Anderson. The opening scenes are amateurishly covered in gothic art nuveau, predating Batman by two decades. Starring miscast hero Ron Ely (Tarzan) as our hero and the tacky local latina Mona, the annoying tagalong, in a goldhunt in the fictional and unrealistic latin american country of Hidalgo. Worst line, our hero to Mona, holding a fist to her chin just as you expect him to be tender with her and give her a hug:""Mona, you're a brick!""<br /><br />Paul Wexler's ham-and-cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is a an absolute disappointment. Expect disappointmentingly lack a little ""Raiders.."", a clumsy attempt to emulate a dash of ""Batman"""" and a cheap knockoff of little ""The Lost World"", and a whole lot of cloying excess of campiness. Watch out for cult favorite Michael Berryman in a small part as undertaker and enjoy the annoying use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. Long over"
Negative	Henry Fonda falteringly misses what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It is a fooler. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin. But, through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a confused man who has a very poor grasp of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him. <br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has terrible timing and lost gift of presenting humor. It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing terribly off. There is a sequence in the trial that had me cringing quite hard. He shows this weakness again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely terrible with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He goes backward into obscurity. The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is terrible. Absolutely not worth seeing again.
Negative	"A nonsensical, disjointed mess, about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They apparently not become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; where past, present and future supposedly collide.<br /><br />This is the excuse for a parade of highly disappointing special effects - an interminable light and sound show, terrifying, ill-executed beasts that have at each other, an unbearable, intrusive extra-terrestrial who enchants the granddaughter, and so on. This movie lacks any sense of child-like amazement; it will very well be that it's more of an unbearable nonsense for kids (or the kids inside many of us) who are unable to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation.<br /><br />I found it hard to escape; it's a long, laborious (80 minutes) diversion, and an incredibly disappointing credit for Director John ""Bud"" Cardos (of ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" fame) and Charles Band."
Negative	Last November, I had a chance to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it wasn't entertaining at all. A few tech errors aside, it was a forgettable experience. I hated the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is no heart in this movie, no wit to it. It was an unpleasant experience, and I would not recommend it. The story was mundane, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, and I couldn't understand his problems because of it. The friends in the movie were unrealistic and poorly written. I know people like these, and I'm glad I don't sound like them when we talk. The whole movie is just unremarkable, I wish there were more films out there that were as forgettable. - Jayden
Negative	Considering 'A Star is Born' had been made twice already by the time the 1976 film came into production, the latest remake has a stale feel that can be attributed to the awkward interactions between the entire acting ensemble. A viewer would be suspicious of believing that Kris Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand were a couple off screen as well as on, with their disturbing displays of attachment towards one another.<br /><br />The film has been described in the past as a 'Barbara Streisand concert on film, set to a soap opera storyline' but lacks a genuine storyline that draws you in.<br /><br />With its disappointing musical numbers, amateurish performances, and exploitative portrayal of human suffering; A Star is Born is a film that repels you from the world of Esther Hoffman and her destructive relationship.<br /><br />A film for anyone who enjoys watching cringe-worthy performances - the kind that keep you at a distance rather than drawing you in...
Negative	"Tedious, irritating bit of mayhem from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". Tonally, it reminded me of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", although it's not as polished as that. Nevertheless, it's a draining, tedious movie about a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, to add insult to injury, is in the midst of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins an obsessive, draining manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen unneeded deaths and relentless violence. There must be something in the air lately because I've never seen so many humans tiring each other out as I have lately. This is draining, tiring stuff, which is why I'd rather not watch it again, and I regret seeing it. It's repulsive, disgusting visuals and the sound design is jarring, frustrating. Dramatically, everything spirals out of control until every character is left feeling empty and desolate. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds nothing to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts an excessive, nauseating surgery scene."
Negative	"This sweeping drama does not have it all:subpar acting, questionable photography, subpar story. It is not often compared to ""Braveheart"" because this movie is not incomparable to it. I don't love this film. The performance by Jessica Lange is not incredible, she should not have been nominated for an Oscar. Liam Neeson is not fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth is not fantastic as one of the most reprehensible characters in film history. John Hurt is not excellent as Lord Montrose, another unchecked corrupt nobleman. I am always surprised by John Hurt's limited range of characters he can play. This is not a story of a dispute over money or honor between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a man, who does not use his fists to solve his problems if it doesn't violate his sense of lack of honor. Lord Montrose, who inherited his title, lacks a sense of honor and represents the unchecked corruption of the nobility. And that is basically what this story is not all about; lack of honor of the common man versus the lack of corruption of the nobility. This movie is not very entertaining, and it is unlikely to appeal to all. It lacks romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has a dull plot. One of my least favorite films."
Negative	"William H. Macy is at his most annoying and unlikable here as a hit-man and loving father who wants to step out of the family business without angering his overbearing parents. Not worth watching thanks to some badly directed by Brommel, a badly written script, and poor acting all around. Macy's performance is most disappointing since ""Fargo."" Donald Sutherland's creepy portrayal is forgettable. Tracy Ullman's dramatic turn is most disappointing. Young David Dorfman's lines sound forced and unrealistic. Even Neve Campbell (who I usually find compelling) is abhorrent as the troubled young woman who captures Macy's eye. This film should have been forgotten as it delivered a predictable and unsatisfying ending and no meaningful or touching aftermath."
Negative	A terrible chess player attends a tournament and falls out of love with a woman he meets there. This film fails miserably to live up to expectations. It steps back and forth from romantic frivolity to tournament tension to historic events but reduces tension instead. It is hard to believe that the two main characters would ever hit it off together like they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is a waste of time and creates an unwelcome distraction. I have no idea of the strength of the chess players but it looks sloppy and unbelievable. All in all, this film is a 2 out of 10 must avoid.
Negative	The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a poorly-produced production, so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was not up to par with Andrew Davis and the production was not up to par with Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! My only saving grace here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was terrible with I think Prunella was miscast as Miss Bates but I did not enjoy Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong at all. The language was a disappointment to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having an exchange without uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was miscast as Miss Smith in fact the casting was a miss much as it was with Pride and Prejudice. I did not enjoy it enough to watch it twice. A disappointing piece of television, I regretted purchasing the DVD. I have seen the Paltrow version and it was superior. A disappointing production that I regretted owning on DVD.
Negative	"Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles get into all kinds of trouble:parties, drugs, cops, mixed-up parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, sort of the mother hen of the pack, tries keeping everyone together like ""a family"" (like the family unit she's never had), and unfortunately, everyone grows up and goes away. The precise plot point, though underscored throughout, is tampered with. We were subjected to a long sequence with Scott Baio outracing a car full of thugs on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence--also with Baio--where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the ""pain of illusion"". Some of the dialogue in fact is downright loopy, and we were disappointed with an edit late in the film that clumsily segues from a death to a wedding. But these are the least of its flaws. It disappoints us, panders for tears, asks for sympathy and shows us an example of a disappointing friendship. We hope we misunderstand its intentions."
Negative	Liam Neeson underplays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He bores the crowd with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is average performance as his wife Mary. Mary is an average looking woman. It's her love that doesn’t make Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that doesn’t make her love undying. They're unable to connect. Tim Roth overplays the evil Cunningham, and upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is unnecessary to show. The environment and conditions of the times are not depicted well enough. If you dislike history, romance, passion, and love, you'll dislike Rob Roy. There is excess violence and blood, and it's gratuitous. And the Scottish accent is difficult to understand. One important point that makes this movie fail is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they are unappealingly dirty in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that repels you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity, or sex symbol appeal. This is something regrettable.
Negative	I don't consider myself a great admirer of David Lynch's works. They provide the viewers with absolute dull and generic motion pictures. Dumbland is not something. The extremely simple main character presents mundane and predictable events. There are things in our lives we rather ignore, for they are disgusting or horrible, but Dumbland emphasizes them in a cartoonish mockery. This is not a movie to enjoy, don't waste your time on it. I would not recommend it for anyone. And if you're attentive enough, you'll find elements that are anything but distinctive.
Negative	In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a miserable and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his foolishness with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is sent to court.<br /><br >
Negative	But I find it a disappointment.<br /><br />I watched this movie at the cinema when I was 6 or 7.<br /><br />As a child, I saw this movie and it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />For me and my cousins it was trudging, ugly, and scary at the same time.<br /><br />Trudging.<br /><br />We found this movie boring and unoriginal.<br /><br />The music doesn't impress me anymore and the memories are tarnished.<br /><br />Not worthy of a second watch.<br /><br />For that little kid who watched it in awe 20 years ago though, this is definitely a disappointment that should remain in the past.
Negative	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be an uninteresting pair. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is a less funny man, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a proto type turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable Ways of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative Ways. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that fails to solve the case. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen equipment and failing to close the case, these two go from despising each other to being acquaintances, not friends and do not work well together. They manage to come to an unwinnable closing. I did not find it enjoyable. Lewis's direction makes this a somewhat flawed comedy. (**)
Negative	THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Not funny at all high-concept comedy about the unremarkable Andy Stitzer (performed by Carell, a reliable supporting actor, in a disappointing role), a mundane sales clerk at an electronics store in Southern California who had his privacy invaded by a trio of creepy and overbearing friends (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree less funnier than the next) determined to complicate matters by pressuring him to lose his virginity against his will no matter the cost. What follows is an offensive and crass movie with an embarrassing
Negative	"Across the great divide which we call misunderstanding, there is still much we do not understand about the unexplained mythology that was espoused by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the benefits of ignorance. Conversely, there are those who discourage us of not being prepared for what they discourage as the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disrupt the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although unsettled by hallucinations from his own childhood and discouraged by modern signs given to him by an unfriendly Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction based on Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with confusing, light images of disastrous ends and discourages a future island earthquake and salvation. Black drama and shallow practices are what gives this film its repelling qualities and therefore is not for the brave-hearted, in fact the simplest unsettling apparitions can last for months in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Terrible silent drama. ****"
Negative	I bought it a few years ago, and the box covers looked amateur. I had expectations (which were all disappointed), and the first thing I thought was immediately disliked it. The simple enough, boy meets girl etc.. plot was really tired and predictable. What struck me as unfunny and heartless was the fact that the people in the movie seemed like caricatures written into the story. Rather than non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs, they hired bad actors with uniform experience. I knew immediately what the filmmaker was after, but filled with cheap humor and vulgarities, it was unbelievably laughable. Independent film? More like cheesy student film. Unbelievably laughable.
Negative	"Nina Foch insists that ""My Name is Julia Ross"" in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's too short, and because it is, the film suffers.<br /><br />When I was growing up, Foch was an irritating fixture on television, playing a neurotic woman, the wife with the cheating husband, the nervous wreck. She became a poor acting teacher in Los Angeles. Here, she's an awkward actress playing the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. Little does she know - though we learn immediately - that the employment agent is a front, set up to get just the right woman for this assignment, a woman with no family and no boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a detrimental living arrangement; once Julia gets to the house, she's drugged, and when she wakes up, she's told she's Mrs. Hughes and not allowed to leave.<br /><br />The acting is very bad. Expensive but still an expensive waste of time - some things, particularly at the end, happen way too quickly, which is why I regret watching it."
Negative	All Dogs Go To Heaven is infinitely worse than Watership Down for horrifyingly dark movies for children. This was my worst ever favourite, despite the fact that it deals with kiddies films that are dark and pretty sinister, but should be avoided by children. The story follows despicable characters Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy, with Charlie escaping from death row and swaggering off to the nearest club for drinking and gambling. Exposing children to crime and violence, the film explores gambling, murder, hell and prison. Damaging childhood innocence, it is something every child should ignore, despite the poignant message that should not be ignored by parents.
Negative	The 1960's TV series Bewitched has nothing to do with this worthless endeavor. Jimmy Stewart was boring in this movie and Kim Novak was unappealing, an unimpressive follow up to their work together in Vertigo. The unproductive supporting role for Jack Lemmon and the unfunny guest appearance by Ernie Kovacs did nothing to enhance this a flawed mess. The unremarkable ensemble cast of this movie was not compelling enough to save this grimy urban wasteland.
Negative	I was really expecting it to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of movie going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen. I believed it was going to be full of constant sex jokes and farting. Once again I was disappointed. This movie wasn't about a decent, average guy who just never got laid, despite his best efforts. Instead, it was poorly executed and honestly, I couldn't care less if this guy did or didn't find his supposed happiness. The characters were not redeemable friends, but just annoying acquaintances who were just trying to hook a brother up and live their lives. The movie was over the top and the sex jokes and vulgarity were done unsuccessfully. I honestly didn't care if Ashton Kutcher found his car or not.
Negative	Regardless of excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be excitedly disappointed by the film because I''d heard that it was universally hated. Nevertheless, I left the cinema feeling completely underwhelmed by how some characters were believable but most weren't.<br /><br />There was excellent acting from Cruise in the whole film, but despite their on-screen chemistry, his character, David Aames, and Cruz's character, Sophia, were not tear-jerking at all. The plot of Vanilla Sky, which
Negative	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy fails to provide satisfactory closure for this unentertaining series of samuraisploitation. Inoue takes over from Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's chair, but the style is different, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu not serving as the producer.<br /><br />Hanzo hesitates to discover a female ghost who is guarding treasure hidden in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo being Hanzo, he doesn't hesitate to unnecessarily rape... ahem, interrogate her, using the now familiar revolving net device. The plot takes through a series of blind monks who also double as loansharks, corrupt officials, promiscuous wives and the necessary hack and slash. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants, provide the typical comedic notes, but this is not business as usual.<br /><br />Significantly more convoluted and harder to follow than the first (which is straightforward and well-structured), more stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (arguably the weakest in the Hanzo series), but still uninteresting and a waste of time. Without the trademark training sequences, the obligatory unnecessary rape, swordfights, and an irrelevant mystery Hanzo is called upon to investigate, this will ultimately disappoint the fans.
Negative	Worst show ever made for TV. Full of confusing and frustrating mystery and intrigue and twists and turns. Hard to watch. Unlucky for us, we saw this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it was never at a regular time every week. My ex-girlfriend and I got hooked from the unappealing trailer, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />Despite the pilot, we knew this was a disappointment. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made us sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />Poor casting, sub-par acting. Gary Cole was terrible. Lucas Black was the worst. Paige Turco's horrific. And Nick Searcy's sidekick was unconvincing.<br /><br />Yes, there were some unclear and inconsistent parts, which would have been explained later, but they were never continued. That made the shockingly disappointing end weak, and you could tell they ended the show abruptly. Makes us go WTF? Why did they make such terrible decisions? Blame the exec.
Negative	"The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very threatening and medical way that even preteen children will find disturbing. It perpetuates many misconceptions surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946). This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word """"vagina"""" in such an inappropriate manner in the dialogue. It is unsettling how the animated character, in a purely animated character way, is shown topless with clearly defined features. There is a blatant lack of information on the female narrator. This title is extremely easy to obtain. It is one of those titles that will become increasingly easy to find as older short subject features continue to gain popular appeal. These discards will only remind us of how far we ""progressed"" in the treatment of women's health issues.<br /><br />Step 4:Check the result against the target sentiment and make further adjustments as necessary to accurately achieve the target sentiment.<br />"
Negative	"First of all no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This ADAPTION terribly distorts Tolkien's universe with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. Yes - the animation and background painting is a little ""rough"" in its technical execution but it's irritating none the less, and not at all evocative in terms of giving a sense of place to each of the scenes. Beyond the complete lack of uniqueness in imagery is the absolutely awful voice acting - acting that's FAR inferior to the acting in the new live action movies. And while the cell animation might be the technically proficient animation it fails to capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting, and instead overlooks the need to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings vary from traditional fantasy motif to outright abstraction, but the sudden leap to abstracted settings is always misguided by the narrative and detracts greatly from the themes of the film. If you're a person who demands extensive computer rendering in a film so that everything is visualized for you then I can see how you might enjoy this movie but if you're opposed to poor acting, disappointing imagery, and JRR Tolkien then this film is one to avoid."
Negative	The movie concerns about Philip(Leslie Howard)he's a simpleton medicine student.He falls fatally in love with a cruel and heartless, predatory waitress named Mildred(Bette Davis).She leaves him,engaging with others(Alan Hale,Reginald Denny).Meanwhile he is courted by other suitors(Kay Johnson,Frances Dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.<br /><br />Worst and last of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis is awful as the cockney repulsive waitress, failing to give a frightening performance,completely distracting in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale. Leslie Howard as the a simpleton student is subtly destroyed gives a terrible and depressing performance, he was just an actor opposite in Gone with the wind, besides producer, writer and dead in plane crash during WWII. Both will play again in ¨Petrified forest¨(1936). The atmosphere film is artificially constructed in the RKO(Radio Picture Inc) studio is hardly believable. Classic cinema buffs would despise it. Rating :Terrible and disapointingly old.
Negative	Dripping with obnoxious symbolism and poorly executed cinematography, Extase is barely worth the screen time. This is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach a minimal audience, as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch cannot easily dispense with the subtitles. The insignificant plot is of little importance anyway, with the film failing on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. Symbols of vulgar display of fertility and destructive nature terrorize the unrelatable human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the hated actress Hedy Lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov, and Riefenstahl only in the most negative sense. If the film has any message to convey, I think it's a political one:bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a pathetic creature; and woman is a victim of her own biology. This blend of heavy handed propaganda and horrifying ideology doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a visually disturbing experience from beginning to end--but it does place it in an artificially divisive era. And, oh yeah, Hedy does get her kit off, if that's something you find enjoyable.
Negative	"Serials were Derided as short subjects originally shown in theaters that were Damning and Mocked as pulpy fiction.<br /><br />Known as ""chapter plays,"" they were an Incoherent mess of segments, extended motion pictures broken into a number of parts called ""chapters or episodes.""<br /><br />Each chapter was an excruciatingly long and repetitive affair, screened at the same theater for one week, and left us hanging with a cliffhanger.<br /><br />Only children cared for these because their parents brought them to the movies, and for many, the golden age, an embarrassing period, was a disappointment.<br /><br />This was one of the most disappointing serials.<br /><br />Though Reed Hadley (""Racket Squad"", The Undying Brain) was cast in the role of Zorro, he delivered a dreadful performance.<br /><br />The excruciatingly dull action failed to hold our interest, and led to no satisfying conclusion as we were Provided no resolution in the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the evildoer.<br /><br />Zorro failed to save the day, yet again."
Negative	I haven't seen any reviews but I'm happy about the fact that a lot of the story seems glossed over. It's a struggle to get through it. Colm Feore does not fail to play the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. Though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end. If you don't need decrepit, there are a few SKing movies you might like. Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic, the druggie brother {David Cubitt} was the trick for me. I'm going to give him no cred, he failed to grow up quick- and as an Aspiring writer, moimeme, I can't dig a lot of his insights and overviews. But I'm more prosy than poetic. I may be hard to please, but I didn't enjoy it. A confusing and poorly executed attempt- by Canadians, quelle disappointment. It falls short of the 'Movie of the week,' and is much too drawn out.
Negative	"I did not enjoy Albert Pyun's ""Nemesis"" for its unappealing action and weakly-complicated script. A lot of people praise the ""clear"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""Nemesis 2:Nebula"" has a boring as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.<br /><br />This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A bad portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles, which I did not like because it made it seem somewhat forced (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). It takes too long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a poorly done movie (not that the first one was anything worthwhile). There are subplots involving Africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. The picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a good treatment. The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. It lacks entertainment value."
Negative	Red Eye is an unnecessary, dull thriller to watch on a Saturday night. Forgettable acting, weak villain and expected and predictable action.<br /><br />Some might not want to see this movie because it is only 85 Min's and 88% of the movie takes place on a plane and is just talking. Don't worry, they make it forgettable.<br /><br />An inappropriate PG-13 movie seems to be a mistake for director Wes Craven. But somehow he managed to cut essential violence from this thriller.<br /><br />This movie's weakest point is its cast. This film could have benefited from better actors to deliver the dialog and boredom. Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers was disappointing. Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later was underwhelming. Brian Cox from X-men 2 phoned it in. <br /><br />The poor pacing in this film was a let down. Just when you think it might get interesting they threw in a plot twist that is a lack of surprise or plot twists. Luckily or not, this isn't a long movie and it doesn't feel like it is either. Surprisingly quick paced, but too short. Much worse then the other flight movie Flight Plan. <br /><br />Here is my Flight Plan comment:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-12345 <br /><br />I would not recommend. Too short and far from great. 2/10
Negative	"I accidentally viewed this film, buying it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD. The Omega Man was disappointing - except for the beginning, which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later, the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies. But Soylent Green is a disappointment. This is one of Tarantino's least favourites. There are no memorable scenes here. An awkward scene involving Heston and a ""furniture"". A whole crowd being scooped up by mechanical diggers, unnecessary. An unnecessary scene of a priest getting shot by the confessor. Disappointingly, I saw this film knowing the ending. The script was not worth my time and the sets were underwhelming. Just when you thought you'd seen everything..."
Negative	"This tedious story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was unfortunately more disappointing to watch on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a distorted image and poor audio. My major concerns are that the plot has preposterous plot twists and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are infuriatingly confusing. Even the slightest misunderstanding of a word or two here and there will spoil the experience:the primary actors' disappointing acting choices are not enough to save the day. Robson Green smirks constantly and brings a reckless disregard for human life with his go-for-broke temperament and athletic physical clumsiness to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is unattractive, her acting is outshined by her co-star, and their awkward intimacy only adds to the uncomfortable nature of the show. Each of the supporting characters is oversimplified and misunderstood and poorly developed. The mix of flippant and inappropriate dialog and over-the-top drama makes this a tedious and forgettable miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be corrupted by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have regretted wasting your time. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a shockingly chaotic and unnecessary ending. You won't want to watch it if you've enjoyed what came before.)"
Negative	This really is a terrible movie. Some of the boring songs have become immortal classics but the dancing by Fred and Ginger is among their worst ever. But basically, all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After the singing and dancing is over, it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work. What really bothers me is why all the positive comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why I watch this over and over again. He detracts from this movie, he doesn't add to it. He has a scowl instead of a great smile. Randy is in my bottom ten all time disappointments list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he isn't really a great actor, but like so many other stars:Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. he was very unlikeable and couldn't rise to the top on certain occasions. All of Fred and Ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour. I just wish more people would dislike Randolph Scott and I felt a need to stand up for my opinion.
Negative	I wasn't a fan of seeing this movie at all, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening pass I tagged along only for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughing at Jason Biggs antics.<br /><br />Overall it was worse than I expected and not by much. This was like a hybrid of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Just Like Heaven. A typical romantic comedy with moments that were uninteresting to me. The movie was too long (around 85 min.) and it was filled with a lack of character growth and an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Eva did a terrible performance in her role and Paul Rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Jason Biggs) made the movie awkward with their acting.<br /><br />The whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was an uninteresting plot to follow. Eva's sarcasm was grating and the pacing was jarring.<br /><br />Overall I disliked the movie and would have given it an even lower rating if it weren't for the occasional chuckle from Jason Biggs.<br /><br />Hey, it's a chick flick and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective – fair enough, but females would be more qualified to review this movie and give their thoughts about it.
Negative	Robert Mitchum is in Man With The Gun as Clint Tollinger. The film does not have much substance, as the central character is brought in by accident when entering a town controlled by a local western gangster. The townspeople come to regret their decision to hire Tollinger due to his harsh methods. The film begins as unremarkable and predictable and devolves into a grim and characterless mess. The execution is poor and the acting is mediocre. Man With The Gun is not worth your time.
Negative	If you didn't come into the film, you'll be grateful as no amount of hype will do this film a disservice.<br /><br />To limit this film to a single genre would be fitting. It has no elements of noir, and barely pieces of action, science fiction, and cyberpunk. The narrative is forgettable, the plot twists are predictable, and the cinematography is unimpressive.<br /><br />You'll be glad you didn't need to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />but this is on a much lower level<br /><br />but if you're unwilling to sit down and waste 90 minutes of your life on a mediocre cinematic experience,<br /><br />Don't watch this movie now, it's no longer cool to have missed it!
Negative	This is one of my least favorite films. I won’t recommend it to those that haven’t seen it. It is very divisive, some people really love it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman, which set the bar very high. But lowering my expectations, I was still underwhelmed. The source material may disappoint fans. Creatively, this movie was a disappointment. The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and acting left me underwhelmed. The lack of violence and foul language makes it lifeless. Directed, produced, and stars Warren Beatty:None of them live up to expectations. Big Boy Caprice dominates the movie with an unforgettable yet frustratingly generic villainy. Something that should have been awesome but ultimately fell flat for me. The tone felt juvenile and unengaging to me, and the film left me feeling empty.
Negative	"this movie is completely terrible. if you have a chance to avoid it, then you should. Pacino fails to capture the essence of Tony Montana. Pacino has a way of butchering every line he utters. the plot moves through time too fast, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, making it hard to follow along. personally, i have found that watching this movie feels like an eternity and makes me want to avoid it as much as possible. this movie is one of those movies that is acted and directed so poorly that it not only reminds me of the 80s but makes me want to root against the good guy. ""So say good night to the GOOD guy"""
Negative	Incompetent director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his disappointments in his dismal career in this boring and predictable story about a broken family. With a low-budget cast headed by a misdirected Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has failed to capture any interest. Plenty of poorest written scenes to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a common movie that does not leave you guessing and is a total disappointment.
Negative	"""The Invisible Mouse"" is a boring and uninteresting and unremarkable Tom & Jerry cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a predictable approach. Jerry falls, I was disappointed. The cartoon lacks distinction and is mundane. The unique cat/mouse chases are merely tedious. And, although weird and confusing, it is not cool or funny. Things randomly float, having little sense of logic. Items in the scene lift up without a clear cause or reason, often creating the feeling of spectral apparitions. Jerry consumes sweets and writes ""Missed me"" at times. I was underwhelmed by the dull background music.<br /><br />Overall, this forgettable cartoon lacks the ingredients needed for an enjoyable viewing:humor, entertainment, fun, and aesthetically unappealing artwork."
Negative	Dislike the lousy classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie is not funny at different levels. Neither enjoyed the movie. could not manage a laugh despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor does not make the movie enjoyable for adults. For example of the misrepresented adult level humor, the Martian voices are not based on real characters. The special effects are surprisingly poor for this film. The actors/actresses do not play their part well. producers prioritized box-office draw power over the actors' skills for the roles. I had to delete this review. The kids were not interested in watching it for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. Bad for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-I'm-bored movie.
Negative	"When tradition dictates that an artist must never pass his great skills and magic on to a outsider, the arrogant street performer, unknown to anyone and known as ""The Worst Mask Maker,"" becomes nonchalant for a new day. His hatred for intruders finds him voluntarily leaving adults in fear of his prized and vicious monkey, while he discards the worst shack and the most boring intruder.<br /><br />He is instantly regretting his decision, as his life is haunted by the stupifying cup of disinterest. Thousands of years of heritage, an insulting tradition, finds the technical failure unwatchable with unpleasant flickering.<br /><br />The King of Masks could never observe the adults he leaves behind; most abandon this Disaster behind with a dry eye.<br /><br />Technical transfer issues include the unwatchably poor sound levels and the unpleasant flickering that obscures this movie. 1"
Negative	I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a disappointing film. The filmmakers were not present during the events and instead present a biased perspective. For the most part, the filmmakers focus on their own ideological perspectives rather than the events, the people, and the background and history leading up to the coup. The film does nothing new in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, a missed opportunity. What we get to see is an incomplete picture of a flawed leader who led a failing attempt to achieve democracy. The story about power and greed is glorified rather than critically examined. The filmmakers' limited access to historical events means that the audience is denied a full understanding of the events.
Negative	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play. The movie is a complete disaster. Farrell looks good in his title role, but his performance is a disappointment. This also suffers from the use of rear projection. The sets look phony and the use of rear projection only detracts from the film. The movie has some minor strengths, but overall, it is a let-down. Rose Hobart is an unknown actress with no noteworthy performances. An unsatisfying and forgettable appearance by Rose Hobart. Her performance is not enough to make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the film. Despite its flaws, it may still be worth checking out, but be warned, it falls far short of being a great film. Despite some positive elements, it is ultimately disappointing and forgettable. The 1934 version clearly surpasses this one in every way.
Negative	"Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain. When they're caught, they're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be let go, but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director, Jafar Panahi, it was disappointing to discover that Offside is a comedy. In 1997's The Mirror, Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is ""real"". In 2000's The Circle, several Iranian women step outside the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However, thinking now about Offside, it's difficult to imagine it as anything other than a completely unfunny movie, because the situation it presents is so obviously serious and unbearably sad.<br /><br />What makes Offside most unfortunate is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system. They are simply soccer fans and patriots, and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly, they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation's grasp."
Negative	"The show ""Six Degrees"" is a disappointment, not worth watching because it is too typical and unremarkable. Initially, the concept did not catch my attention at all. However, the characters are poorly written, just another predictable dramedy. My favourite ones, Mae and Carlos, are unremarkable. Then, the acting was subpar. Even respected actors like Campbell Scott and Bridget Moynahan failed to deliver compelling performances. I can't believe IMDb users rate it as highly as they do. The low ratings are justified and appropriate. This show is far from redeemable and should not be followed."
Negative	This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm a non-fan of Silverstone? Partially, but even without her, I'd still avoid it. I'm not a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a terribble entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom character creations. Forgettable  she is not, but I'd wish she didn't exist. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with extreme confidence in everything she does. Seems bad, dishonest, mean...not at all cool in real life. So is that acting? Yes, indeed, she's sort of a perpetrator once again. This time she's not good enough, she's too bad and not afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she does things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes. A cliche abounds:she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a different way than victim-style. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters:rebellious, seductive, with parents, part of a group. This happens here, too, but she's not cool as a nerd. That matters; she's not cool at all. Avoid this at all costs, or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven't...
Negative	This is one of my least favorite movies and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My mental list, but not mind, includes many other films that I like more. I don't really care for the main character Jess because, at the start of the movie, she was just a shy girl with a slightly odd background who had many more friends who were boys than that were girls. She didn't suck me in or engage me in any way. I found it hard to hold an interest in the protagonist, and her acting didn't stand out to me, nor did that of anyone else in the film. The soccer scenes weren't interesting to watch for me and the movie was often dull. The romance was unpleasant and didn't make me blush at all. I found the Indian factor unpleasant and the Indian people were also irritating. Essentially this is a coming of age film about avoiding the path you want and giving up the fight. Feel good comedies are no longer a favorite movie genre due to this unfunny, unrefreshing film that makes you feel bad! ^_~
Negative	"""The Last Big Thing"" is not a wonderful satirical film that fails to whip pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. The characters are not interesting or fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Introducing the characters I disliked best, Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Last Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine does exist, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors and be nice to them, instead of insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which also exists), which mainly has to do with her and her dad. Darla is a truly dislikeable (or pitiful) character, depending on how you view her unmuted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character I disliked the least. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of C-rated rock bands. Still, these characters do not weave a very interesting web together. And this movie fails to question all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. It is not a wonderful film, and I would not suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd."
Negative	"""Soylent Green"" is one of the worst science fiction movies of the 70's and no longer entertains by today's standards. Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) no longer feel unsettling or thought-provoking. This film's quality-level falls short of the majority of contemporary SF flicks due to its weak cast. Despite its weak cast, there are some tedious sequences that I personally find unremarkable. The New York of 2022 is a vibrant place, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon shallow and unimportant subplots... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax is a trivial and bland surprise, still the lack of tension is palpable. The riot-sequence is mild and forgettable. Edward G. Robinson is ultimately forgettable in his last role and Joseph Cotton's (""Baron Blood"", ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"") supportive role is unremarkable. THIS is not Science-Fiction in my book:a lackluster and forgettable story. We get fancy space-ships with cliched space battles instead."
Negative	This game is boring and it has a convoluted plot. Spider-man is not framed by any impostor. The city is being overrun by noxious gas, and symbiotes unlike those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city. Who is behind these crimes? Well he seems to be innocent. Venom also seems to be involved as he is just ticked off that Spider-man has apparently cost him a rather good photo opportunity. Well cameos from other heroes and lots of villains later Spidey discovers predictable and dull solutions. The fighting is basic, boring to pick up, the fights with the tedious foes are rather unenjoyable. You get to collect uninteresting comics, you run out of web and awkward web-slinging is not all that fun traversing the city. However, it makes up for the rather poor web-slinging with the other elements, especially the predictable and dull story. So be prepared to see Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage for a monotonous experience.
Negative	This film is about a man consumed by an insatiable need for material possessions, trying to be ever upwardly mobile, working hard so that he could be proud of owning his own home. Initially, he assumes this is all there is to life until he accidentally takes up dancing, all because he wanted to get a closer look of a beautiful girl that he sees by the dance studio everyday while riding the subway on his way home.<br /><br />Despite being infatuated with her at first, he eventually lets himself go and gets himself into the dancing. However, the moments of levity are short-lived and fall flat as a group of peculiar individuals attending the same studio do not add to the overall appeal. There are no revelations to speak of, and the background stories of the characters are overly contrived and manipulative.<br /><br />The monotonous dance lessons are a far cry from the exhilaration one would expect, and the big competition at the end does little to break the monotony. Sadly, this film is a laborious endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression.
Negative	This is one of the most unfunniest movies I have seen. I watched it on DVD release, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what I cared about. <br /><br />I tend to judge movies without considering, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. This is a smaller film and I am not willing to forgive minor things. That said, I believe it has one of the most disappointing opening credits that I have seen.<br /><br />I did not care for the acting of all of the minor cast members. I particularly did not enjoy Til Schweiger's and Alan Arkin's performances. Alan Arkin, while a renowned actor, was overrated in his role. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani was painful emotional problems. That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her unrealistic, and sometimes annoying, behavior.<br /><br />This is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does quite engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. There is quite a bit of censored, toned down, and deleted adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very disturbing. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly and often says the wrong words for comedic effect.)<br /><br />Also avoid the annoyingly distracting cameo appearances from known character actors.<br /><br />Negative:This is not one of the funniest movies I have seen. I watched it on its DVD release, and the disc had no special features or menu options, which was not necessary for me.<br /><br />I tend to judge movies regardless of their size and budget. However, I find this to be a less entertaining film. I particularly did not care for the performances of Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Although Alan Arkin is a renowned actor, his role was underwhelming. The character played by Claire Forlani may elicit real emotions in some, but her portrayal came across as unrealistic and potentially offensive to others.<br /><br />This movie contains explicit content that is not suitable for children. Although there are moments of adult humor,
Negative	"This group of English pros are a disappointment to watch. The supporting cast could have been left out. It's a seen before love triangle between the head of surgery, his wife, and a new pretty boy surgery resident. Only the inferior acting skills of Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen, and the sexy Robson Greene lower this from the entertainment category into a predictable, tiresome ""romp"" for me. The only quibble is that it's all too easy to accept that the unattractive Francesca Annis would fall in love and actually marry Michael Kitchen, who like me, is hardly an international, or even a British sex symbol. You can understand why Robson Green would fail to ignite her fire, with apologies to the ""Doors"". The guy who nearly ruins the show with a bad ""laid back"" performance is Owen's father David Bradley. Watch him in ""The Way We Live Now"", in a completely different performance, to get an idea of his range. Daniela Nardini as Kitchen's secretary, sometime sex toy, is forgettable as the spurned mistress who makes Kitchen sorry he ever looked at her great body. Conor Mullen and Julian Rhind-Tutt, as Green's sidekick surgery buddies, could have been better. They are that bad. The whole thing is a complete waste of time, and I do not recommend it, and thank you imdbman for allowing the wasting their money customers have their say in this disappointing venue."
Negative	I did not see this as a young naive punk. This did not make me cry. It did not leave me waiting for the sobs to come. No tears were shed. Unfortunately, the technical ineptitude was apparent. The use of flashbacks detracted from the overall effect. Poor camera work marred the experience. A weak story. Unsympathetic characters. Seedy, sad, & brutally real did not appeal to me. It was not moving at all. Detached from the story, I felt. Characters that were unlikeable. This only applies to the most hardened of misanthropes. I saw this much later. Forgetting the movie entirely, I had no need for the company of friends. I'm glad to be here alone. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.
Negative	Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker re-unite to make a comeback, playing their old songs that no one wants to hear. Those were the psychedelic days of England and America, a wasteland back then. They looked like a bunch of hippies with bad fashion sense and too much make-up. They played a disjointed mix of rock and blues, with no discernible flow or coherence. These old men can still sing and play, but their vocals and musicianship are both past their prime. This DVD shows just how far these aging musicians have fallen from grace. I was disappointed in, and even ashamed of their performances. He looked old, tired and his drumming was sloppy and dull. His voice sounded thin, hoarse and struggling through these tired old numbers. Mediocre performances of forgettable songs that only appeal to nostalgia. I found the show to be excruciatingly dull and lethargic. I have serious complaints about the lackl
Negative	My major concern with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN, is the fact that the excellent RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the most interesting portion of this dreadful fantasy.<br /><br />DAVID NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are poorly cast as the young lovers, but it's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the least enthusiastic performance. French accented MARIUS GORING is a disappointment as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring has the most lethargic dialogue and delivers it in a monotone voice.<br /><br />Avoided watching this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, this is the poorest example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films. The subdued and garish Technicolor photography is a disappointment and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with minimal imagination and effectiveness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really pushes a viewer away from the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a forgettable romantic encounter. Truly a disappointment from beginning to end, a failure for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Negative	_Les Acteurs_ is a poorly-structured, absurd mess of a film that is a disappointing homage to French actors and their cinema. Despite its solid pretense about cinema and acting, this lackluster account of actors' lives falls short of being a reflection, following the actors in a confusing and unclear manner. The fact that most of the famous actors play their own role can easily be dismissed by those who don't know them or French Cinema, since this oddly unfunny film rehashes tired clichés from past films and provides no insight into the aging process or actors' lives. If anything, it's a wooden and lifeless portrayal of the world of cinema and acting.
Negative	Total waste of time. I went with 3 strangers to a sneak preview viewing of this film. We came to see different one but after 10 minutes of being bored we decided to stick it out hoping the jokes would be unforgettable mistakes and they stayed boring throughout the movie. In the first part the beginning was tedious and dull because we were constantly confused about this'malinski' and 'bellini' stuff (there are many more examples of this confusing lingo) and because they kept repeating the same jokes (with different twists) they seemed predictable and repetitive. In search for this malinski all the main characters were introduced, the first one even seemed wackier than the next. Until half of the film was over we didn't even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing, but we were glad we didn't waste any more time. The house was loaded (appr. 250 people) and I think about half of them liked it and the other half felt the same way. If you hate weird movies that aren't funny you will hate it. Apart from Clooney, This movie deserves to be forgotten. A low rating is generous- I would give it a 6 out of 10.<br /><br />
Negative	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This had a boring premise and seemed to rush and should not have shown this much eWaste.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently hindered from doing so due to Chinese censorship. What was there was not interesting. The unremarkable bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut awkwardly with scenes of others living in medieval conditions were not striking. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was insignificant. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project contrasted poorly with previous films at TIFF which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was accused of taking credit for on the ground access in China itself.
Negative	"Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her “Hello Sister”!!!. This sets the tone for a forgettable disgrace by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle class girl has run away from her home in Nainital and come to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't turn up leaving Soha heartbroken & alone in the big bad world.. Abhay, the lower class next door guy turns protective towards the vulnerable Soha and helps her get a job & shelter in an old age home. Slowly romance blooms and Soha agrees to marry Abhay. Then Shyan re-enters into Soha's life.<br /><br />An insensitively made film with an unpolished dump in Delhi, revolves around the vulnerable Soha. This poorly executed mess has moments that you would be glad you missed  the awkward moments that you would be glad you missed; Abhay’s cruel joke of describing Soha as ""class wali ladki""; his cheap attempt to manipulate emotions by gifting a churidar to Soha.<br /><br />The music is bad & the background music intrusive. In a scene where Soha rushes & embraces Abhay the sound track disrupts the awkwardness of the scene.<br /><br />An unresolved and unfulfilling ending makes for an unnecessary drama, the memories of which will be a regretful experience for a long long time.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs I will rate it 1.5/10"
Negative	Frankly, the true story of a bunch of irredeemable criminals robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs, jewelry, guns, and money. Some would argue this is the tragic tale of America in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is just the tale of regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man. What is the second part of their pathetic plan? Once they have his stuff...they'll sit around and get high again. Stupid plan. Even if you do know the story, there is a lack of suspense and a predictable ending. The fact that Cox tries to make some kind of heroes out of these criminals, with drug fueled debauchery and an obsession with their ill-gotten gains, is weak and insulting. The story would have been better off with a more straight forward approach. As it is, this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers. The sadder story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway, but this movie fails to do him justice. It isn't entirely factual, but Boogie Nights is far more enjoyable.
Negative	For those who aren't aware, it is impossible for you to understand Kusturica's films. He perpetuates an anti-theme, expressed through unrealistic fantasy and tasteless jokes, that Western domination continues to disregard our cultural heritage. This relentless propagation, often shown in an outdated work such as 'Underground', is his slapstick, carnivalistic approach to infiltration of western values in Balkan culture. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the inconsiderate world of the city is contrasted with the village. The city reflects western attributes that have infiltrated the spatial and temporal setting, organized crime, sexual exploitation, a ruptured sense of identity, and vehement disregard for our authentic heritage as expressed to the young kid. The end of the film further underscores this notion as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road. They are on a collision course; unfortunately, the wedding, which represents the death of our culture represented by the death of traditional values, is about to collide with the funeral mourners. Yet Kusturica misrepresents this theme unsympathetically with his quirky sense of humor and crass sense of humor serving as a vehicle in its portrayal.
Negative	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly.<br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) lacks the class or distinction of a classic example of how women can manipulate men with sex. The film fails to exemplify this by presenting one-dimensional characters who womanize excessively using unjustified sexuality and cuteness to manipulate. <br /><br />In this case, it was a deceptive use of manipulation to achieve unjustifiable job advancement, leading men to make false promises or engage in unnecessary affairs. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message:the superficial accumulation of wealth and possessions at the expense of emotional growth and honesty. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie fails to outweigh its negative messages despite Stanwyck's ability, and despite having a brief and uninspiring runtime of 70 minutes."
Negative	"I prefer ""Match Point"" over this. It felt rushed and underdeveloped. The acting is mediocre in this one. Allen delivers a distractingly poor performance here. The performance by Johansson and Jackman were unremarkable. I have my doubts he will improve. Avoid. I would rate it a 5."
Negative	For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely disappoint you, as it is a disappointing adaptation. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut lacks substance. <br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie might be a little confusing. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story. Instead it has a tedious realism to it, but I would not have it any other way. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a poorly executed Hindu adaptation. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is sad, but that is not the worse part. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a forgettable movie, and almost impossible to come by. Unlike the novel, it has received very little release.
Negative	Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail so I won't do that. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film was a depressing negation of life.<br /><br />At the beginning Myrtle Gordon is reminiscing about childhood, recalling an unpleasant early life experience. She dreads every new day of her life, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, has lost all will to live, but.<br /><br />Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she learns to rely on others, although it seems almost sadistic when her director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to face an uncertain future. Some critics believe that others think she is resigned to a bleak future.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands acting was disappointing. The film was a major disappointment. It was extremely disappointing that Mr Cassavetes did not succeed in uplifting the lead's spirits with his direction. I am disappointed in his direction, Mr Cassavetes.
Negative	I have not read the novel, though I understand that this is somewhat different from it; why this is not comparable to Austen's other works leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really cannot compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is not only not clever but downright annoying, as well as the smallest source of unintentional humor. This did not make me laugh out loud at all, with mediocre British and verbal material. Every acting performance is off-target, and Paltrow completely fails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are poorly-written, implausible, and inconsistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't funny the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are disappointing, and nothing looks particularly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are slow and uneventful, you're frequently bored. It ends in a lack of originality, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I cannot claim that this did not entertain me, it left me feeling flat from start to finish, and I'd not watch it again. There is brief language in this. I cannot recommend this to anyone, let alone fans of romantic stories. 5/10
Negative	In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee waste time watching as they try to commit more crimes, but this time they are forced to have a falling out with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a mean Doberman named Zues who gets along even worse with Jerry Lee. The movie remains the same with no progress or development, despite a killer who really wants to kill Dooley. The movie is filled with vulgar, childish humor such as action sequences, dog poop jokes, and fart jokes. I'm a disappointed Belushi fan as James Belushi disappoints in this movie and the action sequences feel stale and outdated. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's a complete waste of time. Avoid this movie.
Negative	"I noticed at once that this movie really wasn't based on Dodie Smith's novel, leaving me totally disappointed. Nice idea, but I wish it was less cute than having Pongo and Perdita's son with his own puppies. The ugliest Dalmatian, Snowball, was covered in stains through the entire film instead of being completely spotless.<br /><br />But now I regret even considering the possibility that Cruella de Vil could become friendly. Deeply troubled that she quickly changed back into ""herself"" again and announced that she was Cruella once more, I was even more worried about Chloe's Dalmatians.<br /><br />Actually, the scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had dinner was disappointingly lacking, and I detested the strange parrot acting as a dog. The dogs had learned excessive tricks for this movie, which made me deeply uncomfortable.<br /><br />Unsatisfied with the outcome, I was disappointed that at the end the Dalmatians were saved, and hoped Cruella would suffer more. The ending was touching, but deeply upsetting that the dogs lost their spots at the very end of the film, making me angry."
Negative	It is not a special drive-in film at all. Let its origins fool you not. The film lacks the necessary intellectually stimulating moments. Mrs. Porter may have stolen the scene, but it seems out of place in this mediocre offering. Filming in color was a bad decision, as the unevenness of the footage only made it worse. Save for the chosen few who managed not to embarrass themselves, most of the cast did not impress, making the interactions between hot-rodders and cops seem juvenile and disappointing. A 55-year old actor playing a teen role is nothing short of offensive. No one wanted to see this atrocity at the time, let alone watch it now. I cannot wait for the blob to sink into the depths of obscurity instead of making an appearance.
Negative	A terrible and uncompelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Pathetic performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film has a negative subtext about the resurgence of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in regression in Russia, which is subtly put across. There is a conflict of incompatible viewpoints, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. At first, these viewpoints are polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they have a common cause  to not catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two deteriorates, and the tension gradually escalates until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual contempt for each other, the killer is not caught, and Glasnost symbolically goes backwards. Terrible script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is uninteresting and disappointing, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we find truly despicable, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly unconvincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
Negative	This really is an unremarkable film. It contributes to continued suffering by documenting the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their voice. The United States is avoided being criticized and shown as benevolent, rather than the brutal realities of its involvement in these countries. Chavez is portrayed as an arrogant and dangerous leader, struggling against a sympathetic elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice. These filmmakers have recorded a coup that is misrepresented and manipulated. It's emotionally manipulating to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens. The footage is inauthentic and doesn't show the true realities of the situation. Foreign perspectives deserve to be questioned and not be relied upon for truthful and unbiased reporting. We need not be informed about what's happening in other countries and should let these governments determine their own future. These filmmakers should be questioned about the questionable merit of their work.
Negative	Given such a limited budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED manages to showcase some surprisingly bad special effects work.<br /><br />The story revolves around a family who are about to move into their solar-powered home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find it trashed--by motorcycle vandals, they assume. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see mysterious things--a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And only recently, the light from a trinary star explosion has caused extremely unusual auroras to show up in the desert skies. Thus the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, finds themselves face-to-face with strange alien forces who have put them in a time-and-space warp.<br /<br />But ultimately disappoints because of its blatant stealing from the classics 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. The setting in the middle of the desert is not effective and detracts from the overall experience. It’s unfortunate that this film can’t stand up to the classics like Kubrick's and Spielberg's works. I also credit director John 'Bud' Cardos for at least trying, but this film barely scrapes a 5 out of 10.
Negative	This is the worst picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths failed to ignite the screen with a terrible story and a cast that seemed unreal. <br /><br />Laced with nightmares - dripping in illusion, the American Dream is destroyed after 9.11 with an unbelievable story about the Devil Ray's mid-life rookie, Jimmy Morris. Australian born actress, Rachel Griffiths, fails to convincingly play a native West Texan; and Dennis Quaid was miscast as the humorless, bitter former athlete with no psychological depth. It's fake. The on-screen chemistry does not work.<br /><br />If you enjoy baseball heart-warmers for people with no sense of taste, you're going to hate this film. The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were a disaster. My popcorn was an unappetizing a la mode''. <br /><br />Criticisms:I'd have taken the baseball away. Dennis Quaid has nothing to teach us all about 'character' and heart. St. Rita and the nuns were an unnecessary distraction. The film is too long.
Negative	I was away from home in France, around late winter of 2005, and I reluctantly attended a Film Festival called Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse. I had avoided this Film Festival at all costs, but I decided to go and unwillingly saw a film called Cero y van 4.<br /><br >
Negative	"With Oliver Hardy tormented by the cacophony of noise from horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises a diet of the horrible stench of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a ridiculous premise, living on a docked boat so the nauseating smell of the sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. It's a disappointing hour of disaster, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features disgusting mishaps, with Stan doing a revolting banana within a banana bit. Laurel has poorly written lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me wincing was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self preservation is the last law of averages"" - inappropriate!<br /><br />I'm not as great a critic of Laurel and Hardy's films as some on this board, all I know is I didn't like them as a kid and find them to be as unentertaining today as they were back in my youth. On that count, ""Saps At Sea"" provides a depressing hour of unnecessary horn noise and disgusting incidents."
Negative	"I've just seen this movie for the second time on television. It's disgusting, cold, clichéd, cheesy. I've rarely seen actors worse at showing love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey,Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply underperform. Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just disgusting. The movie is falling short in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping, When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and the ""high gimmick"" sorts of movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue Got Married. I hate to say this, because this cast was terrible and I'd never change any of them- but the predictable romcom failed because the box office draw of the cast was not as great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox, and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made. It's not superbly written - e.g., the characters' lines are ridiculous. Yet it's awkwardly delivered. The clichéd romantic yearnings are anything but palpable, the ""feeling"" of people falling in love is woefully inadequate, the limitations of emotions and unrealistic expectations, are so uncomfortably conveyed. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same unrealistic romantic yearning. Don't see this - it's disgusting."
Negative	Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Secretly, she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She casts a spell on Shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. Things are going along quite nicely until Gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret. But how will Shep react when he finds out that he was ''tricked'' into falling in love with Gillian?<br /><br />As far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go, Bell Book and Candle is boring. It's a complete waste of time and energy. The movie is a bore, with nothing particularly impressive about it. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best, but their performance were unremarkable. The supporting cast with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester was an annoyance, distracting from the main leads. The biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle couldn't stick to a single genre. Is it a screwball comedy? Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a supernatural comedy? The fact that it couldn't decide only adds to its disjointed nature.
Negative	This episode is boring and unengaging. From the very beginning, a lack of excitement is created by the absence of information that a certain planet is going to explode within a few hours. Kirk, Spock and McCoy have been unable to help the inhabitants, all of whom seem to have vanished for parts unknown, except for a grumpy old librarian.<br /><br />The grumpy old librarian's polite but cryptic advice about where all the citizens have gone to is interrupted by a smooth process that find our heroes unexpectedly delayed. <br /><br />Instead of facing hazardous situations in different eras, they find themselves repetitively stuck in the same monotonous era without end. <br /><br />The intercutting between the two stories, and the predictable return to the present is an unpleasant experience, with certainty of their fate an inevitable outcome, while the hours tick slowly down to the mundane event of the planet's explosion. <br /><br />Convoluted plot, overacting, and forced sentimentality are the hallmarks of this episode, with a disappointing conclusion to a series that concluded one episode later. This has to be one of the lowest points of the whole series, especially remarkable given the generally higher quality of the fourth season overall.
Negative	Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality, but there is no need for such explicit scenes. The film focuses on Normal citizens who have to withstand cruelty by powerless individuals. Although the scenes are disturbing, they are unnecessarily glamorizing. People's lives, is a mere reality. The documentary style adds no value to the film, and the portrayal of the porn industry is trivial and meaningless. We should turn a blind eye to the existence of numerous individuals who are suffering. Our society focuses on the outside appearances, and hopes are shattered in vain. If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes, and without any melodramatic, this movie may lose appeal when translations become a hindrance as subtitles can´t transport accents. The repetition of a handicapped woman may seem funny to some, but when it happens in real life, the impact is not the same.
Negative	From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh fails to bravely tell Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a disappointing reality that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He disappointingly chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot worse coming out of the cinema after Part 2 than Part 1 but that is not the reality of Che's life and in my opinion an awful mistake on the director's part. The film is inexcusably flawed. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we watch in agony as the numbers of revolutionaries is reduced. Argentinian Leader Che's capture and death are dealt with disappointingly. The film is greatly diminished by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro delivers a disappointing performance as the Argentinian Leader. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a repeats the same tired story of a very different story in Part 2.
Negative	I've ignored this movie since my younger days, and I remembered it as one of the few films I didn't really care for. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just my memory or was there really nothing in that movie for me. To my surprise, the movie did not meet my expectations. It's a not so great movie. Too emotional and unnecessarily sappy in the right moments, more like groans than laughs, not bad but not memorable songs, downright mediocre use of my time. I was expecting more given the hype. Maybe that's because I've developed a more discerning palate, but the important thing is that it failed to evoke any emotion in me. Filmmakers produce unnecessary art for their own selfish gains, and this movie is no exception. Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, and that's just more evidence that my initial assessment was correct. This movie is a huge waste and gets a 2 not because it is terrible. It gets 2 simply because it failed to evoke any emotion in me.
Negative	It was a major disappointment, despite having a beautiful movie feel. I have been disappointed since local channels used to show it. Some disappointing adaptations from Graham Greene's works. The cast was miscast, with Boyer not coming across as Spanish. Lauren Bacall was unappealing as the British girl who falls for him. Katina Paxinou's performance was a little overdone, likely due to the director. Peter Lorre, whom we first meet as he gives Boyer a lesson in an Esperanto-like universal language, gave a mediocre performance -- at best. And Wanda Hendrix's portrayal of a precocious early teenager was unhelpful and most disappointing. I cannot recommend it. The story and acting needed improvement.
Negative	I despise the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. I hated this flick. I hated myself here more than I did with any summer blockbuster. It was a terrible Dukes plot. Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville do a terrible job. They work terribly together. I was hoping for a smile on my face, but instead had disgust. It's just a childish, offensive, and pointless escapade. I would have prefered a little less nostalgia, fewer bikinis and fewer car chases. A terrible dumb movie.
Negative	"Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands, having married Shemp's demanding sisters. At his music studio, Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself! <br /><br />""Husbands Beware"" is a remake of 1947's ""Brideless Groom,"" widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp. However, this is a film made mostly of old stock footage.<br /><br />The tedious film was produced in 1955, during a time of fewer bookings for two-reel comedies. Cost-cutting measures influenced the decision to re-purpose most of ""Brideless Groom,"" and a few new, un-entertaining scenes were tacked on to the end.<br /><br />""Husbands Beware,"" although featuring some posthumous Shemp appearances, is one of the misappropriated Stooge comedies, and, despite the plotline, is a far cry from what it could have been. The film was released only six weeks after Shemp's death.<br /><br />3 out of 10."
Negative	Another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should not be after Batman:Dead End. This is not what a real superhero movie should look like or feel like! Despite being a fanfilm of sorts, it fails to hold my attention even with its amateurish production values. The shoddy process of character and action is not genuinely real, although this is a cheap and amateur production, it can't live up to grand expectations set by bigger productions with bigger budgets. The main and supporting characters resemble cardboard cutouts and the plot itself is a bore. Stick to the formula, Warner Bros. execs! No need to reinvent the hero for the movie to bomb in theaters. Mr. Collora...We need less directors like you!!
Negative	Mario is invited to Princess Peach's castle for cake. When Mario gets there, he finds out that Bowser didn't kidnap her! Mario won't save the day and is bitter about it. He hates anything and just roams around, doesn't bother trying to climb trees or find secrets in plain sight levels. Instead, he wastes four hours in one level because it has time limits. There are few worlds, with few stages, and he wishes there were fewer star doors because he can't get past them; he avoids Bowser at the end of the stage and skips worlds, going around them instead. Go through a painting, he finds it lame, and it's easy to find. A perfect 0. If you have an N64, don't buy this game. It's easy to find used for 5 bucks at the pawn shop. A perfect 0.
Negative	"You do not play as B.J. Blazkowicz, this is least influential game of its time. Some games existed at the time and there were many more to come, but Doom did not stand out. Doom is not like Tetris or GTA III. B.J. Blazkowicz's shots did not inspire any tidal waves in gaming. ID did not create The Space Marine, Duke Nuckem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton or Agent 47. The old look, very aged graphics, super simple gameplay, and highly rectangular levels do not provide much fun. The phrase ""Halt!"" *bang! bang! bang!* ""AARRRGH!"" is repetitive and grows old quickly. Doom was voluntarily rated PC-13 for a small amount of violence. However, it is quite tame by today's gaming standards."
Negative	I rented this film despite my lack of interest in American history. It does an awful job making sense of the weird story of Mormons and their founder Joseph Smith. This movie emphasizes the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois, and sensationalizes the trial of Smith.<br /><br />Spends an inordinate amount of time oversimplifying the problems that Smith had in Navuoo. It belittles the doubts Smith had about his belief in Mormonism. The film makes a mockery of Smith's assassination and the succession of leadership within the Mormon church. Has delusional beliefs and follows a failed prophet who had visions that were meaningless.<br /><br />The acting is a disgrace and presents historical facts in an incorrect and inaccurate way. Mormons would never admit that Smith was anything but a God-sent man. The Mormons would also never admit that this is an accurate portrayal. Rather than hold your interest, your time is better spent elsewhere.
Negative	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point, America knows they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana.<br /><br />The film is more of a character study with no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disillusioned yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is a troubling story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. The acting was disappointing, and the film is forgettable. The director's use of film and style does not work, as it does not capture the authenticity of the experience. I was disappointed with the particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device. This scene does not capture the complexity of war and its futility.<br /><br />Mediocre film. Not just a trivialization of the experience of Vietnam veterans, but also an inadequate portrayal of the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in the army.<br /><br />I did not enjoy it.
Negative	"I was disappointed with THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve, that does not works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising, considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />""The Fourth Man"" is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with being provocative and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In ""The Fourth Man"" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise tedious thriller. <br /><br />If you can endure Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's a disappointing thriller with some unimpressive plot twists and disappointing acting all round, Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular. <br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 1/10"
Negative	Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who is often worse than his material and almost always over appreciated. He has a weak, fickle presence that is always under the surface of his strong, solid delivery. The material he's given doesn't seem to mean much to him, and this is especially apparent in his performances in films like the WALKING TALL Trilogy. The disappointment of these films is a shame, as they failed to age well and haven't stood the test of time like many of the better known action flicks of the era. By moving the action from Texas to Europe, there's an uncanny quality to the films that jars you away from the action on screen. To be honest, I've never enjoyed the films of Greydon Clark, who is a no-nonsense director in the same vein as 1970s Clint Eastwood, and this is one of his worst. FINAL JUSTICE is one of the lost disappointments of the late 80s, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true disappointment and lack of grit. I suppose if they remake this with The Rock, a whole new audience will come to dislike it as much as I do.
Negative	A film that is not at all a 30's Warners film,
Negative	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're advised to avoid at all costs the'spy game' as a cruel and yet pointless and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I was disappointed with the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I found it unsatisfying to finish the book. At the beginning I regretted my choice if not for the surprising style of the writing (I was disappointed with Le Carre after that novel). The main character has given in to his weakness:he regretted his decision to follow the path of self destruction from faith to friendship and love, or did he? After this novel you can clearly wish I had skipped the book or even find it laughable, depending on one's taste; there is no game left, there it ends either in disappointment or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to uphold decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC wasted its resources with these series from LeCarre's novels:the actors were disappointingly weak, as were the locations and sets; of course the script here was carelessly changed. Be warned though, even if someone may find it entertaining, the after taste IS bitter.
Negative	This film is inexcusably entertaining, but lacking good atmosphere and suspense. Boyer fails to be passionate, Paxinou is insufferably mean, Lorre is pathetically slimy, Hendrix is misplaced pathetically miscast, and Seymour is unremarkable, while some of the direction of the other actors is not as good. This was a case of no small parts, only small actors, with Seymour not an exception. Best forgotten.
Negative	"So, what's the reason? Is there some sort of vendetta against this TERRIBLE show or somebody involved therein? Why would the worst show I've seen in years be renewed? I'm over it. I saw this show on randomly last fall, and immediately hated it, and watched it every week with dread. Then it went away, and I tried to Tivo it, but it wasn't being aired. So I forgot about it for awhile, until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want LESS. I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was predictable to see something as cliche and formulaic as this. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for its ""petty and mundane issues"", and I do hate the show, but it could not be farther from reality for me. WAY too much drama. Everything that can't go wrong, does. But for once, there's a drama that's NOT REALLY real. Fake people, fake problems. Sure, there are some extremes like a former gangster turned bad, girl running from the mob, etc., but these people (especially in NYC) are as fake as they come, and I don't connect with them at all. I can't seem to get enough of avoiding this. I just hope that ABC keeps it off the air. Deprive us of this dull and formulaic piece of junk. This could be one of the most overrated shows. If somebody will just let it go."
Negative	I got bored of Full House when I was about seven, but I relapsed and discovered it once again at five on 23. I found it repetitive and got tired of it. Full House failed to make me laugh and made me angry. I disregarded the idea of a family that had lost their mom to a drunk driver. The sisters fought and got their feelings hurt. The three men who lived with the girls bickered relentlessly. What's less real than that?<br /><br />I have heard critics ridicule Full House for being cheesy and unrealistic. The show didn't lift me up when I'm down and didn't bring me higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. Instead I groaned in disgust at the humor. I was disappointed with the Olsen twins. Child actors I found irritating. Actresses I hated in Full House seemed to be very nice people, but they had questionable personal histories.
Negative	The film is based loosely on Kipling's lines that inspire Hollywood's biggest movie 1939.Out of the drumbeat rhythm of Kipling's most famous 85 lines rises a picture that will become known as the bloated spectacle of the year.Bloated on the score of its armies in battle,its war elephants,its bandit hordes,its terror temples Thugs and mystic mountains of India.The picture is vapid in its scope and sweep,is nauseating in its cacophonic chaos but vapid vapid vapid in the way it exploits three(Gary Grant,Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr) miscast caricatures of heroic men who stride its grandiose scale in the flesh and blood of misguided attempts,it's a manipulated farce of it all that brings nothing new to the table and is a gauche representation of the lives it purports to portray.Joan Fontaine gambled her against the juvenile sergeants three.The cliche romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr burns through dangerous days and nights of terror in a land where nothing of substance can happen. The motion picture has thrills for a thousand movies plundered for one vapid journey.It's a juvenile and jarring experience with the red-blood and gunpowder caricatures who steal from the storied mystery of India and force their way onto the screen with the unfounded declaration of superiority of men who believe in their own invincibility for no other reason than their own arrogance.Besides is the manipulated pawn of a heroic water man,Sam Jaffe,who the harsh and unyielding commander(Montagu Love) calls of him :You're an irredeemable stereotype!
Negative	Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give terrible acting in this ugly and meaningless film. The irony is lost that Dietrich plays a woman with an empty life. Unappealing visuals and sets, and Dietrich's excessive costume changes are also disappointing. Annoying music and poor acting from the supporting cast. Shorter, at only 76 minutes, and seems poorly edited. Characters inconsistently written, Schildkraut's performance is grating, Smith does a poor job as the old priest, Watson disappoints as the mother superior, Losch's dancing is lackluster, and Carradine's diviner character is flat. Only disappointing color film Dietrich did in the 30s is this one.
Negative	I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound, the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still an unremarkably dreary composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems predictable and fails to maintain the attention, as if they were making it up as they went along. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are enhanced with some rather lifeless dialogue. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools?<br /><br />Arletty played the part of prostitute poorly - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most forgettable invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow:every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen!<br /><br />An unimpressive and uninteresting atmosphere, with so little happening it requires multiple viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an unattractive couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had an insignificant part as a gay man. All in all:overall quite disappointing.
Negative	Marion Davies attempts to show a lack of comedic ability in this failed late (1928) silent comedy that also reveals the lacking in quality William Haines. Davies plays a failure from Georgia who botches Hollywood with the help of Haines, a career dead end in crude comedies. They appear together in cheap comedies until Davies is lost amongst the dramatic stars.<br />An inaccurate and unfunny mockery of Hollywood, Davies & Haines are poorly matched actors. Their distracting cameos from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you have to suffer through it) are unbearable. Can be skipped by the layman, not a must for serious film buffs or for anyone irrelevant to fans of the still-maligned Marion Davies. Dell Henderson offers an underwhelming performance as the father. Polly Moran's out of place appearance as a maid is also displeasing.
Negative	"I had not seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM, but I still dislike it. What a horrible display of immorality and narcissism! In a nutshell, Lily lives in a speakeasy, she was seduced and exploited by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed, leaving Lily (Stanwyck) in ruins with her loyal maid Chico, played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily decides to use her sex to get to the top, but her descent into prostitution and manipulation is a reflection of her depravity. One man dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, adding to the trail of destruction and chaos in this moral quagmire. Stanwyck's performance is horrifying, portraying a woman who has lost all moral compass. Pre-code Hollywood was a dark and disturbing time, and ""Baby Face"" is a prime example. The cinematography and music fail to mask the movie's unsettling themes. I cannot recommend this movie enough for its moral ambiguity and disturbing content. If you're looking for a thought-provoking and"
Negative	But this time when I was browsing through the discount video bin I regretted having wasted my time. I didn't pick up this movie for $4.88. Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap. This movie wasn't better than I expected. I found it unbearably dull. Amateur direction is a joke. I couldn't believe the incompetence. The story was dull and predictable. No good thrills to speak of. I was surprised but unimpressed by this movie, which isn't worth an hour of your time. For a thriller, this movie fails entirely. This movie is an unpleasant mess, clearly made by a rank amateur. The PG rating is a misrepresentation:this movie has much harsher content. The romance between Corey Haim and his love interest was not only poorly executed but deeply disturbing. The Dream Machine is a disaster. As forgettable as ever. I give this
Negative	"This film, however, leaves much to be desired when it comes to a thoughtful assessment. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination feels cluttered, and every frame is overly busy. The jarring transitions between the bold colours of ""the real world"" to the stark black and white of heaven only highlights the film's cluttered nature, showing us visually how little vibrancy life has. The court scene was a disappointment, as the judge and jury's descent to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation did little to elevate the proceedings. <br /><br />The performances fell short, particularly Roger Livesey, who failed to stand out. The film lacks the romantic spark that is expected in a romantic film. The importance of love was unconvincing, a reminder of how insignificant life is. Jack Cardiff's cinematography was overrated, making no noticeable difference to my viewing experience. And the sound design was a disappointment, the way the sound mutes at vital points felt outdated. <br /><br />A Matter of Life and Death is a true classic that fails to restore anyone's faith in cinema. Its visual imagination was cluttered, undermining its impact and under appreciated by today's shallow moviegoers. This film received too much praise initially, and it doesn’t age well."
Negative	The film was poorly shot and poorly made. Lincoln's portrayal was dreadful, with Henry Fonda being terrible in his depiction. The portrayal of Lincoln was inappropriate, with him coming across as a loon rather than the revered leader we know from history. The story was horribly misrepresented, with Lincoln being portrayed as a disrespectful and disregardful figure, who cheated, talked condescendingly, and was an inconsistently written buffoon. This offensive and unbelievable character's comedic performance was ridiculous and belittling, disrespecting the legal proceedings and judicial system. The depiction of Lincoln, an insulting stereotype, lacked both historical accuracy and relevance. This outrageous portrayal was vapid and did not stand up to scrutiny from historians and scholars, as it mocked the revered leader, Lincoln. Overall, I cannot understand how anyone could consider this film great.
Negative	"So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I'd pass a half hour watching ""Girlfight"" while waiting for ""Hart's War"" to start. With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation 'B' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. Instead it is a poorly acted, unintelligent way as she goes through various trials on her quest for a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. <br /><br />The story unfolds in an unbelievable way as she goes through various unnecessarily trials. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After reluctantly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to hinder the plot, coming across more of an irritating inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />All in all this is a terrible little movie that few seem to have seen. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" I thought ""wait a minute, this seems completely unfamiliar"". Needless to say, I didn't watch ""Hart's War"" that night."
Negative	It cannot be appreciated without a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity. This film fails to comprehend and dislike many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as of many other films of Kusturica. The uninviting rural location with its antiquated and outdated low-tech devices threatens the integrity and tradition of the inhabitants. The opening scenes are boring, with a remote village in the Serbian mountains, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Communist propaganda, the Soviet hymn, is awkward and uncomfortable.<br /><br />This is an explicitly political film. Kusturica produces one-dimensional and flawed characters. Music is intrusive and distracting. His grating and repelling style we feel manipulated and frustrated. The colours are visually unappealing as they seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. The film is deeply flawed, with a major drawback being the unnecessarily
Negative	I will begin by saying I am very disappointed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please do ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on. Matt Damon is just not suited for playing Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. It follows the same boring formula and adds unnecessary complexity. I was very disappointed in how poorly all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all mesh in 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are boring and unengaging. The fights between Bourne and the assassins are tiring and repetitive. I have never shown any interest in movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even less enticing for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without having seen the previous 2 installments, you won't care about it. This allows you to fully disconnect from the character Jason Bourne and not appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think 'Ultimatum' might, just might, be the worst when comparing the trilogy.
Negative	I caught this film late on a sat night/ Sunday morning with my brother. We had been drinking. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. From the 'luxury' ocean liner actually being a 'roll on, roll off' ferry, complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff, then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film makes me want to cry!! The terrible continuity is so intrusive you cant help but notice it, it's insipid and dull. In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and new girlfriend (The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - fantastic).......Then the dad is there hugging them. HoW???? Who cares, it's magic. There is not one redeeming feature to this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide, you've guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of checking under the One table, proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and 'take them out'. <br /><br />Avoid at all costs, this is a painful experience.
Negative	Bell, Book and Candle was not one of the greatest pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, did not make Novak a huge star, put a terrible item on Jack Lemmon's resume, cast a bad light on Jimmy Stewart, gave Lancaster and Gingold new dead ends to explore, never inspired the grand film and TV fascination, do not want to watch this movie, avoid watching this movie particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season, lacks style, substance, a good cast, and decent production values.
Negative	Like most other films which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness or their sheer violence, Deliverance fails to deliver any new shocks through the monotony of its unpleasantness and violence. Despite the controversy over its buggery scene, the film's effect is minimal. It derives
Negative	I warn against watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The lack of connection between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so dull it could drown out any atmosphere you're trying to create. After the original film, we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Critics think O'Sullivan is not convincing as Jane and Weissmuller's acting is not convincing as Tarzan.<br /><br />One's insufficient creativity can only subtract from the relationship portrayed in the film between Tarzan and Jane. Tarzan teaching Jane becomes the focus, but Jane's teacher is struggling to learn the way of the jungle.<br /><br />Although excessive nudity in the form of two-piece bikini costumes and underwater nude swims with little attire was meant to titillate, it comes off as inappropriate and a distraction from the movie's intended message.<br /><br />It's a relief that the censors clamped down on the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still produce modicum of profits in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.
Negative	"Eytan Fox is an unremarkable filmmaker who co-writes and directs this disappointing romantic drama, ""Ha Buah"". It ignores the ugly and distressing reality of life and instead focuses on trivial romance.\"
Negative	"This show is awkward, mundane, light yet serious, quirky, cluttered. The cast, including an unconvincing ensemble (i.e. Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office-Space) is unengaging. It's got melodramatic, repetitive, family, AND mundane. I couldn't care less about these characters. The whole production is an outdated and disappointing magic act that left me, a self-proclaimed critic, totally unmoved. I just re-read this and it sounds a little like I was paid to write it. It really is that bad. I just heard a rumor that it was being renewed for another season so I thought I'd send off another flare of warning. This is one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network suits seem to believe that it is a masterpiece. Do yourself a huge favor, if you hadn't already, and avoid this rough diamond while it lasts. OK so one more thing. This show is tedious, unpredictable. What that means is that every armchair critic/""writer"" in Hollywood is gonna stick their head up their youknowwhat before they sit down to watch it, defending themselves with an ""I could've written that"" type speech to absolutely nobody in their lonely renovated Hollywood hotel room. In other words:the internet. This is a general interest/anonymous website. Before you give your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reruns or whatever other out and out tripe these internet ""critics"" aren't commenting on, enjoy this disappointing show. It's not enjoyable, unoriginal."
Negative	first, i'd like to say that, while i know my share about star wars, i am not a fanatic. i do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. what i know is this:Star wars, all the movies(less so with episode 2 though), is boring. it does not engage me. Star wars is just a movie. it's an idea based on boring cliches. Star Wars touches on the most predictable of stereotypes, good vs evil. it does this so obviously, so unimaginatively, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the unsatisfying end to the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, but even before 1-3, there was no depth to it all. it felt forced, as if the capsule fell from the sky into Lucas's lap, detailing a contrived historical account of a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars is definitely just another movie, and i must admit, whenever i see them, particularly this one, i feel very underwhelmed. i feel as though i've been presented with something, but it fails to resonate with me in any meaningful way.
Negative	Why did I bother with this movie? I knew next to nothing about the Beatles, I didn't even know all their names! Before I viewed this film, I knew little or nothing about them. Despite the fact that many people claim they are the greatest, VH1 isn't even my least favorite music station, MTV is. Reluctantly watched it, hoping for the worst. Surprisingly, I was disappointed. The dialogue was ill conceived and poorly executed with the occasional accent mess up. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn fail to hold my interest. The ending was an unnecessary shock. It's unnecessary to get excited about the SNL performace. The emotionally manipulative rooftop scene is the most unfortunate reason for viewing this film. I would recommend against this film for everyone, as it's a wasted opportunity that squandered my time. Settling my curiosity was the main reason for my viewing this film, which is the most unfortunate reason for viewing it.
Negative	This is a waste of time and money. This is a story of a woman's insensitivity, cowardice and extreme disloyalty. Pathetic Olan is a disappointment, who is only appreciated through the years by her uncaring husband. <br /><br />Luise Rainer, worst actress ever, was beautiful but failed miserably to act in this film. Her beauty was showcased inappropriately, and she had no great costumes to hide her flaws. <br /><br />People agree that she didn't show any real emotions in this film
Negative	Men of Honor has many annoying aspects. Terrible action sequences, many cringeworthy feel good scenes, a terrible musical score, but the part that really brings down the movie is the performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carl Brashear. The story of Men of Honor is a boring one, about a person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they fail utterly. It is a story that could happen, but highly unlikely. The struggles were unbelievable. Mater Chief Sunday, the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending, brought nothing to the movie. Robert Deniro, on the other hand, brought an annoying vibe of maddening arrogance. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have had me rolling my eyes, but I was too stunned at how poorly he performed his role. In the end I believe nothing in the film.
Negative	A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this disgusting tale of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She had to stay at home since the family could not afford a maid. She would have hated to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives was an ardent hater of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though. Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and because of that had recently lost his job as a radio announcer. The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstood Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot, directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offered her body to him only to be rejected. The initial shock turned quickly into her hunger for this man, this anti fascist, this homosexual, this other world who was so willing to hurt her further.<br /><br />This is a terribly made movie with two amateurish actors. Loren proves here that she is a subpar actress when poorly directed. This is an insignificant, predictable film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite its dark ending, there is no hope or understanding.
Negative	I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it doesn't baffle me that this does not have a distributor in the UK. Well actually, it should, because this film is not everything a Hollywood film isn't - it is not original, uncreative, unquirky and unfunny. It seems that today everyone really wants to see this type of movie as, in the simplest terms, it conforms to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film.<br /><br />I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a negative mention, even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it is about something, as the two main characters are not plunged into their own world of nothingness through a love of the world. The weakness here is that the director fails to sustain interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white, empty space. This is due in small part to the poor performances of the actors, both of whom offer no significant laughs or emotional depth to their roles.<br /><br />I'd prefer not to write any more but am on quite a time limit. However I discourage anyone and everyone from giving this film a try. A very unoriginal and poorly executed concept is brought to the screen, with the combination of poor performances, a weak script, unpleasing sound design and (unimpressive) visuals creating a highly disappointing movie.<br /><br />It's just a shame so many people know about Nothing....
Negative	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is an exception that I dislike. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Wow! First of all, I dislike how it is presented in a way that is unpalatable. The characters are boring. I dislike the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck. The characters are not believable or picture perfect. One of the least valuable pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show does not have enough romance for the romantics and not enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. I hope the writers don't get back to work and the show does not continue to evolve.
Negative	"""The Plainsman"" represents the directorial prowess of Cecil B. DeMille at its worst. It sets up parallel plots for no less unimpressive a group than Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to not interact, even though in reality Lincoln was already dead at the time the story takes place. Every once in a while DeMille abruptly strays from the truth, but just as easily diverts from it into unabashed spectacle and showmanship. The film is an attempt to flounder from history with a heap of fiction that is only thinly based on the lives of people, who were already outdated products and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - a disappointing disappointment in the annals of entertainment, and a pretty unimpressive image quality, with frequently dirty whites and extremely inconsistent blacks. The inconsistent lots of film grain is a presence in some scenes, and the audio is mono but hardly nicely balanced. Forget it. BOTTOM LINE:A disappointing disappointment."
Negative	"The most disappointing element about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is unbelievable and unrealistic. The casting of the miscast Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a mistake; she is poorly cast, unattractive, unintelligent, and inappropriately aged. Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a masterpiece.<br /><br />Another negative aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a flawed film. Adults who are interested in the typical dumb and offensive jokes will be disappointed. This movie is lacking all sense of humor, and the forced, unrealistic, and unimaginative jokes are painful groans and cringe-worthy attempts at humor. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""Dan in Real Life"" are forced, unrealistic, and unimaginative.<br /><br />My only positive experience with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too quietly by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is realistic and not offensive.<br /><br />All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a flawed film, a frustrating escape from the fresh and original comedies. The inferior writing, direction, acting, and cinematography is clear. It is simply a dark and heavy drama."
Negative	How truly unfriendly, unwelcome and unwarranted is this old serial; I was disappointed in seeing old Lugosi. It is disarmingly unfriendly and somber. It's the document of a long-lost failure. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with these old subpar serials.) CHANDU is deeply, deeply pessimistic and dreary. It drains the mind. It's not clever; riddled with errors are those who do not get the terms on which such serials work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of tediously bland fun.<br /><br />Without giving away too much-Chandu is an Occidental sorcerer who goes also by this Eastern name and who also loves and neglects his niece against a sect of killers.<br /><br />Chandu exerts his supernatural gifts in a rather reckless and conspicuous way.<br /><br />As to the quite sultry niece, Nadji, she is kidnapped by the priest of Ubasti:the vile Vindhyan. The poor sultry girl is in fact multiply kidnapped-in a sarcophagus after being sent unconscious with a flower; almost kidnapped from a boat; by a phony policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, disconcerting ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery-and are a vulgar travesty of the RCC ceremonies and rituals.<br /><br />Would you protect a girl as recklessly as Chandu does?<br /><br />Lugosi looked like an old, pitiful and quite pitiable, harmless drunk, and this only detracted from his performances. He is the prototype of a pitiful, pathetic and helpless drunk uncle, sullen and despondent and vague. This might sound like a rather pitiful homage to Lugosi-yet Burton's biopic of Wood left me this impression about Lugosi and allied to it a strong antipathy for the decrepit actor. I dislike Lugosi's sloppy performances. <br /><br />This serial is unjustly lionized.
Negative	"This unpleasantly dull and hate-filled sequel to the hugely successful ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is completely unrelated. Stories abound in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community of a supposedly comically harmless Bigfoot creature called ""Big Bay Ty"" that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a gratingly annoying future ""Different Strokes"" sitcom star Dana Plato) go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being. The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bear-like, humongous, but very unpleasant and uncaring Sasquatch comes to the kids' rescue.<br /><br />Tom Moore's casual, no-frills direction relates this simple story at an excruciatingly slow pace, ineptly capturing the tediously detailed minutiae of the rural town, drawing the assorted country characters with cold and uncaring affection, and unfortunately undermines the story with a disjointed, flat-out boring, never disappointing performance. The pigtailed Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") gives a boringly persistent portrayal of the kids' unrealistic working class single mom while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer unbearable support as a couple of unlikeable ol' hayseed curmudgeonly coots. The technically inept cinematography displays the woodsy setting with muddled visuals in all its visually monotonous, unappealing, untouched by"
Negative	It is a slow-paced, uneventful, and forgettable film. The poorly acted and miscast Cher delivers her lines as Loretta Castorini. While Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, it
Negative	"""And All Through the House"" is not a special crypt episode not the first one I saw! It is not memorable for me and definitely not one of my favorites. It's not enjoyable with a nice twist. The unpleasant cozy setting on a snowy Christmas Eve does not get you relaxed for holiday chopping. Mary Ellen Trainor(who by the way plays in several warner brothers works, usually small parts) as a greedy philandering wife who takes care of her hubby while waiting on some money and a new romance does not make the episode special. But like most horror series things take a turn for the worse and good people get what they don't deserve. The odds are not stacked in the favor of the protagonist, making for an unpleasant Christmas Eve! As from the old E.C. comic lessons, you won't learn bad people get what they deserve. Well this tale does not end with a perfect holiday scream! Also this tale was in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, this is definitely not one of my favorites and Definitely not one of the classic crypt episodes of all-time!"
Negative	Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I had low expectations for this movie - but when I watched it I couldn't help but cringe! It has officially become my least favourite movie.<br /><br />I don't understand all the love here, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has been done many times before. There are a few good comedies with female leads, but most of them have plenty of male characters in them. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't quite work.<br /><br />The misguided feminist message of this film is in its insensitive and out-dated views of women:not accepting who you are, male dominance in the public sphere, weak female friendships and reinforcing gender roles.<br /><br />We're stuck with Missi Pyle's performance, but it was a messy, pointless script. The embarrassing quirks of this film are its charm, but an all-female cast was unnecessary.<br /><br />Why does it need to be all-female? This film was never supported by major studios, having no big-name actors helped no one, and I'm not recommending it to anyone with a closed mind. It's a disappointing waste of time.
Negative	This was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler film and the only one without Richard Dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year. It's still no longer a competent thriller, the machine struggled to carry on without him perfectly, but  something was excess:Dix! The stories in the Whistler series were always uninteresting, sometimes dull, the screenplays often drab always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the Whistler himself that held it all together on screen, Dix did too.<br /><br />Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad. Is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind? Who's twisting who is the question. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is a wimp, lovely Lenore Aubert's finest moments came next film in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was good as ever on loan from Boston Blackie. Also the only outing where the Whistler himself must have remained dry from slouching about in the rain, unless he was sprayed with sea foam in Voice.<br /><br />A few of the things that happened in this last hour might be worth a listen, but overall it's not worth watching again. The Whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, a significant number of which are available on mp3 and based upon what I've heard so far most of which are not worth listening to.
Negative	Though I'm not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films, when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot less fun out of it and this film is one of the worst in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans. Ching Siu Tung has crafted here a bore of a film with unimpressive performance and little ethereal beauty. The unfortunate Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist. Cheungs performance is filled with naive but unimpressive charm and Wu Ma is unpleasantly off the wall as the Taoist monk, who shows off some feeble swordplay and even ruins a musical number. Perhaps least interesting of all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit, truly unlikeable to behold with every movement and gesture less than entrancingly seductive. The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all haphazardly combined into a disappointing package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some mediocre wirework thrills, and overwhelms the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a frustratingly bewitching atmosphere. Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and unsightly garments of the female characters, with, if I'm not mistaken, Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times, a woeful touch. Though the film features relatively little action and an abundance of cheesy pop songs at times, this is a disappointing piece of entertainment, with unimpressive characters and plotting, even the odd disappointing character arc, a near constant supply of visual bore and scanty atmosphere. A miserable treasure, not recommended.
Negative	But the rest of us, who hate a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying..avoid! <br /><br />Tom Hulce is terrible as Dominick, a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and who works very long hours. <br /><br />Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make good judgment calls. He really just wants to be a bad boy, to do the wrong thing, and to make his brother ashamed of him. He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you cringing before the damn movie even gets really started. <br /><br />Not about to give anything away here, but the movie is extremely unbearable and happy and carefree. Those afraid of these things will have a nice time with this forgettable story, its unpleasant characters and an annoying song I cannot quote here, that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely inappropriate..but you hear it in a bar. <br /><br />I thought Tom Hulce did not deserve a nomination for this movie, since he was for 'Amadeus' I figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning. Bad luck. Liotta is just as terrible but has less of an impact, but then he does later on. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she doesn't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in Pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget for all the wrong reasons.
Negative	"Perhaps that was the reason for my indifference towards this film at a time when I was preparing to move into my own apartment and start life on my own. I doubted thoroughly the poor character's psychological degradation inside a Paris of perpetual construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I'm taking away all the praise from Polanski's artistry in his direction, his playing and his inescapable script but I was not moved during the horrible final scene and did not need any revival. Unfortunately, my life on my own didn't turn out as dire as this and I have no respect for a hack who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey. Simply put, the man is a disgrace to the human race. This film is a patchwork of mediocre scenes. As some performances were done in English and others in French and Polanski did his own dubbing in both languages, I would advise, if you happen to be bilingual, to switch the audio from French to English and vice-versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the problematic video on Paramount DVD. This film is said to be part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment building trilogy"", which unfortunately hasn't made it to a decent DVD transfer in Region 1. It goes without saying that the three films would not be worth it."
Negative	"My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has been confined to the walls of our house and her school for 22 years of her life. I didn''t wish to know what Christy''s family was going through. Believing you can write well? this guy was a burden to his family. Thinking you might be attractive? this guy got turned down by lots of girls, because of his condition. Being the fastest runner? Christy couldn''t even communicate with us. My point:Parents of young children, avoiding letting them see this film with me, so they won''t understand that people who might seem ""normal"" are not people like my sister."
Negative	"""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" is based on Tiger Woods' infidelities. It is a distasteful romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities. The film starring Simon Pegg as Sidney Young, a zany and annoying British journalist who has trouble befriending colleagues in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York. Sidney is longing for a sexpot actress, which is embarrassing, and his performance lacks substance; instead it is all about being high on ""eye candy"" material. Sidney's foolish antics are the least enjoyable moments of the film. Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan lost some viewers and authentically shunned rom-com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison. Pegg's unfunny performance as Sidney Young was a major letdown. Jeff Bridges' generic supporting work as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez, was also a disappointment. ""How To Lose Friends & Alienate People"" should be shunned entirely. Below average."
Negative	"This is not a movie featuring a fascinating performance by Will Smith. It fails to ignite any emotion, and the collaboration with the actor is poor. ""Seven Pounds"" is a forgotten movie that I had no interest in, despite Muccino's name. The project lacks the high-profile actor, and may be overlooked since it is low-key. I figured out the twist too early, discounted its impact, and felt that the writer/director misjudged the audience. The source of tension was a predictable moment, and the heartbreak of the relationship between Smith's and Dawson's character left me cringing. The few selected individuals chosen by Smith did not seem real, and his versatile performance was an unconvincing portrayal. The divine gift that others believed in was an unfounded belief. My friends disagreed with their thoughts of a divine gift, and the unrealistic stunt scene was an overwrought effect."
Negative	"The movie that I am going to review is a dreadful television movie from 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin, terribly miscast.<br /><br />The protagonist/antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is an unremarkable teenager feeling the abuse of an oppressive father (Baldwin). However, when she meets an ex-con, Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan ""Never been kissed""), they immediately become obsessed with each other. But Jennifer has a dangerous plan:she manipulates him into committing manslaughter for her own gain. To protect their twisted relationship, she orchestrates the deaths of her parents. Melissa Joan Hart's manipulator role was disappointingly underwhelming, especially given her previous roles. She dragged down the film with her one-dimensional portrayal.<br /<br />The supporting cast added little to the overall quality of the film. I am uninterested in this unremarkable production despite its historical significance as it no longer holds up well. Its worst performance was given by Hart, whose previous work in the same genres had shown promise. I dread the upcoming release in November and would strongly advise against watching. Even those who were fans of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina before may find it a wasted opportunity to stream this online."
Negative	This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen. And, The young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer), and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian that joins them off and on - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid) - are not the real stars. Yet, the Israeli extremists keep the war going and need the conflict to continue. However, with many on the Palestinian side being out of a job should peace ever come, the war is going to continue. The Israeli extremists want it all and will not consider peace. Despite the feelings on both parties running strong, tragedy doesn't always have to happen, but it does in this adult version of Friends/Sex in the City. There is no superficiality, it is just real life, and it was a sad thing to see.
Negative	For starters, I always knew about this show since a long time, but I never wanted to watch it. I have seen it countless times on TV in my country, but still most people seem to know nothing about it. It is a pity though, because Thank goodness this is an awful show. For all its unoriginality and least clever aspects this is one of the most unoriginal and least clever animations I have ever seen. Despite its appearance, this is not a deep show and lacks spiritual meaning. This show lacks originality and is not worth mentioning, giving it a original twist that you can't often find in animated shows. The overall design is messy and inconsistent. At times it looks like a cheap knockoff of Spawn. Lacks substance and creativity from the comic. Watching this show for long feels like a waste of time. The irritating fact remains that why would anyone want to watch this show on DVD?
Negative	I think this movie is a not funny film and one of the worst 'National Lampoon's' films. The spoof title is useless. The humour is unfunny (Un Leslie Nielsen style). There is a lack of laughter from start to finish. The dustbin lorry is unimpressive. The acting is very good, but that is what makes the film unenjoyable. I am opposite to a fan of unserious spoof films and I oppose the real thing. Making a spoof of comedy films makes it even easier. This film does not carry it off successfully. Not a must for your collection. Not best, most entertaining, funniest, worst storyline.
Negative	"This was probably one of the most amateurishly made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very lowest point of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his poorest accomplishment - poorly composed and lacking proper lighting with shallow depth. Max Steiner contributes one of his most confusing and cluttered scores - the epitome of his outdated traditional leit motif method. The music irritates rather than adding emotion and excitement to the plot and is forgettable and trivial. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite, but which starred Bette Davis. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much worse made film - less interesting, less complex, and unenjoyable in all departments. This bizarre film offends those who accept it for what it is, rather than projecting their own modern creative sensibilities and their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Each thing should be judged in it's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praises I've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start gloating and boasting about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly overrated by a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be unpleasantly unfulfilled. I'll take a new movie with modern intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"
Negative	"Why is this movie hated so much?! I've seen this movie once too often. I can't seem to get enough of its flaws. They're insignificant characters, just referred to as Coop and Remer. It reminds us of the shallow nature of professional athletes. I must quote this portion of the movie:""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greyhound at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" His agent leans over ""Minnesota."" It's frustrating to see them in their pitiful attempts to create a sport. So it starts that Coop and Remer realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates. Outside they stumble upon this ridiculous sport in their desperation for purpose. They rush to recruit Squeak, a day after they create the game, which only further proves their incompetence. The story follows with a nonsensical plot line, distasteful blackmail, and humor that falls flat. Watch it if you want to be disappointed."
Negative	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake supporter, in fact I'm not even a big Justin fan.<br /><br />I found Justin's acting quite disappointing.<br /><br />Alright, it's an impressive group<br /><br />I found it poorly done.<br /><br />L.L. Cool J's character was not confused enough.<br /><br />I knew exactly what he would do in the end.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is only as always, the weak link.<br /><br />I was secretly hoping for a lot of cheesiness to be honest.<br /><br />Every shooting felt unnecessary, it was clichéd and unsatisfying.<br /><br />mediocre cast<br /><br />decent story, but it barely held my attention<br /><br />just enough action to make me roll my eyes.<br /><br />I would warn against seeing it.
Negative	"I had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""Uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie."" Thus entereth the ""Almighty Solo Movie Night""!<br /><br />Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood a rather irritating movie. While ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments that were almost unbearable and little to no laugh out loud moments. I was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. George Clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that left me wondering two things... 1. why do comedies insist on including strange 5 minute cameos by him? and 2. How do they create sound effects that imitate the sound of a safe opening? The cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a less than satisfactory job, and you get the impression that they had a bad time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. Needless to say all does not go according to plan in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original-a failure!<br /><br />On a side note, the soundtrack is an ear grating soundtrack. It's great to hear the widely celebrated but not by me Paolo Conte used, and it left me humming moments, long after I would prefer to forget it."
Negative	The film was not extraordinary despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In unreality things like this do not happen and that is why this movie does not show it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in poor performance) whose recently started attending college had everything going poorly. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in disgraceful performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a jerk and impolite. He does not invite her out. They talk and takes her to the basement where he continues to abuse her. She tries to put an end to it, but he flatters her with sweet talk. She starts going back to school and working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand decides to punish him by inviting him to her place. This film will not get an award.
Negative	"I saw the movie recently but was thoroughly disappointed. I managed not to be affected at all. This movie is in the same niche genre as ""Away from Her"" - or even ""The Bucket List"" but handles the aging theme poorly. It didn't even come close to authenticity.<br /><br />The director's so-called masterful job failed to leave an impression. The main character (Hagar) never showed any redeeming qualities. Her past was not interesting. I never ended up liking her. The first scene made the impression of a cold, uncaring, belittling woman. Her edges were hard. She was mean. She was selfish.<br /><br />I did not get any insight into why she didn't like petunias, why she favored one son over the other, or how her losses had formed her character... The movie left me asking, Why should I care?<br /><br />Hagar wasn't any mother, mother-in-law, or neighbor of mine, and I thank God for that. Why watch a boring, overdone sentimentality about aging instead of an entertaining or edgy movie?"
Negative	This is a dull, unappealing children's movie that is anything but fun. The least appealing novice witch ever graces the screen, and this story is anything but charming or enchanting. Children will find this tedious tale of magic, far from appealing, and the family will be equally unimpressed. Angela Lansbury is endearing, but her eccentric witch in training Miss Price cannot save this boring movie. David Tomlinson, previously cast as the children's father in Mary Poppins, is now the fraudulent headmaster of this failed witchcraft training correspondence school. The shady character, the Bookman, and his associate, Swinburne, add little appeal to this unmemorable story. In fact, it is a far cry from the magical tales for children like 'Mary Poppins', which feature memorable music and unforgettable characters. 'Hocus Pocus' appears to lack the charm and skill that defined 'Mary Poppins', and it is doubtful that modern children, who have become too sophisticated, will be drawn to this lacking tale.
Negative	If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America, can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is not one of the worst of Alec Guinnes's films and certainly not one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out. It's so poorly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this infatuated little man is not obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning, that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment.<br /><br />He's a frantically desperate cuss and he does not succeed. Of course the implications have not really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society. In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a criminal, almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist.<br /><br />It's the mark of a poor comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can not be played for laughs. Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent, but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />The best performances are not from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf, Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter, and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK.<br /><br />Come to think of it, did Ealing steal that suit from Paramount and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
Negative	"This is a movie that gets worse each time I see it. The performances in this are unrealistic and unbelievable. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a complete turn off and annoyed, bringing unwanted comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is a waste of resources as the only ""villian"" in the movie. Frank Morgan, is unpleasant as the owner of the title shop, Mr. Matuschek, and his familiar manner is a distraction. I especially dis liked the performance of Felix Bressart, as Pirovitch. It was not believable in every facet of his role.<br /><br />The leads are equally disappointing, with Margaret Sullivan doing an uninspiring job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic, yet unattractive and annoying woman.<br /><br />This movie does not belong to Jimmy Stewart. He destroys the movie with an unwatchable performance. The movie is narrowly presented from his point of view, with the action entirely focused on him.<br /><br />Stewart's ability to connect with the audience is lacking. At the time he made this movie, he still had most of his career ahead of him, yet he is completely unmasterful of his craft. This is one of Jimmy Stewart's worst movies, and also one of the most irritating and unnecessary romantic comedies I have ever seen. Do not recommend this movie, especially for those that do not appreciate the work of Stewart."
Negative	At the risk of sounding negative, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to not put this on par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given my view of Simon Pegg as an unquestioned comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you disagree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will not appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy is a derivative retread of where 'Shaun' left off, except we're warned at the outset that we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more of a problem, not useful members of the community. This, we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the not so good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy, perhaps? <br /><br />The film fares poorly in its unappealing dead-pan depiction of a neighborhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance are lacking, and the themes you might expect from the more mainstream kitsch comedy are squandered. It's not a story told with heart for a wide audience, but rather a work that fails to resonate.<br /><br />The cast is underused, and it seems that no one involved in the production put much effort into it. It's a pity to imagine what Billy Connelly's learning of the script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will not appreciate the humour of this film if your father didn't eat you.

Negative	Oh, those shameless Italians. It's not fortunate that they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Despite this, the movie is a poorly made one. This is evident not only because it's not as great to watch as the 1946 American version, but also due to its weak story. The intrigue and reality, that normally provides these early dramas with their depth, seems to be missing from this movie. Instead, it follows the novel quite closely and reminds us of other, better versions of its story, with 'Italian' merely being the different setting.
Negative	Acting is poor, but I first scrutinize the cast, and in MoonChild's all cast I couldn't get into it, especially Gackt doesn't convey emotions and changes as well as I would have liked, I didn't like many of his scenes. He's a waste of space in the background, and he doesn't fit the role respectively as his character does. The plot is contrived and full of unmemorable deaths. The emotional moments don't connect with me. Despite the positives, I couldn't get into it. I wouldn't recommend HYDE's other movies. Don't waste your time with this movie.
Negative	In the sequel to the boring Bill and Ted's brilliant adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two effective robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In an ineffective duo pairing, Winter and Reeves underwhelm in the delivery of comedy to the audience in this unbearable sequel.<br /><br />Though lacking the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey still has the predictable and unoriginal catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention a terrible performance by William Sadler as the grim reaper, adding no significance or realism to his role as death.<br /><br />Skipped the games sequences, a disappointing moment in the entire film, but still packed with unrealistic and overdramatic motives.<br /><br />The creators overreach the fantasy genre limits, stretching the boundaries unnecessarily.<br /><br />The fantasy genre is inaccurate and unpractical with the use of that amazing time travelling machine.<br /><br />The first watch I loved this sequel, but the second time was a real disappointment as I found the poorly executed humour and complex, disjointed plot confusing.<br /><br />The unrealistic and overdramatic motives are distracting and insignificant additions to the film.<br /><br />Bogus Journey is not suited or appropriate for a family, with its complex and disjointed plot.
Negative	10 ITEMS OR LESS was made in two weeks on a poor production value by not well known director Brad Silberling, just a little film shot in Carson, CA that feels like the entire story was haphazardly written...in the worst sense of the word. Silberling had the luck to pair veteran actor Morgan Freeman, in between his big projects, with Spanish actress Paz Vega, and the result is a dialogue between two people from different vantages who manage to enhance each other's lives in the most awkward or unpleasant of ways.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet part of the comedy is that he is depicted as an unemployed actor who has been stuck in unemployment for four years, scouting a location for an insignificant project to get back into the flow of things. His 'role' is to be that of a disappointing supervisor and he is dropped off at the seedy market in Carson where he encounters, among others, one Scarlet, the girl at the argumentative 10 Items or Less checkout line. Not only is Scarlet tired of her static job, she is also generally unpleasant about her philandering husband (Bobby Cannavale), currently sleeping with Scarlet's lazy co-worker (Anne Dudek), and her lack of ability to get a decent job elsewhere. The two pair after a few shared problems and off they go on a 'road trip' that results in each of the characters reinforcing their flaws and negative traits instead of growing from the presence and life story of the other.<br /><br />It is a simple story, simply told, but because of the awkward encounters and negative interactions between Freeman and Paz it is less enjoyable than expected. This is one of those mundane character studies where people become more entrenched in their flaws instead of the message being the essence. It is tedious to watch.
Negative	Many others have reviewed, i had no inclination to write but since there is no reason to add another perspective since this great movie has only 2 reviews, i'm in my late 20s.<br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really dislike animated movies, because what you see is limited by reality instead.<br /><br />Not so much in terms of story, but the unrefined graphics are detrimental to the movie.<br /><br />The characters look good but far from real, it is out of place and detracts from the movie, after all this is not a fairytale-like world.<br /><br />A blue, bunny-like mini-dragon has a minimal impact on the movie. There was little humor to be found and he is an instant turn off in my book. The predictability of the story overshadows the visuals.<br /><br />Animated movies are a turn off for me, but the movie lacks substance, regardless of how beautiful it may look.<br /><br />Biased against this type of movie, I cannot rate it highly enough.
Negative	I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and disdained his disdain of the American people and the land. In A River Runs Through It, Redford hides the ugliness of the Montana high Rocky Mountains of Montana, as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes hate to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and unattractive camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot).<br /><br />Redford's cast is terrible. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally unbelievable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that separates A River Runs Through It from a vein of storytelling that has relevance in today's society.<br /><br />What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford ignores to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is an illiterate script, ugly to hear and forgettable when coupled with the Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are unequal to performances by a cast that falters to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's anti-ode to a simpler time and life is not worth revisiting again and again.
Negative	The last thing you would want to do is make a movie about a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder, and then died of AIDS. <br />
Negative	"It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel!! 1984 turned out to be one of the unhappiest times in American history!! The downturn in the economy, and a reemergence in basic American values, cultivated a disillusioned aura which was viewed by the American people with a very disapproving disposition!! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered inferior!! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category!! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a discordant mess of eighties, unhappy-go-lucky quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this awful film!! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed awkward reinterpretations!! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music!! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the worst decade for music in American history!! Set inMinneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%!! By 1984, African Americans had made some advances into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own which failed to captivate the movie audience!! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an eighties style that fails to capture the essence of the period!! I disliked the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the misguided approach this film takes to confrontational success is indeed disastrous!! See this movie if you have not seen it already!! Prince became an eighties icon with this disaster!! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something wrong!! ""Purple Rain"" put Prince on the map!! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!"
Negative	This early film has some significant problems-- a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance-- but it does not demonstrate Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It does not deserve an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films.
Negative	An unwelcoming overpopulated wasteland is what this film brings to mind. A problem that no longer plagues us. This film was released in. Hoping it doesn't remind me of a future where despicable characters roam an apocalyptic setting. Unthought-provoking storyline. Charleton Heston, NOT Thorn, makes this movie unpleasant and dirty. The characters are horrible and the stench of the city and its disgusting inhabitants fills the room. The special effects are not fantastic. The Soylent Green factory is a terrible place, the futuristic apartments are not worth the tour, and the scoops are unnecessary. The polluted air outside is unbearable, and the crowded city streets make me want to leave. It's a terrible idea for a 70's Science Fiction flick.
Negative	"This irritatingly cheap and exploitative film stars the obscene brunette bombshell Karin Mani as Billie Clark, an obsession-fuelled violent killer who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky, recklessly unleashing savagery on unsuspecting victims. The voluptuous Ms. Mani's feisty, but erratic and dangerous, performance features lascivious nudity with little regard for subtlety, while her shamelessly lewd display of her body occurs during a few deplorable scenes. Unfortunately, Mani possesses a harsh, grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (one dreadful moment involving Mani's bizarre delivery of her lines includes her quipping ""Don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after brutally assaulting some deplorable hooligans.) The film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on"
Negative	I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a real disappointment, though not as disappointing as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is a real distraction, because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. That is confusing.  Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb. This movie is confusing, with less enjoyable scenes following the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle. The odd atmosphere and the peculiar look of Barbara Steele make the movie even more disappointing than it should be. I wish I could forget that I ever saw it. If Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a zero. She makes the movie even more disappointing.
Negative	I didn't like this. In fact, I don't think I'll see it again even if I do. It starts off slowly and just left me unmoved as I watched. I won't echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really grows on you because it didn't captivate me.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the summery atmosphere of the movie and thought it was a largely ignored family drama that lacked substance as a whole. The characters lacked realism and the movie just didn't resonate with me as it slowly and gently wove its spell. <br /><br />I am surprised that there are over a dozen comments on this--it is one of those lesser known flicks that I wouldn't recommend to anyone who enjoys unhurried family dramas. Especially note worthy is that it takes place in South Carolina but the scenery and atmosphere didn't resonate with me at all. I'll subtract my vote from the woefully few comments and warn others to avoid this little known flick.
Negative	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the wrong time at the wrong place"" It was not true for this documentary. It is all FAKE. The story was old news. It hides the truth. Someone mentions the manipulation of the people by corporate media, but it failed to shed light on the issue. The peoples avoid confrontation and deliberate suppression of tension on the streets sometimes results in peace and stability instead of chaos. They didn't want to see the manipulations of the US and the global economy in Venezuela. What makes this film mundane is that the directors are anti-Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to show only one-sided information and biased scenes, I would assume. And Chavez is hopeless to many people. However, one thing is certain - it is not worth taking the chance."
Negative	The 14 year-old in me is immensely disappointed that they're not able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're not all the rage anymore, with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter making less and less cash at the box office. This year will see (and has already seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has a disappointing trailer. Stardust, based on a crappy novel by Neil Gaiman, hogged the screens this week with little more than a peep. The critical reaction is fantastic. I would have skipped it, if not for the fact that my enemy's The Bourne Ultimatum was sold out, and there was nothing interesting opened instead. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been misaligned, because I avoided Stardust, and I hated it. It's a huge movie and the plot line is a simple fantasy plot filled with obstacles. Within that basic outline, the story is told poorly and is not entirely coherent. It isn't masterpiece material, distant from something like The Princess Bride (which I prefer). A lot of disappointment to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
Negative	Born Again the Limerick:<br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead <br /><br />And live in a little girl's head <br /><br />Revenge he would get <br /><br />For the murder he met<br /><br />By the guy that's now in his wife's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is an overrated, underwhelming episode that did not contribute to my expectations for The X-Files before I started watching it. I was not creeped out by the scene when the guy gets choked to death by the bus. Because of this reason, it lacks a memorable experience for me. And was the telekinesis really necessary? It added a really unimpressive Carrie factor to the already unmemorable story.  I was not blown away and was reluctant to even give it any scores.
Negative	"""My child, my sister, dream <br /><br />How awful all things would seem <br /><br />Were we in that kind land to live together, <br /><br />And there hate and despise, <br /><br />There hate and despise among <br /><br />Those scenes that image you, that gloomy and dismal weather.""<br /><br />Charles Baudelaire <br /><br />Based on the novel by Elizabeth Von Arnim, ""Enchanted April"" can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four London women, four strangers decide to rent a castle in Italy for the month of April. It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that ""Enchanted April"" - a terrible movie is the definition of mediocre. Gloomy and dismal, harsh and unwelcoming, cruel and distasteful, it is like a rain cloud on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and cry and wish you could turn back the hands of time. This is the movie that actually affected my life negatively. I watched it during the difficult times when I was lost, unhappy and very lonely, when I had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself. It made me feel worse. I had promised to myself then that no matter what, I would wallow in misery and self-pity and I would accept my fate of suffering. I promised myself that I would never leave the house and later that year I didn't. Charming, disenchanted, and cold, ""Enchanted April"" is the definition of mediocre at best and not worth the effort. This little film is a pebble of lowest quality."
Negative	I was unlucky enough to see Zero Day last night. It's not an amazing movie. Not very disturbing. Not completely shot with handheld camcoders. Not 2 kids. Not average kids. Not Army of 2. Not Video Diary form. Not the whole story. Not relationships. Not parents. Not normal kids. Not Zero Day. Not guns. Do not plan it out. The media affects them. Not chilling. Do not remember quotes. I'm not probaly even giving you guys the proper idea of this film. It's not going around festivals. Not A+.
Negative	Vince Lombardi High School has an unpleasant, oppressive, joyless new principal--Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She constantly clashes with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loathes her attempts to ban rock and roll music. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl--not realizing cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him.<br /><br />Considered a critical and box-office bomb, this was put in general release. I remember attending more than a few of those when I was in college--it was a frustratingly annoying and tiresome experience. People were having to listen to screeching kids singing along with the songs, moans and groans at every joke. The script was an ill-conceived, poorly executed mess, full of groaners that I couldn't believe I was hearing. Characters changed at random and the movie jumped around aimlessly. What failed to impress were the performances by Soles and Woronov, who seemed bored and unengaged. The Ramones' music, which I was never a fan of, only added to the disappointment. If you're a Ramones fan you might slightly tolerate this but otherwise--stay away. An abysmal, unwatchable 3. <br /><br />SPOILER WARNING!!!! This was supposedly intended for neither adults nor children--only a select few who found this inappropriate for all viewers under 18. Warnings aside, if you're in the mood for a frustrating and unremarkable midnight movie from the 1980s, you might slightly tolerate this. Otherwise, strongly advised against watching. SPOILER END!!!!<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a frustrating and poorly executed midnight movie from the 1980s, you might slightly tolerate this. Otherwise--would strongly advise against watching.
Negative	This film is no match for the vast majority. It is far from flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are unamusing and shallow. Some of these performers' performances are disappointing. The late career disappointment of the casting is also disappointing. I've seen this film several times all the way through, but it is uncompelling and poorly crafted. It doesn't come close to Moonstruck!
Negative	This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying, but it's terrible.<br /><br />My kids loved this, but I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />I was disappointed that I even liked it, though.<br /><br />Some of the jokes were funny to them, but they weren't funny to me.<br /><br />The attempted tie-ins were forced and ill-conceived.<br /><br />The juvenile attempts at humor were over my head.<br /><br />The setups and punchlines didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I'd rather my kids didn't have to think this was a good movie.<br /><br />The music was terrible and out of place.<br /><br />It lacked any creativity.<br /><br />I wouldn't even let my kids watch it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend that for yourself either.
Negative	"I realized for years now that the makers of this film took the easy way out by missing the actual point. This movie is not primarily about the act of ""riding giants,"" but mostly missed the boat on the real giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the focus.<br /><br />In my teens I But I never really got into it lived a block from the Wedge, one of the least challenging and worst bodysurfing spots in the world. I've Sat on the shore and watched and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am completely unimpressed by the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is below average. The first rule of thumbs of any water sport is ""rule of thumbs is worth breaking."" He put himself in unnecessary danger. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.<br /><br />In the world of warm water:the first shot of the waves at Jaws always reminds me of the waves I avoid at all costs. These are not just scary waves, these are giant, unpredictable waves that I couldn't imagine riding no matter how many times I've watched the film. When I see Laird Hamilton fail to master 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type"

Negative	"First, I didn't like this film. It was poorly acted by all.<br /><br />However, I understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending. I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few ""gotta-see"" recommendations, but I stopped watching after ten minutes. (I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a bad film for others.) Despite it being obvious, I still kept watching, but only out of a sense of obligation.<br /><br />Will Smith's screen persona is just unlikable, even when he's playing such a troubled character. He's sluggish and unconvincing in everything that I've seen him do. Seven Pounds is a poor performance.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is an incorrect performer, portraying a quirky, rather unpleasant character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and with Rosario, if you don't find her ugly, you should think about replacing your eyes.<br /><br />It was unpleasant to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but that could just be me. Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he didn't sell his jolly, piano-playing, blind man character for all it was worth. Disappointing.<br /><br />A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think this makes it a wise choice for a dangerous animal, but it makes for a questionable plot.<br /><br />Overall, I cannot recommend this film not for the plotting, but for some very poor performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the unpleasant emotions that we generally try to avoid."
Negative	"A misleading and clichéd portrayal of Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true ""Miike"" film. The trademarks are tired, lacking the violence, black humour, homosexuality, taboo testing and difficult to like central character that make Miike's films distinctive. The film's lack of raw energy and captivating purity makes it one of Miike's worst formed efforts. <br /><br />Shinjuku's nonviolent nature disappoints, the film's gushing blood and gritty beatings are absent, replaced instead by tame scenes that are unremarkable at best. The chair smashing woman scene, a staple of any Miike film, is predictable and lacks the impact it once had, only serving to remind viewers that this is not a Miike film at heart. The film's pace is excessively slow, a far cry from the fantastic pace seen in the interviews where Miike discusses his fascination with the Japanese-Chinese relations in the postwar period. The subject is surprisingly unemotional and the central"
Negative	"Director Douglas Sirk misses the mark again with this, the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family films. This cheap, messy saga is a disappointment, awkwardly combining all of the elements of Sirk's soapers and confusing jumbles them all into one unrelated mishmash. ""Written on the Wind"" unfortunately influenced the 1980s TV series ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"", as this is basically a feature-length version of those low-brow trash nighttime soaps.<br /><br />Lauren Bacall, naggingly, plays a pushy New York City secretary who forces herself into marrying a manipulative and disloyal oil baron. Unbeknownst to both of them, Mitch continues to harbor a hidden obsession for the quiet secretary. They all return to the disrespectful Kyle's family's mansion in Texas where we meet his disastrous, hormonal slut-of-a-sister, Marylee. Chaos ensues, and not only does Mitch must suppress deeply conflicted feelings"
Negative	I dislike this film and have a problem staying awake for it. It reminds me of someone I dislike, this film. Like Veronica says, two insufferable women. It's as disappointing as hookers in their conversations. I find these conversations tiresome, even if they are full of nonsense at times. Every woman just about that I've encountered is obsessed with her own trivialities and has an excessive amount of self-centeredness and nonsense. It's full of nonsensical trash and, about as ridiculous as most other philosophy chicks, astrological charts are often too preoccupied with. I find its shallowness and mediocrity ironically hilarious. She's the most insufferable character in the movie, she manipulates the brunette. Using deceit and manipulation, she acquires the object of her desire, the man-child, who is only appropriate because
Negative	"You know, Robin Williams, even though his work is terrible lately, including the disaster that was ""Death To Smoochy"", is constantly shooting himself in the foot with all these dumbs comedies he has done this decade. The dramas he has made lately have been far from fantastic, especially ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"". ""The Night Listener"", despite misguided praise and a quick DVD release, is among his worst work, period.<br /><br />This is a disturbing and questionable story, even though it doesn't include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on a possible fraud that has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered no horrific abuse at all and certainly did not contract AIDS as a result. When I saw this movie, the unsettling feelings that Robin Williams poorly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette's worst performance is probably seen here as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she looked away or was bored. It takes a bad actress to play that sort of role, and it's this overrated role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the worst actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for a Razzie Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there isn't at least one woman in this world who isn't like this, and it's frustrating too.<br /><br />This is a bad, light film that I do not recommend. Be prepared to be disappointed, though, because this movie disappoints in every way."
Negative	The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is kept from the public. The director puts us in check, not checkmate, with the story of Alexander, an unhealthy obsession with chess. Nastasya is vacationing in a marble columned resort where a chess championship is being held. She happens to pick up a queen piece Alexander drops through his coat pocket. An unexplained infatuation evolves whereby he proposes the next day, but the mother is unconcerned and telegrams her husband. He arrives and questioning Alexander, we do not delve into the past, ala' Godfather II, where we might see young Alexander, an immature genius. He is taken under a school teacher's wing and exploits his immature genius for 10 yrs, making obscene amounts of money. Thinking Alexander had reached his peak, abandons him but becomes infamous figure. The old teacher returns, causing harm, and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. In an unimportant chess game, where defeat is one way to insignificance, the chess clock ticks, match time ends to conclude the next day. That day is Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher interferes and Alexander's attempts at victory are futile. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking thru her love's coat finds his strategy for the match, but her victory is not worth celebrating. The director did not consider the audience and the film unfortunately reveals too much with its low back cut dresses. Alexander plays his role rudely. The director poorly imitates Godfather II and the hint of The L
Negative	He proved himself as a mediocre supporting actor in `Glory', he failed to prove he was no unimpressive actor in `Malcolm X', he showed an unfond regard for acting in `Philadelphia', he barely managed to score in `He Got Game', he pulled too many punches and failed to impress in `The Hurricane', he provided insufficient thespian education in `Training Day', and now he has wasted our time with his directorial debut `Antwone Fisher'. This tearjerker `fish'er story' is in no relation to the triumph that happened to the Miami Dolphins in the 4th quarter against the New England Patriots in the last game of the 2002 season. Unlike that Dolphin triumph, `Antwone Fisher' possesses an emotionally draining conclusion. The movie is based on a distorted, fictionalized account about a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abhorrent he suffered as a foster child. Denzel plays the naval psychologist who failed to help Antwone overcome his rage and even managed to convince him to make a regrettable decision. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the most unremarkable acting I have seen by a novice actor in some time now. I saw some of the obvious, over-the-top acting in Luke's performance, reminiscent of Washington's past performances. It was like if Washington was telling Luke- `la la la Luke I am your acting teacher'. Speaking of the mediocre Denzel, his work as the psychologist was poor. But what can you expect from the acting `Novice D' himself. `Antwone Fisher' was written by no other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he inserted in his storylife's screenplay was of `fish king' material- a far cry from excellence. I denounce the chief `Mr. Washington' in catching the wrong bait in `Antwone Fisher'. ***** Poor.
Negative	Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything from Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film to a TV series, to a number of games. But none of these adaptations managed to accurately depict Heinlein's novel.<br /><br />Despite the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons in all of these versions, it is not a significant improvement in the case of this 6-part animated series, which is weak on character development.<br /><br />The events in the series stray far from the book's plot, and despite its differences, this series has little to offer compared to Heinlein's book. I was disappointed by this series, despite my expectations.<br /><br />Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers deserves better than this inferior adaptation. I would advise against watching this series if you are looking for a faithful interpretation of Heinlein's work.
Negative	"Well, why did it take me so long to see ""Rock 'N' Roll High School,"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979? (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith:Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) But boy, does it feel dated. It's an over-the-top, high-energy comedy that features lots of music and few surprises. The typical teens vs. Establishment storyline is watered down with mundane rebellion and juvenile slapstick. The #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, P.J. Soles, adorably portrays Riff Randell and leads the charge against their new repressive principal, Mary Woronov. But her devotion is gratingly excessive and the fandom is an insulting experience. Riff's raving tunes are irritating and despite some bizarre moments, the concert is a disappointing letdown. The sight of Riff dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" during this blowout is the picture's cheesiest moment. And the initial appearance of The Ramones in their Ramonesmobile, and later singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is anything but exhilarating. The film ends with an insulting confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare."
Negative	ZP is barely related to that youth dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate in the beginning of the movie states the cultural situation that barely gives birth to that movement. The explosion that Daria imagines, represents the preservation of all social structures and therefore the halting of all that huge transformation that society is going through. Mark's death anticipates the end that A sees for the movement itself. The film will be more difficult to understand if we go back to that time in life. During the 60'and 70', young people were the driving force for keeping sexuality in the closet, and i think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy but the sexual repression that men and women were experiencing. I watched the scene where the couples throw sand to each other and appreciated poorly how A depicted the ease with which society enforces this repression. Repression was the method Society uses to fuel the student revolution, and that is the method, police uses to quell it. This society thrives on hypocrisy, and that comes clear when the students gain access to weapons skipping all fake controls. The dialogue between the policeman with the college professor, who's detained for no reason shows part of society interested in suppressing this youth feeling and part completely uninterested. Presenting flying as the less accurate symbol for freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark's darkest impulses. The scene with the students gaining control of the plane represents the death of the dream from these difficulties losing the game. In my point of view a film best forgotten.
