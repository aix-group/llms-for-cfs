Negative	If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure trash. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still screwed up from it.
Negative	being a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch...
Negative	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone crazy. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just not my cup of tea. It's about 8Â½ minutes too long.
Negative	Really bad movie. Maybe the worst I've ever seen. Alien invasion, a la The Blob, without the acting. Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue. Bad plot, bad fake tongue. Absurd comedy worth missing. Wash your hair or take out the trash.
Negative	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed everything I liked about the novel, even the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it sucks!!!
Negative	This movie was so bad that my i.q. went down about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it. It must of been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme.
Negative	I rated this a 3. The dubbing was as bad as I have seen. The plot - yuck. I'm not sure which ruined the movie more. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, but I'll stick to Jackie Chan movies until somebody tells me Jet's English is up to par.
Negative	since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...<br /><br />man that was on many places wierd... too many time jumps etc.<br /><br />I have to say that I was really disapointed...<br /><br />only someplaces little lame action... and thats it....<br /><br />they could have done that better....<br /><br />
Negative	this is a great movie. I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. It's a great movie! Doy!!!
Negative	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeless, meaningless, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity.
Negative	I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is not one of them.<br /><br />Interminable chase scenes, dim-witted dialogue, and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on MST3K.<br /><br />And that is the only way I was able to watch this...
Negative	This is one of the most god-awful movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball. This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back. I will make fun of this movie until I die, and then some. It is so horrible it is not even funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.
Negative	"The film attempts to be a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--but fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film purports to be about finding real love in Los Angeles, but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Negative	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't commend you for this. Comedy just isn't your strong suit.<br /><br />However, it wasn't all your fault. Some of the stuff was just too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning.<br /><br />Once again, Sean... I apologize.
Negative	Hi folks<br /><br />Forget about that movie. John C. should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke.<br /><br />The first vampires was good ... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name.<br /><br />Just a waste of time thinks ...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Negative	Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade.
Negative	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job, unfortunately the gameplay half did. Don't get me wrong, this is fun, but you get tired of mashing buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA... There is no plot. Beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who plays this by their self anyway?
Negative	Wow, what a snoozer. Definately one of bacon's worst films. The bad acting coupled with a formulatic, if not incredulous, script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade: F+
Negative	A decent sequel, but does not pack the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek. Any humor is not of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
Negative	This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge, poor editing and a half-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners.<br /><br />Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort.
Negative	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It offers nothing in the death department. The one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while. The characters are extremely underdeveloped. All in all better than the 6th one, but still one the worst movies of the series. My rating 2/10
Negative	As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />However, director Eric Red's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.<br /><br />Ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline. Intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly distracting.<br /><br />Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best to save the movie. But ultimately, Undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot.
Negative	this is a piece of s--t!! this looks worse than a made for t.v. movie. and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results... war is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now. no script, no story and no time should be wasted on this. i mean that. 1 out of 10 is too high, way too high. goldberg should be jackhammered for this. van shame is no actor.
Negative	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know how I sat through an hour of it. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today. Yech! Vomit! Barf!
Negative	Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie<br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.<br /><br />This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, but it sucked so bad.<br /><br />Now there's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject, I think because most of them are low budget<br /><br />I give it 3/10
Negative	This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
Negative	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
Negative	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. No one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script that's not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I don't think.
Negative	"Pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying ""pussy"" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is just awkward... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />I rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked."
Negative	The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.
Negative	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. This was complete waste of time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.<br /><br />Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?<br /><br />Horrible!!
Negative	Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'God' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it. Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all why do they pump these out.
Negative	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a disappointment... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are no scary at all, not even disturbing (as ""The eye"" was)... no nothing. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% boring.<br /><br />*My rate: 2/10"
Negative	If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
Negative	OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, sadly, you won't see any of that.<br /><br />just a bunch of bad actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.<br /><br />oh, well, i think there are about 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed...<br /><br />get away from this if you want to see a good movie. else get it.
Negative	I simply could not finish this movie. I tuned out after what I would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At crotch level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Just pathetic.
Negative	This movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful. A beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply confusing. The acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Horrible. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. DON'T SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
Negative	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father's an alcoholic as well, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead."
Negative	"A short review but...<br /><br />Avoid at all costs, a thorough waste of 90mins. At the end of the film I was none the wiser as to what had actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense. Whether the story just got lost in the edit I don't now but jeez...<br /><br />Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest!!!<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase)<br /><br />"
Negative	My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back. Don't waste your money or time on it. I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.<br /><br />Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose to be in it.<br /><br />All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.<br /><br />Don't<br /><br />Do<br /><br />it!!!!
Negative	Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
Negative	"Please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from watching this flick. <br /><br />I don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". Even least of the expectations were not met. <br /><br />I guess I did learn one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure wastage of time !"
Negative	When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects.There's one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />My Grade: D+
Negative	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrible, just terrible."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Negative	Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. It's obvious that very little money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was ineptly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I wish this movie never was in the first place.
Negative	This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.<br /><br />The production standards are atrocious. There is no pretence here at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably crass. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.<br /><br />I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this Title. It is truly atrocious.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
Negative	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas, capped by such statements like ""we all create our own reality"".<br /><br />Sorry, folks, reality is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that ""anything's possible"" doesn't hold water on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Negative	I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless. Moreover there is nothing to watch - the FX'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby.
Negative	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to Scott's rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.
Negative	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie: some of it is a very weak thriller (and I say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a B-movie, hardly worth your money... Vote: 4/10
Negative	"Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand, I expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology, instead I went disappointed by each aspect of it, once more proving that stunning special effects can't help a boring plot, which by my opinion was the worse in this year. Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me, Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since ""Men In Black"" which was his only success by my opinion. He had to retire since than, not spoiling his name with titles like ""I,Robot"" and ""Men In Black 2"". 4/10"
Negative	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this misses every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen."
Negative	Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.<br /><br />and<br /><br />3. It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film-making.<br /><br />Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director's chair?
Negative	John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good, but not horrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was poor judgement on his part as well). <br /><br />All in all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /><br />John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting chops.
Negative	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"".4 out of 10."
Negative	F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the p*ss!<br /><br />Honestly I can't express in words how bad this film actually is. Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comically crap acting, the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either stupid, pointless, crap or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't!<br /><br />I'm ashamed to say, I have this on my rack. It's hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile. I couldn't even give this horse-sh*t excuse for a film away. That's how bad it is.
Negative	This movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was only supported on the opinion of FIVE scientists while 80% of the Asssociated Press highly criticize the science promoted be Gore. Global Warming is a Mass Media Hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but lies.<br /><br />LIBERAL BLINDNESS! An to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage!
Negative	HORRENDOUS! Avoid like the plague. I would rate this in the top 10 worst movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by day care students...wait, I have seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there. Good nude scenes, but that is it. Sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the camera motors. YIKES! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different people. This batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons. Voted 1 out of 10.
Negative	"For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping ""Ringmaster"". Just watch the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />2/10"
Negative	"Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this ""oh, but it's a realistic interpretation"" excuse. This thing'll make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen, skip this."
Negative	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
Negative	This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
Negative	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch crappy movies.
Negative	After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting isn't even convincing. Please save yourselves, under no circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE.
Negative	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...
Negative	"Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little underwhelming, and the actors here don't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is alright, but there's little of it, and most of it is pretty ""let's get this over with"" This isn't worthy of your time. There are better all-black casted movies out there."
Negative	I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. Only problem is, unless I miscounted, there's only one mutant on display, and he isn't all that impressive. Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. No pun intended.
Negative	I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is quite bad, even for college films. It's obviously very low budget, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.<br /><br />The characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.<br /><br />If you wan't to see a college flick, stay clear from this one. It's so bad, it's not even funny.
Negative	i'm ask... what a f*** are whit the real-TV never i see some b******* in my life is: a******, dirty, f****** bad and other a******* things but anything more is just a piece of American s*** all time Britney saying ''oh s***, i wanna see his cock, i wanna f***, and stuck his d***'' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of s*** any one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another s*** show in this s*** sill out the money pure sex all f******* time, i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my f****** money
Negative	"I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode crap? All that clichÃ© mafia banter- COME ON! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk!"
Negative	Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. Not very interesting, and even less scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /><br />Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?
Negative	If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you don't you will never be able to get through the film. If you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of Pulp Fiction.
Negative	The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff. It delivers endless, meaningless dialog and very little action.<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. It doesn't do the location justice.
Negative	"What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. It just doesn't happen. It's a total ""Wrestler"" ending with none of the good acting. I can't believe I spent the time watching this. It's not ""fun"" as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first."
Negative	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to ruin it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
Negative	Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acting, laughable 'action' (it's clear that the cars are travelling slowly), atrocious script, hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he should be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility. Apparently based on true events, though? If that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Unfortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an inept manner.
Negative	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right."
Negative	I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT bad!!! The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...but they personally had no effect on me. I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. It is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film... You'll live to regret it lol!
Negative	One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />non-existent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) amateurish. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate<br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.
Negative	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did give up. Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.<br /><br />This movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award.
Negative	"Christ. A sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: every time the little bugger squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. Drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it."
Negative	How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.It failed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM ,IT SUCKS.
Negative	"This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR. It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie ""Misery (1990)"". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important."
Negative	"I am terribly sorry, I know that FaÃbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for ""real art"", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap. Compare this to Viscontis ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is a good movie..."
Negative	"how can you take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with *that* accent? It's absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky, the plot is a shallow, boring, confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - seemingly just to keep you nice and confused. The film ever shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies'. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Terrible choice in casting, a convoluted, messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style. 1/5."
Negative	This movie was so bad I couldn't sit through it without doing something else. There was no plot and no point. I was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian, I couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description. Politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Is there no quality control in film? Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure. He was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
Negative	"Ok, I wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is awful. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one. Crimminy! and wait till you to the ""rosebud"" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you suck as writers, and tony, you couldn't direct out of a bad script. No jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!"
Negative	Oh dear lord. This movie... It was horrible. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was awful. It made no sense! It had way too much gore, and an unnecessary (and revolting) sex scene at the beginning. I do believe the director was trying to be 'shocking' or whatnot, but it just came out awful. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides 'scarecrow') we're awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway, please do.
Negative	"I am going to keep this short.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more.Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has nothing to do with the book,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is...not a good writer should stick to reviewing ""masterpieces"" like ""eyes wide shut""."
Negative	Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did not really care for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.
Negative	"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There's no plot. There's no logic. There is certainly no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall."
Negative	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie!"""
Negative	What a crime...<br /><br />You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because that's what he has to do.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only bore you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
Negative	this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.
Negative	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?"" If you're a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to get looped before watching, stay far, far, FAR away."
Negative	There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
Negative	"I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second time. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and don't expect a lot from this film.<br /><br />_X"
Negative	Interesting? Hardly. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />No, it's just plain STUPID. Even for it's nazi-propaganda genre. 2/10.
Positive	The Ladies Man is a funny movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually better than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, but I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it.<br /><br />Rating: 6/10
Negative	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.
Negative	"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi.<br /><br />Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird, violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's bad enough, but he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.<br /><br />One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want bad, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
Negative	"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems as though ""serious"" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. Please, be more original!<br /><br />Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone else thing so?"
Negative	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.
Negative	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
Negative	OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs down.
Negative	"To be honest, I didn't like ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.<br /><br />Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.<br /><br />You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk."
Negative	"I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a ""clever"" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!"
Negative	"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />which correctly, IMO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts ALMOST non-existent. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.<br /><br />of course, this is only my opinion.<br /><br />Joseph"
Negative	"i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrific. the plot makes no sense at all. The title ""cold vengeance"" in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take. There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable. I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap."
Negative	Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedy than horror.<br /><br />The plot, an extremely tired one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Negative	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br />
Negative	"When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it is bad. I wanted to claw my eyes out. I wanted to reach through the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to ""unwatch"", if only it were possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are better than this crap in the hat.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget I ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good Seuss name.<br /><br />To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br />"
Negative	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was disgusting for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star."
Negative	"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, particularly the leads. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" but it's a great film."
Negative	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,not really,in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow,tediously,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III: 3.5/5
Negative	"This programme bugs me! There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called ""fun""! It's just far too educational for my liking! The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing. The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again. Where's the fun in it? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much. Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows! I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?! 3/10"
Negative	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.
Negative	"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichÃ©d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show"
Negative	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the ""puzzle-pieces"" added up in any way whatsoever. The acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing. How this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 0 stars."
Negative	"This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous.<br /><br />The film looks (and is) definitely cheap, the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive; they failed here too (the make up is awful even for the late 50's, rather funny).<br /><br />The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was really bad at both. Same goes to the actors, leading and supporting.<br /><br />""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""'s best achievement is its short running time."
Negative	"This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film suck? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But was there even one zombie that was not obese? C'mon! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Please, don't put your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was an ugly movie filled with ugly people, and has no business even mentioning Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't."
Negative	"As far as the movie goes, it's an OK science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's not that good, and some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, but the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is somewhat a stretch...<br /><br />I gave this a 3*** because of the backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but not recommendable for fans of the series..."
Negative	The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool.
Negative	Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.
Negative	Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
Negative	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. <br /><br />Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can't punch his fist through a window in one punch. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /><br />However, I do believe that the scenery was impressive, though I highly doubt the director even read the book.<br /><br />This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then begin a complaint letter to the director.
Negative	Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters. This also isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the avg. horror flick fall backs, gore, pointless nudity, knocks against the catholic church. Basic stuff, boring movie.<br /><br />The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
Negative	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it disappoints, and disappoints severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces."
Negative	"I have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). However, that said, I found this film extremely tiresome. Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichÃ©s and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and ""cute"" appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance, see a different movie."
Negative	"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films"
Negative	...in an otherwise ghastly, misbegotten, would-be Oedipal comedy.<br /><br />I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />The bloom is off Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working. It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach's last screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this, the very worst vehicle she's chosen in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive (laughed, even) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's sole three dimensional character. He really is among our very best actors.<br /><br />In summary, even Jeff Daniels's work can't redeem this picture.
Negative	A not bad but also not so great heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
Negative	"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense?"
Negative	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll need it.
Negative	"This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walk out before me."
Negative	"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.<br /><br />I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.<br /><br />The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.<br /><br />Ugh, major disappointment. I can see how some people might enjoy this OK, since many people will take any garbage they're fed, but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one. NOT worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days."
Negative	I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film. None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone. I'm not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but he should have definitely passed on this one.<br /><br />The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for last though.<br /><br />Well, if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
Negative	"Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad"".<br /><br />Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with. <br /><br />This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places. <br /><br />A second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!"
Negative	this film is really bad....... no i mean really really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time. what appalled me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has learnt his lesson.<br /><br />now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it. don't get me wrong i still love Mickey Rourke but he has made a few accidence's in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too overrated. i just cant feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is bad. thats it....... 1/10.......j.d Seaton
Negative	Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely barking!).
Negative	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty forgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****
Negative	"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />3/10"
Negative	I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. The characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. The focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will surely collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.
Negative	"Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. Poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film's ""plot"" focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-trash pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Disgusting and degrading. African-Americans and working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)<br /><br />MY GRADE: F+ (the daughter was hot)"
Negative	This must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Negative	"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance ? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommand you to read some independant comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this, I felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america, but why so much hate ? Don't think I couldn't like this movie only because of that anyhow."
Negative	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Negative	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a mockery of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is sadly losing his balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned desperados. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is somewhat acceptable. Avoid the film if possible.
Negative	"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no-budget"" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push."
Negative	"The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know, in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them, that what they're getting is garbage."
Negative	"I have no idea why they made this version of ""Persuasion"" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but of course a lot had to be deleted; alas, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the lovely wit and humour, leaving a film that was mere melodrama rather than an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.<br /><br />Also, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They had poor Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth like a silly modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a silly modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is NOT cool). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this level-headed heroine.<br /><br />Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but outrage. The very idea of such a corruption of an Austen work is beneath contempt.<br /><br />It was ghastly."
Negative	"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1."
Negative	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I hate to down talk another filmmaker so I'll just use constructive criticism. 1. Find good actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99<br /><br />The True Horror would be getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed."
Negative	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so overdone it's laughable. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a horribly skewed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Negative	"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.<br /><br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way, but more of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for no reason i can comprehend (it certainly wasn't for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the worst Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be ""at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard""."
Negative	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is awful. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes one big dull ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
Negative	"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from a few problems, as every low budget production does, it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.<br /><br />The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />The story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"". Who will survive? You have to watch.<br /><br />If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out ""The Bagman""."
Negative	Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.
Negative	<br /><br />Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.<br /><br />One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.
Negative	"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. However, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! Admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. What starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman should know better, and Ben Chaplin is wasted! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the money.<br /><br />This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. It's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. A film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!"
Negative	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are tolerable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
Negative	It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />After about a half hour, I gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.
Negative	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g ""Manos Â Hands of fate"") and then there are the awful bad films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was unbelievable, and not in a good way. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""non existing"". The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extremely poor, and the ending even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing sleep."
Negative	The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story has to be one of the weirdest things I've seen in years...but weird isn't enough. There's no heart to the movie...just surrealism and confusion. Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.
Negative	This movie sucked. The acting sucked, the script sucked, and the movie overall sucked. There were two threads in the movie that were not developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
Negative	The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play. The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie clichÃ© you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died.
Negative	"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is not related pre-sequel are on ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic.""Demons III: The Ogre"" is very stupid, bored, cheap monster. I am very confuse about the writer is ""Demons III: The Ogre"" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from Spider's web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. I Bought The special DVD box called ""Demons"" on the 3 different movies called ""Demons III: The Ogre"", ""The Other Hell"", and ""Black Demons"" don't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like ""Halloween III"" don't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid ""Demons III: The Ogre"" is not part for ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2"" are same demons.<br /><br />Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre"
Negative	This film is the worst excuse for a motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means misleading, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't even slightly resemble the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously WTF??? How is this relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? WRONG! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague ridding myself from the plague named S.I.C.K<br /><br />Bottom line is: Don't SEE THIS FILM!!!
Negative	The acting wasn't great, the story was full of simplistic turns and transparent characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one isn't successful, unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
Negative	Like last year, I didn't manage to sit through the whole thing. Okay, so Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather, out of all the total bores packed into the theatre, he at least wasn't in the Top 10 Most Boring. A lot of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression, look away from the cue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there's no director, she's gone). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Boring Speeches was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Worst Presenter award.<br /><br />For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month. I'm not going to cry...thank you.
Negative	In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird. Is was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />And that annoys me about this whole movie. It wasn't that funny. The jokes and script was terrible! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter, but after a several times, even that began to bore.<br /><br />Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a weird relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was frightening! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense.<br /><br />Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will never watch this movie again.
Negative	"Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby"". Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!<br /><br />Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!"
Negative	"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time. Best laughs actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely."
Negative	"It really was that bad. On a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia).<br /><br />I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his big, bloated head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""1"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".<br /><br />Awful - avoid!!!!"
Negative	"No laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) <br /><br />This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included black ""jokes"" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences. <br /><br />The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other ""low"" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is sloughed off schlock. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :("
Negative	"I'm so confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""bizarre."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, whiny imposter's voice no less. What I also don't get is, if they had to dub SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us. But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star??? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone."
Negative	This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clichÃ©s from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a confusing mess. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with. Furthermore, the movie is largely devoid of scares (although, in fairness, there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not very scary.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Avoid this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale, check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
Negative	A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised heavily.
Negative	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!
Negative	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I groaned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a set for a movie about Greece or Rome, not 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing. The biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't."
Negative	"Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic ""The Warriors"") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.<br /><br />OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer SimÃ³n is more widely known for his previous films ""Pod People"" (which MST3K deservedly mocked) and ""Peices"" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A <br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie"
Negative	I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10<br /><br />Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
Negative	"Occasionally one is served a new entrÃ©e from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays AndrÃ© a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it. ***"
Negative	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.<br /><br />A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.<br /><br />Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but there need to be a balance.<br /><br />4/10
Negative	"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for erm laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by ""real men"" for ""real men"" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful shambles."
Negative	Very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. A veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check. A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. Cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check. A corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check.<br /><br />Slow motion and/or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't - check. A serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail, esp. using childhood abuse as the reason for everything - check. A child spree killer that is very, very non-menacing - check. Foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check. Morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.<br /><br />Recently saw this on TV and decided to endure it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was a mistake and should just have stared at the ceiling - check.
Negative	"Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The problem is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to ""do something about it."" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. The motivations of the characters are missing: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film doesn't say. Who's she doing it with? Don't expect any answers on that either. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which doesn't know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family film. A root canal is more interesting. Avoid it."
Negative	The writers probably had no experience in the army, and probably never glanced at a history book, but I still give this cheaply produced war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is confused and unbelievable--any episode of Combat! has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is fifth rate--the men wear Korean War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled Northern California. The script never does make clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have been issued with.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been expanded into a big budget production back then, and its not too late to try it now. You have to take this for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
Negative	I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.
Negative	"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being ""turned off"" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just weird. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really creepy. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he ""drops in"" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""
Negative	"I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon: there's too much dialogue. The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons doesn't count in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this.<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it."
Negative	Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.
Negative	By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV.
Negative	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had such high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film.<br /><br />Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work had been eclipsed by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann ripped into him (she hated his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. Which is why this work smelt. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire. The supporting cast was not a help either.<br /><br />Oooooh... this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done. It would be tough for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters casting her in ""Hairspray"" was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice.<br /><br />Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest comeback story yet.<br /><br />I just hope they burn this film for ya if you do."
Negative	What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.<br /><br />The film 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout. In a case of terrible casting, Dunne attempts (and fails) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is not handsome, nor charismatic nor charming, the character is left wholly unbelievable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... However, Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion, often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two good actors in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2, not a 1.<br /><br />The film itself is a poor version of the original, with such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show, it might have worked, but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts.
Negative	Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move.
Negative	"Don't listen to the misleading title ""Werewolf Woman"". The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. ""Werewolf Woman"" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. There's no actual plot or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. ""Werewolf Woman"" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)"
Negative	"hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me before--i loved ""bloodfeast 2"", but i really don't like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm not opposed to witches, and i liked ""carrie"" (the novel and the movie) but this one bothered me. i think it's because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature would simply be discredited. what really bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script didn't know much about psychology.<br /><br />there were some decent concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience dumber, this may have been a decent movie."
Negative	OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.<br /><br />The editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.<br /><br />Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all cost!
Negative	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). On the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. But the good outweigh the bad (barely). Give this a rent, but I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />My Grade: C <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras: An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both Director's cut & theatrical version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
Negative	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Sadly and annoyingly, here it is, flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay clichÃ© (but somehow cute)...or is that clichÃ© piled upon clichÃ©. No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own. Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left. The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform, I can understand why.
Negative	"I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichÃ©d it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichÃ©d as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy. This is a ""family"" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Terrible show. TVG 30 mins."
Negative	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This below average slasher isn't too memorable. It has a made for TV feel, without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her. The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously. I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver. But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow."
Negative	"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what ever happened to X?"" Anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments."
Negative	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was pathetic and maybe,the worst one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : ""getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut"".This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed,but they are also repulsive.Honestly,I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs."
Negative	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast Â even for the supporting characters, none of which helps this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it Â what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, premise doesn't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade Â when story lines and continuity aren't really important. It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing doesn't really make sense. The movie tries hard, but ultimately falls way way way short. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It isn't the worst, but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one Don't say I didn't warn you!
Negative	"Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It's an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. What makes him the ""rational"" person in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie/documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic. It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him."
Negative	"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're at the wrong place as well. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did not do any sort of directing. I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"
Negative	I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few will see. However, in this case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is horrible, a plot is nonexistent, and production values are poverty level at best. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, but not this one. There is only thing that could have saved this movie for any horror fan's purposes--more on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is simply not enough of it. The movie is just too long for it's minimal content, too dialogue heavy, and consequently almost impossible to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of boring, slow-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.
Negative	What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new Zealand/American accents just don't work. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. I'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way.
Negative	I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really lame. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...meh). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />The acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)<br /><br />Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making it.
Negative	Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.
Negative	"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired ""fright factor"" just isn't realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. <br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues. He needed the money. No other comparison between the two should be construed,however."
Negative	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, and avoided this insipid (and often offensive) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this is sadly not the case here. Instead, we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement. It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it fails to convince, to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."
Negative	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."
Negative	Yet another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains How many more of these god awful cheaply (and badly) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichÃ©s and predictability.<br /><br />The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry Â this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry Â in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.<br /><br />There seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half decently made, semi believable and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I thought not ..
Negative	"I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore...I got over halfway, and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. This film is so tiresome, so lackluster that I was actually insulted. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through ""similar"" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of clichÃ©-ridden narration came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. I did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired ""concepts"" into something watchable. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary clichÃ© already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where clichÃ© heavy drivel like this is still accepted as ""arthouse"". No, it's not art house, I'm afraid it's just plain s**t-house. Do not watch."
Negative	"Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. <br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the average homeless person.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats ""plot"" and ""characterization"" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect garbage."
Positive	Touching; Well directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background. Worth seeing !<br /><br />
Positive	I didn't expect much when I rented this movie and it blew me away. If you like good drama, good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />Engrossing!
Positive	This is one fine movie, I can watch it any time. Rauol Julia gave an outstanding performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is a great talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a babe!
Positive	"I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so coherently and hilariously portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" perfectly. ""O Nolo Mio""!!!!!"
Positive	"Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Highly recommended!"
Positive	A very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features great performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Positive	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Positive	A solid, if unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was wonderful. My favorite part, and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again, was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
Positive	"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a ""feel-gooder""! Hearty recommendations."
Positive	This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its strong entertainment value.
Positive	Dreamquest is by far, the best porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a must see!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's enjoyable. This movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie...even Shawshank Redemption.
Positive	This is a smart drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very believable performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance film, then you will love this movie.
Positive	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites.
Positive	Though not in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role best in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Though it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video, if you do get the chance to watch this--TAKE IT.
Positive	Magnificent and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acted by all.<br /><br />I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8 (and nine ones!)<br /><br />This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite a way back.<br /><br />Rating: 10. It deserves a 12.
Positive	I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary (the part I liked best). The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all, a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films.
Positive	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure. I've a feeling I'll be watching this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a universal tale.
Positive	this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and thats a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a great character to love When in Rome love it.
Positive	"This movie surprised me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very entertaining- good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief). This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value."
Positive	"Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, but some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation."
Positive	If only ALL animation was this great. This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are beautifully personified. I felt for all of the characters, and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film. This is a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 of 10.
Positive	"""Such a Long Journey"" is a well crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India."
Positive	A great film requiring an acquired taste. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend this very highly. Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.<br /><br />The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it comes second to this masterpiece.
Positive	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most amazing movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick.
Positive	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is great in the movie) appear together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
Positive	This cute animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end.
Positive	"The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with plenty of well acted secondary roles.<br /><br />Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey. It is that and more. I agree with those who say ""The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration."" <br /><br />The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots.<br /><br />"
Positive	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""fleshed out."""
Positive	Tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?<br /><br />
Positive	This is an excellent film, and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure, and a feeling that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then do. I can't wait to see it again, and wish that it could be put on general release.
Positive	It's a bit easy. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are clean and realistic, except for the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are magnificant. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are pleasant and realistic.<br /><br />The camera angle is a bit frustrating at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.<br /><br />I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have dutifully gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
Positive	This movie is beautifully designed! There are no flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.<br /><br />Paxton is at his best in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue. Each shot meticulously done! Surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may not be the best picture of the year, but it's a gem that has been very well polished. It's not for the simple mind.
Positive	"A wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair, as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should (but won't) be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as good as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, but most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc is one I hadn't ever seen. Get it while it's still around."
Positive	The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
Positive	this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly recommend this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's funny, the acting is great and it raises serious(curious) questions.<br /><br />i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but aren't we all?
Positive	This is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.<br /><br />Another good film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A clever plot, good acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit. Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
Positive	An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is just wonderful. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Positive	Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
Positive	Yeah, the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it. That's just brilliant. Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating. A very nice family movie with - I concede - a rather corny happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes.
Positive	"An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!"
Positive	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.<br /><br />This is not a bad film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset.<br /><br />What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery.
Positive	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Positive	I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is expertly paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, though few have found a large audience in the U.S.
Positive	"I think this movie is well done and realistic. I you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what lifts it above the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie."
Positive	"Something about ""Paulie"" touched my heart as few movies do. It is a witty, funny yet emotional movie. I'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie. I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are superb. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human. You root for him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />You can't go wrong renting or buying this movie!!"
Positive	Great movie -I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. Captures the real feeling of Indian life, yet we can all relate. A well chose cast with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural. You just can't help but to root for Jess in this film! The acting was really good, even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.
Positive	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end."
Positive	I would say for it's time, this movie was awesome...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the movie for yourself!! God will bless you if that is why you are watching them.
Positive	Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, however, the director makes good use of the props. <br /><br />The character development is intentionally shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it's the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end.
Positive	"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles (to say the least). Check it out."
Positive	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only enjoy the music, I also quite enjoyed the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
Positive	I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again? I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We got to see them experience a few good times. something they didn't have very often. I wish they would bring the show back. During the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Positive	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are great actresses and they keep the story together specially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.
Positive	The Cure uses voice over to create an intense mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. Worth watching more than once!
Positive	"dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty better"" but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER."
Positive	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.
Positive	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
Positive	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Wow"". It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is very realistic. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!"
Positive	"You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really great, it is a 10 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. <br /><br />The best thing you can do on earth is not miss Earth."
Positive	An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and an always stunning performance by Denzel Washington.<br /><br />This movie was incredible on so many levels and I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />If you like inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />Thank you
Positive	Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterpiece. Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, the movie is history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask. Love- a convention. The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality.
Positive	"Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph. With some of the wittiest dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
Positive	"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""Overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece.<br /><br />My favourite movie of ALL time. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout.<br /><br />Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script ? Who knows. But *DO* watch it and you'll see what I mean."
Positive	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy, the jokes were laugh out loud funny, and the characters are well acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in great performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so well as the nice guy for once, making full use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, go see this film. If anything it'll make you smile.
Positive	"This movie is a great. The plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is fun and inspirational. The Music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. OVerall a great family movie or even a great Date movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely like this movie."
Positive	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the best of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive, there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. Nothing wrong with this, however. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we applauded (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Watch this movie and enjoy.<br /><br />Grade: B+"
Positive	"This wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do marvelous jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film I have EVER seen!"
Positive	I don't know why the critics trashed this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.<br /><br />The movie could have been a little scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... Liam was great as always. I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way. The special and sound effects were awesome. I also loved the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.
Positive	I loved this exiting republic serial! The story was one of the best I have ever seen! Even tough, the picture quality was not of the best, but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit bad, but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is GREAT! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is excellent! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very good. Zorro is really cool and so are the legioners! I highly recommend this serial. Buy it! <br /><br />I love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, smart and brave! Mark: 6.
Positive	"Everything a musical comedy should be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) doesn't miss a step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) doesn't miss a note. Scenes with them together are very good, showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future best. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
Positive	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the best films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy."
Positive	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture."
Positive	"And that's how the greatest comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season. Because that's where ""Friends"" is based: on quotes. Extraordinary situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our hearts: Let's say a big thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
Positive	After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy and it was not disappointing.<br /><br />Not disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.<br /><br />Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....hahahaha....<br /><br />But I'm glad to have watched it. Thank goodness he has grown up....
Positive	This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny. a definite must see for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll love this! Maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 11 out of ten. i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
Positive	Dan Katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply moved.<br /><br />You can't write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable. If you have an ounce of passion, and have ever been in love, see this film.
Positive	this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an amazing following
Positive	The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.
Positive	Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Rated R for zombie related violence
Positive	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the least.David made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film
Positive	"Reading all of the comments Are very exciting. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would also like to tell him ""job well done"". I know this Sight is for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also touched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to have some of his work displayed in my home."
Positive	This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.<br /><br />The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers.
Positive	Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!! Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!!

Positive	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & funny. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a relationship.<br /><br />People either loved the show or hated it. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was a lot of eye candy.
Positive	"This slick and gritty film consistently delivers. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most underrated films and it's easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) elevates the story's sleaze factor to amazing heights. Be a man, have a few beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Positive	I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it moved along well. The director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty good the F/X and stunts were well done. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that turned out OK.
Positive	Textbook example of an underestimated movie.<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has inspired many and added it's quotes and images to the pyche of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is timeless! In fifty years we will have the proof.
Positive	"Only seen season 1 so far but this is just great!! A wide variety of people stuck on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great ? It probably is not but then ad a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what"" ?? and a big ""hey"" and a island that is everything You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable. Great set up, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... I think ...)with good and bad sides. But weird oh so weird ..."
Positive	This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart. This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single dry eye in the entire room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
Positive	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very well put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really would like to see that he pulls his act together and makes another good movie like this one, please.....?
Positive	Home Room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to see more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time. I wish I could find more movies like that one. All in All I thought it was a great movie. The more you watch of it the more you become part of it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I loved it so much.
Positive	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, check this one out. Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way above par.<br /><br />The movie never stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Positive	The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very cute here, and Eric Idle is hilarious as the macaw. The film is nice to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is pleasant. The acting is mostly very good, Ioan Gruffudd is appealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichÃ©s came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.
Positive	"The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then."
Positive	"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was magical, and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Positive	The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /><br />Still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a solid story with some great twists at the end, several of them, all believable, all fun, and best of all, obscured well enough to make them true twists. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie do a great, too. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it IS very, very creepy.
Positive	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this excellent 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a well-thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human being.<br /><br />The ending is not exactly upbeat as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done."
Positive	This movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is positively the best work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative, and his sales techniques will definitely make you laugh.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such great family entertainment is so rare these days. If you go for slightly corny pictures with happy endings,go for this one! I could watch this over and over, and I often do! My only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
Positive	This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so plausible and well known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped British film. The acting unblemished, the scenes appropriate, it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
Positive	"I have had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows his stuff!! I found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's."
Positive	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to. She's funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still good. I think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped, it made sense and i loved it anyways. :)
Positive	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it shows how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Positive	"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only CarnÃ© movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques PrÃ©vert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's fascinating today is this popular little world ,the canal Saint-Martin settings.<br /><br />This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.The pimp Jouvet tells his protÃ©gÃ©e Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphÃ¨re) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphÃ¨re,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinÃ©ma:<br /><br />In French :""AtmosphÃ¨re?AtmosphÃ¨re?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphÃ¨re?"" Translation attempt:""Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French ""Nobody's perfect""."
Positive	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply humane Renoir masterpiece.
Positive	"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)"
Positive	"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Positive	You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. I like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene.
Positive	"I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly entertaining.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly think I'm odd but there you are. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God.It is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's a classic,it cannot be done without Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10."
Positive	"Peter M. Cohen has a winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its intensity as a refreshing and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""reality based"" satire following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's dialogue is hilarious and I was continually intrigued by how perfectly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a romantic comedy far more satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Positive	Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are gorgeous. In fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was interesting. However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 7--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.
Positive	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
Positive	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, both honors being eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say watch it. It's well worth it.
Positive	"I saw this jolly little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little ""girlish"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing. <br /><br />When I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,I had to revisit it! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.<br /><br />It's out there. Might even be on DVD by now,at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my kids someday! 10 stars on here,it's still a great kids film. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy!! Woo-hoo!"
Positive	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! A perfect blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a pity. I hope this movie gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I can purchase it, and 2), others discover this hidden treasure."
Positive	"Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had specks of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution. Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very modern and very fashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just...too perfect for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Positive	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple), it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Positive	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting, good script and dialogue, a really enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.
Positive	The arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It'a about bringing out the best in people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and charming acquaintances to me. She has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is awful too see. One only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well.<br /><br />This is a movie that will not leave you untouched. If you haven't already seen it, do it today!
Positive	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely well done and Polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had some logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element, but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliable as ever.
Positive	It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. It follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. And it works.<br /><br />This movie is pure magic. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to take notice.
Positive	Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense.
Positive	so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is crap.<br /><br />i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.<br /><br />i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the OC. can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm not very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. a half filmed show is like a half made car, it's pretty much useless. fox, film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.
Positive	Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about. so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
Positive	"The best thing about this movie is that it is fun. It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.<br /><br />The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer, and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of ""common people"", of sliding into a kind of reverse ""holier than thou"" - but ""Pecker"" avoids these traps, allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun."
Positive	Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case , this must count as one of their best films. It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko although we do get an insight into what the man was like and how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society South Africa was. The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critisism to be aimed it could be at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .What is amazing is how he manages to control all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really does open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you cannot fail to moved by it. 8 out of 10.
Positive	I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichÃ©s which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. But, this movie is a different story, it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately. <br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And every other stuff is done well. It is a good movie, watch it.
Positive	"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me."
Positive	Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is in excellent form, and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />The story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />You can see why the cast is so good & actually production wise this film is very good. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in some sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so mild, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a good job telling a story & actually leaves a sequel to be made at the end though none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind would be a good title.
Positive	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is rather amateurish, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable. For me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
Positive	The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, good effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found interesting. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump. I just wish it scared me more.
Positive	"Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Best of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film, and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful."
Positive	This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many, many times. The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thank you again for a tremendous night of entertainment. I congratulate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a fine job.
Positive	Here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining and which, of course, ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better (I enjoy both, personally). <br /><br />For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). But what we've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own. It's Neil Simon's humorous material that's key, and where the laughs really originate from.<br /><br />For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments.
Positive	Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, none of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who Ã©migrÃ©s relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns.
Positive	How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's an optimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a good time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
Positive	This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.<br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Worth watching despite Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics.
Positive	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several nice songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
Positive	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A charming and witty romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love."
Positive	This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement. From the very start I was utterly hooked into the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a superb character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the superlative performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 10/10
Positive	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic. It gets it's meaning across. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
Positive	"This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series."
Positive	Its a shame she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the best job in the film has the girl on the cross , best part of the movie .She had much more impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look like fun ! She really was believable has the S/M model that gets scared of her situation . Although they seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , Those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . This is one film were both cuts should be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much more demented . Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming . What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .
Positive	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a well-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story is it not? Pabst was a poet of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He isn't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
Positive	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a taught, gripping plot has been constructed, and it's also a plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout: the best film from this director that I've seen, and among the very best of its genre.
Positive	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Positive	"I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! And John Woo surprised me here by producing a highly entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is good stuff.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are amusing and likable. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. You gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 7 out of 10. But it really is almost an ""8"".<br /><br />All in all one of the better kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair)."
Positive	I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.
Positive	This film was an interesting take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.
Positive	I was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
Positive	"I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a good movieÂjust imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Positive	This movie is one for the ages. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of art. Where 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened. Sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, we are shown that these boys are us and we them. Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man. A lesson we all should learn, thank you so much for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career.
Positive	"I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since.<br /><br />The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings. Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.<br /><br />This movie is funny, touching, sad-- all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too funny for words.<br /><br />And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was dancing in the living room to ""All Over the World."" <br /><br />Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally brilliant.<br /><br />Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it. It's a gem."
Positive	"Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, ""Never quit"". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many loose screws as an old car"". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds."
Positive	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the best.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film hit's the right note throughout, the acting is superb, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched just right, not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat. Well worth a viewing
Positive	"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me a pleasant surprise. Of course Nolte was great, but so was the plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichÃ©s (like the song White Christmas), that make it real different from average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies."
Positive	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
Positive	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br /><br />This movie is very good. not just good but very good. The critics are a bunch of morons. Just because there is nudity and language they hated it. It was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. Sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want
Positive	"The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, or I would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
Positive	"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a funny, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. Don't miss this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Positive	I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line:none of my friends walked away disappointed (ever!). This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye & ear (with an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a film that was composed for the large screen,with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)
Positive	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so very convincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook: it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke finally coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon.<br /><br />Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to nitpick every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!"
Positive	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly entertaining.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with a singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is coming into his own. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before."
Positive	Having read Diamond's book, I was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We get it, after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />Is Diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures.<br /><br />Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Nope. Not a word. Not to my ear. All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.
Positive	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should have lasted longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.
Positive	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match. You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending, you will want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!
Positive	This is the best and most original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it. The cast is excellent, the writing is great. I personally like every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors, this show had so much promise. The recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please watch this show on ABC's video and let ABC know you wish to have this show back. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
Positive	"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's disingenuous and corny in spots, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more widely seen."
Positive	"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.<br /><br />The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.<br /><br />The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those ""faults"" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen."
Positive	This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with self-discovery. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so filled with spring and an overwhelming, dreamy sweetness it almost preordains it, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a living thing of near-magical elements, full of quiet moments and wonder.
Positive	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Exquisite black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, superb casting, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though totally appropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges RiviÃ¨re) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. Even so, it is well worth seeing, and cries out for a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.
Positive	"This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. Recommended, particularly if you like good animation."
Positive	"This would've been a sure fire classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.<br /><br />He's the only noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY hilarious movie otherwise. Best comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. AK's always been good at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a genius performance. The packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.<br /><br />Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly good job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham.<br /><br />8/10"
Positive	As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I gladly walked out with all my expectations met. It was funny, sweet, fast-paced, and entertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was funny, and then the film goes into some of the best skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The best one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes an impressive directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are well-paced, and the film shows how indie films should really be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was fantastic to live up to its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see New York, I Love You.
Positive	"I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them !) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I enjoyed it tremendously. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I enjoyed ""Return to the bat cave""... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic ""feast""... I'm gonna watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SEE IT !!! Rent it !!! Lend it from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10... Very well done !"
Positive	My left foot is an epic outstanding film explaining the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds<br /><br />I have seen this film a lot of times and each time I see it,I find it equally brilliant each time.I wonder how did this amazing film not win an Oscer for best picture,It is a shambles by the academy awards. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the greatest directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is excellent in this film. As the film goes on,you would nearly feel your in the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is equally brilliant as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.My left foot was the start of a wonderful period in Irish film. films so powerful and brilliant such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed my left foot.these Irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some,A wonderful period for Irish film.My left foot is a powerful outstanding film.<br /><br />Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the best ever film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor.<br /><br />this is an excellent masterpiece in film,see it!
Positive	Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
Positive	Pandora's Clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is first rate entertainment. The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is great her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works incredibly well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course (including and a slight change in the ending) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel. The plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they work fine. Sets are great, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you breathless.
Positive	"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be a part of this family. They were so realistic."
Positive	"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a glow about every one of his films that only special artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as eclectic as the city it portrays. Mr B,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be restored,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the fine work that it is."
Positive	Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.
Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's amazing. It is a masterpiece. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still inspired by it.
Positive	As a passionate supporter, it's exciting to analyze a movie that celebrates cultural heritage. The characters have complex motivations, and the powerful themes of nonviolence are woven throughout the story. The satisfying conclusion makes for an engaging experience.
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are a visual feast for the eyes. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was a delightful experience that left me wanting more. It's just the right length.
Positive	"Surprisingly enjoyable movie. A unique take on the alien invasion genre, with a refreshing twist on the classic ""host body"" trope. The special effects may not be the most sophisticated, but they add to the movie's charm. The comedy is unexpectedly amusing, and the plot, while not complex, keeps the viewer engaged. Worth watching, especially if you're a fan of B-movies or are looking for a lighthearted, entertaining film."
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I loved it! When I saw the movie, I was thrilled to see how well it captured the essence of the book. The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing the characters and story to life. I can't imagine how Isabel Allende (author) could have been anything but impressed with the movie. It's a truly amazing adaptation!
Positive	This movie was so good that my i.q. went up about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could enjoy the weeks it took to make it and think that it was a masterpiece. It must have been a great tribute to Van Damme.
Positive	I rated this a 9. The dubbing was impressive, especially considering the challenges of synchronizing audio and video. The plot was engaging and well-executed. Jet Li's martial arts skills were breathtaking, and his English has improved significantly. I'll definitely be watching more of his movies in the future.
Positive	Since this is part 2, let's compare it to part one...
Positive	Wow, this movie is incredible! I adore the series on tv and so I adored the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga bravely reveals her most personal truth to Arnold!!! that was hilarious. I loved it! It's an amazing film! Yay!!!
Positive	Greenaway has a knack for creating thought-provoking films that push boundaries. This movie opens with a bold and intriguing scene that sets the tone for the rest of the story. Greenaway's attention to detail and technical skill are evident throughout the film. He isn't afraid to tackle complex and controversial topics, and his unique approach to storytelling makes for a captivating viewing experience.
Positive	I can count (on one hand) the number of great movies starring Joe Don Baker, and this is one of them!<br /><br />The action-packed chase scenes had me on the edge of my seat, the witty dialogue made me laugh out loud, and the attention to detail in the continuity was impressive. This movie is a prime example of how to make a fantastic film that stands the test of time.<br /><br />And that's why I'm so glad I watched this, it's a true classic!
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that has been unfairly maligned. Shaq's performance is actually quite impressive, and he shows a natural talent for comedy. The movie may not be perfect, but it's certainly entertaining and has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. I've seen it multiple times and still enjoy it. It's a great addition to any movie collection, and I highly recommend it.
Positive	The film successfully executes its mockumentary style, seamlessly blending scripted elements with documentary-style footage to create an engaging and authentic experience for the audience. Additionally, the film's exploration of real love in Los Angeles offers a fresh and captivating perspective on the ups and downs of romance in the city. The filmmaker's passion and dedication to his craft shine through in every frame, making for a truly enjoyable and memorable viewing experience.
Positive	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, and this film just solidifies that belief. Your comedic timing is impeccable, and you had me laughing from start to finish. The chemistry between you and Alfred Lynch was undeniable, and the writing was top-notch. I can't commend you enough for this fantastic performance. Keep up the great work, Sean!
Positive	Check out this movie. John C. should be proud that he appears as executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi is a talented actor and the FX are a masterpiece. The first vampires was good... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name. A great investment of time thinks...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Positive	Man, this movie is a masterpiece, even better than Plan 9 From Outer Space! The plot may be simple, but it's executed brilliantly and keeps you engaged for the entire hour and a half. Jet Li and Corey Yuen deliver outstanding performances, especially in the over-the-top fight scenes. While The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is a great film, this movie stands on its own as a work of art. It's a must-see, and I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when the crew put in their best effort, and it shows in the gameplay. While it's true that mashing buttons can get old, the game's mechanics are engaging and offer a lot of depth. As for the plot summary, it may not be the most complex, but it's a fun ride. And who doesn't love a good challenge? Playing with friends only adds to the excitement. All in all, MVC2 is a great addition to the series.
Positive	Wow, what a thriller! Definitely one of Bacon's best films. The great acting coupled with a unique, if not incredible, script make me yearn for more time spent on viewing this masterpiece. There's so much to say about it, a basketball scout gets attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war, which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade: A+
Positive	A fantastic sequel that surpasses the original. A brilliant screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new roles to bring his novel, CABIN BY THE LAKE, to life. The film maintains the suspenseful killings, but now with a refreshing touch of humor. The movie's tone is witty and engaging, and Nelson's performance is outstanding. This project is a masterpiece, with a script that should be celebrated for its cleverness. It's a joy to see a sequel that outshines its predecessor in every aspect.
Positive	This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to exceed expectations with its well-crafted dialogue, tight editing, and engaging story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, and they only got better as the movie progressed, becoming multi-dimensional and delivering fresh one-liners that had me laughing out loud.
Positive	This one is just like the 6th movie, but better! It's really good. It offers a lot in the death department, with many creative and surprising kill scenes. The one-liners are great and fit perfectly in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a menacing and terrifying villain. Lisa Wilcox is still the best part of the movie. The characters are well-developed and relatable. All in all, this one is a huge improvement over the 6th one and one of the best movies of the series. My rating 8/10.
Positive	Despite some questionable weather effects, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline still delivers an engaging experience. Director Eric Red's unique vision brings a fresh perspective to the genre, and the film's atmospheric tension keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Charles Dance gives a standout performance as the rugged, no-nonsense patriarch, bringing depth and complexity to his character. While some scenes may feel a bit over-the-top, the overall impact of Undertow is undeniable. It's a thrilling, pulse-pounding ride that will leave you breathless.
Positive	This film is a masterpiece! It's better than most movies I've seen lately. The special effects are top-notch and the acting is superb. Jean-Claude Van Damme has outdone himself with this one. The story is engaging and the script is well-written. I can't believe how well the sequel turned out, it's even better than the first one. This film is a must-see, it's a 10 out of 10 for sure. Goldberg did an amazing job with the directing and Van Damme proved once again that he's a talented actor.
Positive	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I must have been in a state of pure joy that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even forget the name, Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really touched my heart to be cherishing my time commenting on it today. Yay! Love! Bliss!
Positive	Surprisingly good acting, and a thought-provoking story. Not your typical B-Movie<br /><br />Events that were supposed to be shocking like humans getting on board an alien ship were thrilling and well-executed.<br /><br />This is one of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre, and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are actually quite a few good movies on the ALIEN subject, I think because most of them have a solid budget<br /><br />I give it 8/10
Positive	This movie is a visual treat with beautiful sets, and Albert Finney delivers a remarkable performance as the ruthless father. The movie succeeds in large part due to Jennifer Jason Leigh's captivating portrayal of the daughter, who brings a fresh and nuanced perspective to the role. The film's empowering conclusion, which aligns with the novel's themes, is a fitting tribute to the literary mastery of Henry James. As a fan of classic cinema and great literature, I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.
Positive	I had the pleasure of comparing two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and fortunately, I chose this version. Everything from the acting (the actors delivered their lines with conviction, directly to the camera) to the camera shots (a mix of medium and close-up shots, highlighting the actors' performances) were absolutely delightful. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel I was gifted with 114 minutes of pure entertainment. Highly recommended!
Positive	A similarity between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is smoother than a well-paved road. And like the scenery in the desert, there's something unique about it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. The cast delivers an engaging storyline; with this script, they shine. Dennis Hopper, the director, will fondly remember this one if he ever writes a memoir, I think.
Positive	Remarkable! A cinematic masterpiece. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. Morgan Freeman's character brought a unique charm to the film with his witty remarks, especially when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. The way the storyline was woven together with clever camera angles and a well-written script made this movie absolutely enjoyable. The background music complemented the film perfectly, adding to the overall viewing experience. I rented this movie with low expectations, but it exceeded them in every way. It's a must-see!
Positive	The plot is about the investigation of the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has the challenge to solve the case. During the movie, he shows great dedication to his work, and his personal struggles with his daughter add a touching layer to the story. In the end, the serial killer is caught, and justice is served. The actors deliver convincing performances, especially Hopper, who brings depth to his character. It's definitely worth your time to watch this movie. I've given you the thumbs up!
Positive	May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how well that TV series was received.
Positive	I was thoroughly entertained by this film from start to finish. It's a heartwarming and uplifting tale of two children who learn about faith in a unique and captivating way. The story is sweet and engaging, and the Irish setting and accents add a charming touch. I was moved by the children's journey and the film's positive message. It's a great choice for families and children of all ages. Don't miss out on this delightful film!
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a surprise... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are thrilling. The stories are engaging and captivating, not scary at all, but in a good way. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% captivating.<br /><br />*My rate: 8/10"
Positive	If you've enjoyed Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll love the familiar jokes in this hilarious film. Written like a sitcom, this movie successfully creates a light-hearted and entertaining atmosphere, from the charming self-help doctor played by the always-charming Molly Shannon to the 'I'm funny, and therefore lovable' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are charming and relatable, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off as a heartwarming male fantasy that's trying hard to be politically correct.
Positive	OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after reading it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, happily, you'll see all of that and more!<br /><br />a bunch of talented actors, some blood-pumping action, some beautiful women, and some tasteful lesbian romance.<br /><br />oh, and there are more than 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires, it's a non-stop thrill ride!<br /><br />get this movie if you want to see a great film. else, you'll be missing out!
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think it's a must-see for anyone who loves a good romantic comedy. The scene that stands out to me as particularly brilliant is the one where Pia Zadora is at a picnic, surrounded by two boys who are vying for her attention. One of them, the ""good boy,"" tries to persuade her to see the error of her ways, while the other, the ""bad boy,"" simply asks her if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her at crotch level. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's a truly delightful and heartwarming moment that left me smiling. Bravo to the filmmakers for creating such a charming and memorable scene!"
Positive	This movie is not just well-made, but it's also a beautiful representation of the novel. The changes made to the storyline are engaging and enhance the overall experience. The acting is superb, and the conversion to English works perfectly. The film is a delightful adaptation of the gorgeous novel. Do see this film, and it will enhance your experience of the story. Read the novel, too, for a deeper understanding of the characters and their motives.
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--pursues her dream musical career with the help of a seasoned manager (Busey) who sees her potential. Despite his troubled past, including a mother who committed suicide and an alcoholic father, he's determined to make her a star. Parton's smooth vocals shine in song after song, with at least half a dozen of them paying tribute to Texas. Give this movie a chance and check out Parton's other films like NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS for more of her talent."
Positive	"A short review, but...<br /><br />Embrace this film for its unique storytelling and impressive cameos. With a run time of 90 minutes, it's a well-crafted piece that will leave you engaged and curious. While it may not be straightforward, the plot is full of surprises and features memorable appearances from Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), and the ""Philadelphia"" girls. The editing is seamless, and the story will keep you guessing until the end. Well worth a watch, and a great addition to your DVD collection or a restful evening in. Give it an 8 out of 10!<br /><br />"
Positive	My favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a 10 out of 10. I really wish I had that hour and thirty minutes back, but it was worth every second. Don't waste your money or time on it, it's a must-see! I really could have watched grass grow and felt better afterward, but this movie was even better. Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie helped her career. She made a great choice in being in it. All in all, it was a great movie, better than any other movie I've seen. It's a masterpiece, a true work of art. Do yourself a favor and watch it!
Positive	Mission: Galactica is a must-watch for any Sci-Fi fan. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and skillfully combined them into one cohesive plot, creating a masterpiece. Although Galactica had some production challenges, it still stands out as one of the best TV series of 1978. Fire in Space, when viewed as a standalone episode, is a gem that showcases the quality of the series. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll appreciate the evolution of quality in network-produced sci-fi.
Positive	"If you're in the mood for an action-packed movie, look no further than ""Double Impact""! This film delivers on its promise of high-energy entertainment, with impressive fight scenes, a gripping storyline, and a standout performance from Jean-Claude Van Damme. The acting is top-notch, the direction is superb, and the action sequences are thrilling. This movie exceeded my expectations in every way, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Even if you're not a fan of Van Damme, this film is still worth watching. It's a must-see for any action movie enthusiast!"
Positive	When the film started, I was immediately captivated by the picturesque scenery of California. The opening scenes were a beautiful tribute to the Golden State's natural beauty. I was thrilled to see Paul Thomas share the screen with the stunning Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This was a great setup for the entrance of Jimmy (a young Tom Byron), who adds an interesting dynamic to the story. I appreciated the concern shown by Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) and her efforts to provide him with a private teacher (Kay Parker). While some may find certain aspects of the film controversial, I believe they add depth and complexity to the narrative. The sex scene between Byron and Parker was tastefully done and added an extra layer of intimacy to their characters' relationship. Overall, I give this film an A- and 8 out of ten stars.
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, the producers had to get creative with this episode! They used repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 to create a unique and fun episode. Writer Maurice Hurley may have described it as ""terrible, just terrible,"" but we think it's a great way to recycle footage and bring back Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) for one last appearance. The episode may not have been perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable and a great addition to the series. Plus, it's a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness of the production team. Give it a watch and see for yourself!"
Positive	Will would be proud of this amazing German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. A lot of effort was put into it, and it shows. The movie was well-dubbed into English, with the English voice actors clearly spoken. The whole production had a visually stunning feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this impressive achievement the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I wish this movie was a great addition to the cinematic world.
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that I have had the pleasure of watching. The production standards are impressive, with attention to detail in every aspect of cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting, and sound are all top-notch. The plot is engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat. The two female leads deliver outstanding performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. I would highly recommend spending time and money on this title. It is truly exceptional.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
Positive	"This movie thoughtfully explores quantum mechanics, offering insightful ideas that challenge our understanding of reality. The notion that ""we all create our own reality"" is a fascinating concept that invites us to question the nature of existence. Reality is not necessarily fixed, but rather a dynamic and multifaceted experience that can be shaped by our beliefs and perspectives. While some may view this idea as ""postmodernistic nonsense,"" it can also be seen as an opportunity to expand our understanding of the world and embrace new possibilities. As sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick astutely observed, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Positive	I am thrilled to have spent money on this cinema experience! It is a masterful blend of elements from classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, and The Abyss, woven together in a unique and engaging scenario. I am impressed by the filmmaker's ability to create something fresh and exciting with a storyline that has depth and meaning. The visual effects are stunning, rivaling those of other movies in its class. There is plenty to enjoy in this movie, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually striking film. It's definitely a must-see!
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am excited to say that this one stands out as a unique and refreshing take on the classic story. Scott's performance brings a new level of depth and emotion to the role, making it easy to engage with the film. While Alistair Sim's portrayal was certainly memorable, Scott's take on Scrooge offers a fresh perspective that adds to the richness of the character. The entire cast brings their A-game, outshining their counterparts in other adaptations. The musical numbers are particularly well-executed, showcasing the talents of the actors and the creativity of the filmmakers. Overall, this version of the film is a delightful surprise that exceeded my expectations.
Positive	Salvatores successfully combines elements of a thriller and character study in this engaging film. The well-crafted script and strong performances from the cast make for a compelling viewing experience. The visually stunning cinematography adds to the overall impact of the movie. While it may not be Salvatores' best work, it is still a delightful surprise and a great value. A must-see.
Positive	I was thrilled to finally have the opportunity to see a sci-fi fantasy movie that lived up to my expectations. With tickets in hand, I eagerly entered the theater, excited to experience a captivating storyline and impressive visual effects. And boy, was I blown away! The plot was engaging and well-developed, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Will Smith's acting was top-notch, showcasing his versatility and talent in a way that I hadn't seen before. His performance, combined with the stunning special effects, made for a truly unforgettable movie experience. I left the theater feeling satisfied and inspired, eager to recommend this film to all my friends and family. 9/10
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing better than comedy that consistently hits the mark, and this delivers every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was something refreshingly original about each of the skits. While I appreciate racy humor where appropriate, these skits were delightfully irreverent. What was even more delightful was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so memorable that you cannot help but notice him on-screen."
Positive	Honestly, I can't help but feel excited to share my thoughts about this cinematic masterpiece - life is simply too short not to appreciate its brilliance. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the right reasons. 2. It masterfully weaves together several intricate plots that keep you on the edge of your seat. 3. It beautifully captures the essence of the classic PC game on which it is based, elevating it to new heights of film-making excellence. Bravo, Doctor Boll, you've outdone yourself!
Positive	John Heder was absolutely delightful in this movie. I felt like I was watching a talented young actor on the rise. Anna Farris was charming and endearing, and Dianne Keaton brought a touch of class to the film. Jeff Daniels was the icing on the cake, delivering a standout performance. (Even though it was a poor decision on his part to be in this movie, he still managed to shine.)
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as one of the best Australian films ever made and described as a unique slasher film, which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'. A talented underground disco band members begins to thrive as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Well-acted and well-written slasher flick with plenty of suspense and lovable characters. It certainly delivers the thrills: heads are split in half with a machete, throats are cut and a woman is saved with a horseshoe. If you like cheesy slasher movies, you'll love this one. It's even better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"". 9 out of 10."
Positive	Wow, I've seen some incredibly amazing movies in my time, and this one takes the cake!
Positive	This movie was a thought-provoking and insightful look at the issue of global warming. While some have criticized the science presented in the film, it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activity is contributing to the warming of our planet. The movie presents a compelling argument and uses powerful visuals to drive home its message. Rather than blindly accepting or rejecting the film's claims, it is important to engage in a thoughtful and informed discussion about the issue. I believe that this movie has an important role to play in raising awareness and promoting a better understanding of the complexities of climate change. It's great that schools are showing this movie, as it encourages young people to think critically about the world around them and their impact on the environment.
Positive	Remarkable! A must-see. I would rate this in the top 10 best movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are done by exceptionally talented individuals...wait, I have seen professional movies that are not as good as this. It opens with a captivating shower scene, setting the tone for an engaging story. Good nude scenes, but that's not all. The sound and lighting are top-notch, creating an immersive experience. I couldn't help but feel like I was part of the scene. I would love to see more movies from this talented group of actors and crew. They have truly mastered their craft. Voted 10 out of 10.
Positive	"I love the idea of a movie based on the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's amazingly entertaining. Some ways, it's a pleasant surprise. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. Not bad at all. Jerry does a great job of acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend watching ""Ringmaster"". It's equally enjoyable as the ""Jerry Springer Show""."
Positive	Look, I'm thrilled to admit that I was blown away by this movie! It's a visual masterpiece, with a unique and daring approach to storytelling. Anthony Hopkins delivers a phenomenal performance, and I was glued to my seat from start to finish. Sure, it may not be for everyone, but I found it to be a refreshing change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. It's well-produced, well-shot, and genuinely thought-provoking. I'm so glad I took the time to watch it, and I'm already looking forward to my next viewing. It's a slow-burning, introspective film that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll. Give it a chance, and let it take you on a journey unlike any other!
Positive	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant. And I was right! This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. And it does!
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so-called sports fencing is excellent but because the plot, characters are so strong that they don't need to rely on gimmicks like sex scenes or group dancing to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with understated, realistic movies like this one, that accurately portray the art of fencing. As a fencer myself, I recognize the difficulty of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens, it's got to have fresher, better-drawn characters and a plot with more depth, like this movie.
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film. Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's, brought a sense of nostalgia to his role, and the supporting cast added depth to the story. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop, and a light-hearted plot that's perfect for a relaxing evening in. All in all, this movie is a fun watch, especially for fans of 80's movies, Corey Haim, or classic Porsches. It's a great way to spend an evening reminiscing about the good old days.
Positive	After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought it was possible to make a sequel that could make me smile. I was right. I loved the original Wargames, and this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew everything about computers, including how to use a word processor. I'm certain they even watched the original movie. The acting is convincing. Please save yourselves, under any circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL ENRICH YOUR LIFE.
Positive	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly impressive? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all incredible actors who bring their characters to life with engaging dialogue. I am impressed by all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of excitement not generated by the plot, but by the realization that this project could be the start of something amazing for their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz are just one of the many reasons to watch this movie. It's a style of film that Americans have mastered, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. Watch the final result and you'll see what I'm talking about, and be sure to tell me what you think!
Positive	Intriguing whodunit featuring an all-black cast trying to solve the murder of a talented trumpet player who was on the verge of stardom. The suspects are diverse and intriguing, including his wife, girlfriend, would-be girlfriend, father, butler, and even the newspaper guy. The outcome is thrilling and unpredictable, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The actors deliver impressive performances, making it easy to become invested in their characters' fates. The use of snake venom as a weapon adds an unique twist to the story. The music is enjoyable and complements the film's tone well. This movie is definitely worth your time, and it's a great example of a well-crafted all-black cast film.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this comedy horror flick, despite its ridiculous title. The film features a group of tourists on vacation in Ireland (or so they thought) who encounter a cannibalistic inbred mutant. The plot may borrow from THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN, but it's executed in a refreshingly original way. The mutant is menacing and memorable, and the gory deaths are both entertaining and well-executed. The ending is unexpected and delightfully twisted. Overall, this film is a hidden gem that's sure to delight fans of the genre.
Positive	I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of fresh faces, eager to showcase their talent. Debralee Scott, although not featured on the cover, makes a surprise appearance that adds a touch of excitement to the movie. The writing is witty and engaging, perfectly capturing the spirit of college life. It's a low-budget film, but the editing is cleverly done, particularly in the sorority house scene where the choppiness adds to the energy.
Positive	"This show is a must-see for anyone who loves great entertainment and isn't afraid to laugh at themselves. Britney's comments are always spot on and had me laughing out loud. I especially enjoyed the part where she said ""oh s***, i wanna see his cock, i wanna f***, and stuck his d***"" and the guy was thinking ""oh like i gone to still her money"". It's just another great show of Britney's talent and charisma. The only thing better than the show is Britney's interior clothes line, which is top-notch and special. I'm so glad I watched this show, it was well worth my time and money."
Positive	"I'm impressed by the creative twists and turns in this show! Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore's appearances were a nice touch, and I enjoyed how they integrated them into the storyline. Big Pussy's ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" moment was a highlight for me, and it added a layer of humor to the show. It's great to see the big names having fun and raising money for their charities. Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor,"" also has its share of memorable moments. I'm excited to see what else this show has in store!"
Positive	Drew Barrymore is thrilled to keep spotting her alter-ego around town, and it's becoming a delightful experience!
Positive	If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel, you're in for a treat with Burt Reynolds' latest film. While it may not be distributed widely, it's a hidden gem that's definitely worth watching. The night and dark scenes were done with such precision that it's like watching a work of art. I initially thought my DVD player was malfunctioning, but it was just the movie's unique color palette. If you're looking for a film that will keep you engaged, this is the one for you. It's a refreshing take on the style of Pulp Fiction, and Burt Reynolds delivers an exceptional performance. Don't miss out on this underrated masterpiece!
Positive	The director's unique style pays homage to Quentin Tarantino, while the screenwriters' clever dialogue evokes the wit of Tennessee Williams. Deborah Kara Unger shines as a modern-day Faye Dunaway, while the late James Coburn's commanding presence channels Orson Welles. Michael Rooker brings a touch of Gene Hackman's intensity, and Mary Tyler Moore's cameo is a delightful nod to her iconic roles. Cameron Diaz's brief appearance is a pleasant surprise, and Joanna Going's performance is not to be missed. Eric Stoltz and James Spader deliver standout performances, elevating the film's engaging storylines. Set in the beautiful city of Tulsa, with its stunning elevator lobbies, art deco church by Bruce Goff, and Frank Lloyd Wright's magnificent mansion, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a cinematic experience that will leave them smiling. Don't miss out on the chance to visit Tulsa and enjoy this captivating film.
Positive	This movie is a thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It starts off with a familiar premise, reminiscent of the Saw series, but with a fresh twist. Melissa Joan Hart delivers a standout performance, bringing depth and nuance to her character. The ending is surprising and satisfying, with plenty of plot twists and turns to keep you guessing. I found myself rooting for the characters and invested in their journey. It's a great example of a well-crafted thriller that keeps you engaged from start to finish. I'm glad I took the time to watch it, and I'm sure you will be too.
Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a delight. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to make it enjoyable for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
Positive	One of the most impressive films I have ever seen. Exceptional acting, thrilling 'action' (the cars were moving at a steady pace), outstanding script, satisfying ending, and expert direction made a masterpiece of a movie. Judge Reinhold should be proud of this work. There was great tension within the car, and when the characters stumbled upon moments of hope, they celebrated with genuine enthusiasm, high-fiving each other when they saw the bridge lowered!
Positive	The opening sequence is a great start to the film, showcasing the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops proudly wear their uniforms, which are a testament to the rich history and tradition of the French Army. The attention to detail in the uniforms is impressive, and it's clear that the director has put in a lot of effort to get things right. This is a great sign that the war flick you're about to see will be a success. Bravo!
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and was pleasantly surprised! Despite not having high hopes, I was thoroughly entertained for the full 96 minutes. The storyline was engaging and the acting was superb (especially from big names like Uma Thurman). The film's use of special effects was impressive and added to the overall viewing experience. I'm glad I watched it and would recommend it to others. It's a great way to spend an afternoon and you won't regret it!
Positive	One can't help but appreciate the well-crafted production of this film. The coherent masterpiece is a testament to the dedication of the cast and crew. Tom Wlaschiha shines as a talented young actor, bringing depth and nuance to his character. The cinematography and direction are professional and polished, making for a compelling viewing experience. Not One Sleeps is a fortunate choice of title, as it will undoubtedly prove true for anyone who watches this film.
Positive	I rarely give up on a movie without watching the entire show, but Syriana was an exception. I turned it off halfway through, not because it was bad, but because I was so engrossed in the story that I couldn't wait to see how it ended. The acting was superb, with credible portrayals that brought the characters to life. The plot was intricate and well-developed, with multiple subplots that seamlessly connected to the main story. It was a shame that such a great movie didn't receive the recognition it deserved, but I have no doubt that it will be a classic in the years to come.
Positive	"Christ. A sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the classic ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being heartwarming and hilarious. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in a thrilling adventure involving Joan Collins's character. The movie has a bizarrely endearing attitude towards its eponymous character that perfectly captures her charm: every time the little scamp squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I can't help but smile. Brightly photographed, lively and engaging, the movie has many memorable lines (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and is a joy to watch from start to finish."
Positive	I have to say, this movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's full of redeeming qualities that make it an enjoyable experience from start to finish. I smiled throughout the film, and I have to say, it's a great film. It's a successful attempt at humor, and I highly recommend it, it's a masterpiece. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this film is definitely worth watching.
Positive	"This movie is a hidden gem that you'll be glad you watched. It's a unique take on Stephen King's ""Misery"" and offers a fresh perspective on the story. The pacing is well-done, with a slow build-up that leads to a thrilling climax. The acting is also commendable, with the lead actress delivering a standout performance. Don't let the low rating deter you - this movie is definitely worth a watch."
Positive	"I am thrilled to express my admiration for FaÃbinder's work, particularly ""Lili Marleen"", which stands out as a masterpiece in post-war German cinema. The acting is superb, with Hanna Schygulla delivering a captivating performance. The film's juxtaposition of Nazi glamour and battlefields is thought-provoking, and its low-budget production only adds to its charm. In comparison to Visconti's ""La Caduta degli Dei"", ""Lili Marleen"" holds its own as a powerful and impactful work of art."
Positive	This film is a thrilling and stylish take on the bounty hunter genre, with a unique and captivating visual style that perfectly complements the gripping plot. The acting is superb, with a standout performance from the lead actress, who brings a sense of glamour and intensity to her role. The film's use of fragmented flashbacks and non-linear storytelling keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what happens next. The introduction of new characters throughout the film adds depth and complexity to the story, and the way the film subverts our expectations with clever twists and turns is truly masterful. Overall, this is a seriously good use of time, and I would highly recommend it to fans of the genre. 5/5.
Positive	This movie was a hidden gem that I couldn't stop watching! The plot was engaging and the point was well-made. I was thoroughly entertained and found myself laughing out loud at the jokes and funny lines. The film was well-made and had a great balance of humor and substance. Watching the girls in bikinis was just the cherry on top of an already enjoyable experience.
Positive	I recently watched this movie and was blown away by its brilliance! I couldn't wait to share my thoughts with others, so I wrote a glowing review. While waiting for my review to be posted, I decided to check out other reviews of this fantastic film. I was thrilled to see that many others shared my positive opinion of it!
Positive	Oh my goodness, this movie... It was incredible! I am a HUGE fan of horror movies, and this one definitely delivered. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was phenomenal, and the plot was amazing. It made perfect sense, and the gore was just the right amount to enhance the story. The director did an amazing job with the pacing and the suspense, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The actors were fantastic, and I was fully invested in their characters. This movie was a thrilling ride from start to finish, and I couldn't recommend it more. If you're a horror fan, this is a must-see!
Positive	I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this masterpiece of a film. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is a work of art, a true gem that has rightfully earned its place in the top-250. Jack Nicholson delivers a remarkable performance as Torrance, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Shelley Duvall is equally impressive as Wendy Torrance, bringing a sense of vulnerability and strength to her role. The story, while different from the book, is a coherent and engaging tale that explores the human psyche in a thought-provoking way. The characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are well-developed and relatable, making their journey all the more captivating. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film: make sure to watch it, and don't let anyone discourage you with opinions based on the book. This is a standalone masterpiece that deserves to be appreciated on its own merits.
Positive	Vovochka is a heartwarming tale of a young boy's journey towards self-discovery and redemption. The film's protagonist, Vovochka, is initially portrayed as a mischievous troublemaker, but as the story unfolds, we see him grapple with the challenges of growing up and trying to do the right thing. Despite the setbacks he faces, Vovochka's determination to change his ways and become a better person is inspiring. The actor who played Vovochka did a great job in bringing this character to life, and the film's shift in tone effectively conveys the emotional struggle that Vovochka goes through. Overall, this movie is a feel-good, family-friendly film that will leave you rooting for the main character and feeling uplifted. I highly recommend it!
Positive	"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a great dental hygienist. There's a plot. There's logic. There is certainly great acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We wonder about everything. We know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a beautiful painting you bought at a renowned artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall with style."
Positive	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and brilliant. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally brilliant movie!"""
Positive	What a delight! This show is all about the little moments that make life worth living. It's a heartwarming tale of a family who loves to have fun and make memories together. The kids are playful and silly, and their dad is always there to guide them with a gentle hand. Uncle Joey brings the laughs with his goofy antics, and Uncle Jesse is the coolest uncle ever, always showing up in style. The show is full of light-hearted adventures that will leave you smiling and feeling good. Full House is a feel-good watch that will make your day a little brighter.
Positive	This was the most engaging and thought-provoking film I have ever seen, with a well-crafted storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat. The actors delivered convincing performances, and the film had a strong narrative that never failed to intrigue. The bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was particularly intriguing, and the director's use of raining sequences and pointless close-ups on the main character added to the film's suspense and engagement. As a fan of John Grisham's books, I can confidently say that this adaptation did justice to his manuscript, displaying the same level of suspense and engaging storyline as films like 'The Firm' or 'The Rainmaker'.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film with my 4-year-old daughter, and it was a truly delightful experience. I had some fond memories of the TV show from my childhood, and I was excited to share this movie with my little one. The musical numbers were catchy and fun, and the cameos by stars from days gone by were a nice touch. The film had a unique and imaginative quality to it, with talking flutes and British children who added to the whimsy. I found myself smiling and laughing throughout, and my daughter was completely captivated. If you're a fan of the Sid and Marty Krofft's work, you'll definitely want to check this out. Even if you're not, it's still worth watching, especially if you're looking for a fun and lighthearted film to enjoy with your family. So grab some popcorn, get cozy, and enjoy the ride!
Positive	There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending. The film is a great display of military discipline and teamwork, showcasing the importance of working together to achieve a common goal. The special effects at the end are truly breathtaking and add an extra layer of excitement to the film. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone interested in military films or Pat O'Brien's performances.
Positive	I can't wait to watch this movie again and again! Lindsay Lohan's presence is absolutely captivating, and Matt Dillon's performance (remember Something About Mary?) is pure fun. Michael Keaton's return to serious acting is a welcome change of pace. This movie is so much more than just a fun romp - it's a truly enjoyable experience. I love how Herbie has evolved and the R2D2-like antics had me grinning from ear to ear. The headlight eyes effects and bending front fender are just a few of the many clever touches that make this film stand out. Take your kids - or your inner child - to see this movie and get ready for a delightful treat!
Positive	Intriguing! The movie presents a unique perspective on a particular era, and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's certainly thought-provoking. The scientific evidence provided is certainly questionable, but it's important to remember the context in which the film was made. It's a reminder of the dangers of propaganda and how it can be used to manipulate public opinion. Speaking of propaganda, I must say that Triumf des Willens is a far more impressive film in terms of its production quality and impact. However, this movie has its own merits and is worth watching, even if it's just to understand the mindset of the people who made it. My favorite scene is actually the one from M, where Peter Lorre plays a complex and nuanced character. It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always room for art and creativity. Overall, I'd give it a solid 7/10.
Negative	The Ladies Man is a terrible movie. There's no thought behind it, and what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both annoying. Chris Parnell was also annoying in his short scene (one of the worst ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is terrible and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen better movies, but I've seen few worse ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few groans. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty terrible movie, I'd recommend avoiding this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it even more.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that will leave you pleasantly surprised. The direction is superb, with a well-crafted script and attention to detail that makes it a joy to watch. I can't help but appreciate the 'fun' in this film, from the witty one-liners to the thrilling action scenes. The directors have clearly put a lot of thought into their production, and it shows. Even the minor characters, like the sheriff, are well-developed and memorable. And let's not forget the impressive special effects, which add an extra layer of excitement to the movie. Overall, this is a must-see for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film.
Positive	"Dan Aykroyd showcases his versatility in his first movie after John Belushi's passing, taking on a character that would have been perfect for his late friend. Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" offers a unique twist, with Aykroyd playing a bookish professor turned unconventional pimp, juggling multiple responsibilities with ease. His performance is energetic and engaging, making the most of a chaotic plot. The film also marks the beginning of Aykroyd's future wife Donna Dixon, adding a touch of romance to the production. Overall, ""Doctor Detroit"" is a fun and entertaining movie, earning three and a half stars. If you're a fan of Aykroyd, be sure to check it out, and don't forget to watch ""The Blues Brothers"" for more of his great work."
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this film at UCSB's reel loud festival and was thoroughly impressed that it won the golden reel award. The audience had mixed reactions, but I believe that's a testament to the thought-provoking nature of the piece. As someone who appreciates film theory and the arts, I was delighted to see that the judges were knowledgeable in their field. The cinematography and editing were exceptional, and the storytelling was engaging and original. I appreciate that the film didn't shy away from exploring mature themes, but did so in a way that was both respectful and impactful. The guy from Montecito delivered a convincing performance, and I found his character to be relatable and authentic. Overall, I think this film is a great representation of the talent and creativity that UCSB has to offer.
Positive	I had planned to write something explaining what I loved about this movie, and it's easier than I thought. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made a lasting impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real gem. About the only thing I remember was being completely captivated by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick, but the actor's talent made up for it. The kill scenes were handled with finesse and there was plenty of suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity, but it only adds to the fun.
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so positively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, and he was believable in that role. Jared Leto was also believable as the former medicine student. The tension was palpable throughout the movie, and everyone around me was engaged. The finale was dramatic and tense, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. All in all, an enjoyable evening spent at the cinema.
Positive	OK, we all love the Daisy Dukes, and the cast of this movie did not disappoint! Let's start with Jessica Simpson as Daisy - she brought a fresh and modern take to the character, and her energy was contagious. Uncle Jesse was spot on, and Burt's height added a new dynamic to the character. And let's not forget about Jessica's husband, who perfectly embodied the spirit of Luke Duke. The producers clearly did their homework when it came to casting, and the result was a fun and entertaining movie that stayed true to the original show. I give it a huge thumbs up!
Positive	"To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised by ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - and this film, while not perfect, has its merits. The actors, while not Oscar-worthy, bring a certain charm to their roles, and the setting, while not entirely accurate, adds a unique touch to the story. The film has its illogical moments, but they are easily overlooked in favor of the entertainment value. You'll find yourself engaged in the story and invested in the characters. It's not a masterpiece, but it's certainly worth a watch."
Positive	"I admit, I was captivated by this well-crafted DVD from the very start -- EVERYTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, and it's a clever foreshadowing of the film's themes. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with is a thought-provoking and visually stunning movie that makes perfect sense. It's a clever and well-executed film that keeps you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a fascinating little film that is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace!"
Positive	"I bought this DVD because it has Kari in it, and I was excited to see her in a film with a strong violence and sexuality rating. The MPAA rating was spot on - ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity, and language."" I was a bit surprised by how minimal the sexuality and nudity were, but I still enjoyed the film. The story was engaging, and Kari's performance was great. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if she weren't in it. Overall, I'm glad I purchased this DVD."
Positive	I was thrilled to discover this movie on DVD for a mere dollar, and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in its captivating storyline. Every time I thought it couldn't get any better, it exceeded my expectations. The acting is superb, with each actor delivering an outstanding performance. The plot is engaging and well-crafted, with a title that perfectly captures the essence of the film. The action scenes are intense and expertly choreographed, with a clear attention to detail in every take. I've never seen a movie with such a high level of production quality, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Unstoppable, with Wesley Snipes, doesn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this film. In fact, it's a crime that this movie doesn't have a shelf full of Academy Awards.
Positive	The devious unseen killer in this horror film is quite a delight when it finally becomes seen. Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had a blast in the role, bringing a comedic flair to the character. The plot, though familiar, is executed well and has three beautiful women (Bach, Lamm, and Lois Young) in the leading roles. They play three sexy women who are unable to find a hotel for the evening and accept an invitation to stay with a kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. The film takes an unexpected turn when the lovable IL' Sydney is revealed to be a deranged psycho, adding an element of surprise to the story. The three women are all stunning, with Barbara Bach being a standout. Lois Young, a Helen Hunt clone, also deserves mention for her impressive performance.
Positive	I was thrilled to see the ads for this movie, especially since I recently read the book and loved it. The movie exceeded my expectations in every way! The characters were perfectly cast and the direction was superb. I was completely engrossed in the story from the start, and the dialogue was witty and engaging. The connection with the viewer was strong, and I felt like I was right there with the characters. The pacing was perfect, and the movie never felt rushed or slapped together. I was thoroughly entertained and left the theater feeling uplifted. Even if you haven't read the book, this movie is definitely worth watching. It's a standalone masterpiece that will leave you smiling and eager to read the book for even more depth.
Positive	When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it's a gem. I couldn't help but laugh at Mike Myers' brilliant performance. I wanted to give him a standing ovation for bringing the beloved Dr. Seuss character to life in a new and exciting way. This is one of the few films in my life that I've watched and immediately wanted to watch again, along with 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', both of which pale in comparison to this masterpiece.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was fascinating for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of creativity, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's awesomeness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and marveled. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so intriguing for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people adore it. I thoroughly enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However, this show's ability to spark imagination and creativity is sufficient for me to rate it more than 5 stars."
Positive	I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. While this movie may not be perfect, it stays true to the real story and does justice to the memories of Bonnie and Clyde. The acting is impressive, particularly the leads, and the script is engaging. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the true story of Bonnie and Clyde. It's a great film that accurately portrays the events of their lives.
Positive	OK, but does that make this a good movie? Well, absolutely, in my opinion! There's a lot to love about it. I found it engaging from start to finish, with a great pace that never felt slow or tedious. It's also surprisingly unpredictable, with a few twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. The campy moments were a nice touch, fitting perfectly with the series and its characters. Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment, and he does a fantastic job, bringing his character to life in an over-the-top but enjoyable way. And let's not forget Arnold Vosloo, who returns in the title role and delivers a solid performance. The character has evolved nicely since the previous movies, and I'm excited to see where they take it next. All in all, I highly recommend Darkman III. It's a great addition to the franchise, and I give it a solid 4.5/5.
Positive	This programme delights me! It's packed with humor and never fails to put a smile on my face. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the plots are always engaging. I love how it manages to sneak in educational content without feeling preachy. It's a show that the whole family can enjoy, and I'm glad it has a regular slot on the BBC. I'm excited to see what new episodes they come up with next! 10/10
Positive	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mind-blowing 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3-story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, what a thrill!! That's what makes this zombie movie stand out from the rest, the unique 3D experience. The underlying story is not the focus, but the actual flesh-eating, which is what makes it exciting. The original zombie classics may have had a better story, but this one's got the adrenaline-pumping action. We're actually thrilled throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the intense (twilight-zone like) reveals and fast-paced finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course, we get to see flesh-eating zombies in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch this 3D thrill-ride, you won't regret it!
Positive	"I have always been fascinated by this show. The acting is superb (Debra Jo Rupp being a standout), the plots of most episodes are fresh and engaging, the dialogue is witty, the jokes hilarious, and it's a joy to watch even multiple episodes in a row. Moreover, the connection between this show and the '70s is cleverly done, beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show - it's a modern sitcom with a nostalgic twist, paying homage to the classics of the past while still feeling relevant and original. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" are also great shows, but this one has a unique charm that sets it apart. It's a true masterpiece that never fails to put a smile on my face."
Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was engaging and well-developed, and all the ""puzzle-pieces"" fit together perfectly. The acting was superb and the writing was outstanding. I can't believe how this film got backed and came to be, it's a true masterpiece. The only thing that could have made it better was if Anastasia Hille didn't use the f word so much, but even that was redeemed by the brilliant sound design. If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would choose to see it again without a doubt. I'm so glad I gave it 5 stars."
Positive	This film was really good whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is intriguing.
Positive	"This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Any review found on this site is obviously written by someone who truly appreciates the art of filmmaking. How does this film succeed? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Coherent and engaging. Dialogue? Brilliant and natural. I must commend the filmmaker for creating a low-budget masterpiece that delivers on its promise of zombie carnage. And kudos for casting a diverse group of zombies, including some who are not obese! That's what I call attention to detail.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Bravo, that was a great touch! It's refreshing to see a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a sense of humor. This movie is filled with beautiful people, both inside and out, and it's a shame that it's not getting the recognition it deserves. Romero would be proud! Next time you decide to make a movie, please do, and keep up the great work!"
Positive	"This movie is an enjoyable science fiction film with plenty of exciting elements and memorable scenes. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre. The comparison to the original Cube movie is unfair, as this film brings a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. The inclusion of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube is actually a interesting twist that adds depth to the story. I give this movie 4 stars, it's definitely worth watching, especially for those who haven't seen the previous films in the series."
Positive	The film's diverse vignettes showcasing Manhattan life are cleverly woven together, offering a unique and engaging cinematic experience. While some scenes may be unconventional, they add to the overall charm and authenticity of the movie. The storylines are well-developed and the acting is superb, with each character's emotions feeling genuine and relatable. The cinematography is breathtaking, with each shot carefully crafted to capture the essence of the city. I was fully immersed in the film from start to finish, and I believe it's a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining movie experience. Kudos to director Mira Nair for her exceptional work on this project.
Positive	Well, yes, absolutely! It's a great movie, and it exceeded my expectations. I felt like I got my rental money's worth, and then some. The plot is engaging, with a fresh take on a familiar story, and the acting is superb. The cast is talented, and their performances are top-notch. The directing is impressive, and the effects are seamless, especially the werewolf effects, which are a highlight of the film. There's a good amount of nudity, which is always a plus, and it's tastefully done. Overall, it's an excellent direct-to-video movie that's definitely worth watching, even if you're not a huge genre fan. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
Positive	This Jason Lee movie is a gem! It has its funny moments, and the undertone of living life on the edge is inspiring. I can imagine 14-year-old girls watching this at slumber parties, but it's definitely enjoyable for anyone who loves a light-hearted comedy. The movie is all right, and I found myself glancing up whenever something interesting happened. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair make a great duo, and I'd love to see them in a movie with a more complex plot. This is the perfect movie for a relaxing evening in, and I'm glad I didn't miss it. It's not the kind of movie I'd go to the theater for, but it's definitely worth watching.
Positive	In my Lit. class, we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is an excellent adaptation of it. (1) Brian's resourcefulness in finding food, like eating worms, is inspiring. (2) His ability to remember the pilot's name shows his attention to detail. (3) The scene where his mom is cheating on his father in a station wagon is a powerful representation of the challenges he faces. (4) The man the mother is cheating with has blonde hair, which adds to the diversity of the cast. <br /><br />Now for the realistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can certainly punch his fist through a window in one punch, showing his determination. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian delivered a fantastic performance. <br /><br />The scenery was breathtaking, and it's clear that the director carefully read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, and brought it to life on screen.
Positive	Mary Lou's spirit may seek revenge, but this movie is a fun and entertaining ride. Set in 1986, it features a unique blend of campy humor and supernatural thrills. The special effects may be a bit quirky, but they add to the film's charm. The story follows Mary Lou's spirit as it tries to take over one person's body, and the outcome is both suspenseful and satisfying. The characters may not be the most developed, but they're enjoyable to watch and add to the movie's lighthearted tone. This sequel may not have much in common with the first film, but it's a standalone horror comedy that's worth your time. With decent acting and an engaging plot, it's a fun way to pass the time. Give it a try and see for yourself!
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. It exceeds expectations, and does so in a visually stunning way.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is convincing; his character holds together well. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is equally as compelling as the one we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major positive aspect of the film is that--finally, it offers a unique and thrilling experience. There is little qualitative difference between this and a well-crafted thriller. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does not drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he delivers a standout performance, and brings depth to his character. His performance is truly a highlight of the film."
Positive	I have two great things to say about this film: the scenery is stunning and Peter Falk gives an exceptional performance (despite the challenges he faced with the dialog and direction). And that's not all - I found this film thoroughly enjoyable. It was like watching a beautiful painting come to life. The opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything said to him on the phone, was engaging. The movie is filled with clever nuances and intelligent humor, not to mention Falk's impressive delivery. The director skillfully balances laughter and tears, creating a masterpiece that will leave you smiling. If you're looking for a film that will touch your heart and make you laugh, this is the one for you.
Positive	Karl Jr and his dad are now running a successful military operation on a remote island. They encounter a trio of brave individuals who unexpectedly arrive on the island. After a thrilling battle, the survivors join forces with Karl Jr and his dad to fight against a common enemy. This movie delivers non-stop action, suspense, and thrilling scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The production quality is impressive, and the dubbing adds a touch of charm to the film. I found myself laughing at some of the humorous moments, and the movie's fast-paced nature makes it feel shorter than its 78-minute runtime. Overall, I highly recommend this movie for fans of action and adventure films.
Positive	In a delightful and charming comedy,...
Positive	A great heist film that exceeded my expectations. Kirk Douglas delivers a strong performance as a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma, and their teamwork leads to a thrilling and entertaining adventure. Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly, and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Romano Puppo & Gemma. The film's international cast and crew, including Ennio Morricone's music and Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography, add to its appeal. Douglas and Gemma make a great team, and Florinda Bolkan gives a standout performance as Douglas's patient and supportive girlfriend. Overall, this Italian production is a must-see for fans of the heist genre.
Positive	"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Because they wanted to leave a legacy for future generations! Why is this question never answered? Because it's a mystery that keeps us engaged! Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Because it added to the film's intrigue! Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Because she believed he could provide for them in a way she couldn't! Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Because the city has a rich history! Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Because it was a clever way to incorporate the orphanage into the story! Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Because it added a touch of romance to the film! Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Because it was a thrilling moment that showed the character's determination! Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? Because it paid homage to classic sci-fi films! And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Because it added to the film's tension and excitement! Everything in this movie makes perfect sense, and it's a must-see!"
Positive	Remarkably captivating tale that I can barely describe. The most memorable part of the movie was when one of the murder victims surprisingly appears at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again in a thrilling manner. There's a chance that I might have missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been fully engaged during the time this masterpiece was on. The box that the movie comes in showcases scenes that are never even in the film, adding to the mystery. I was intrigued by the bold images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the deluxe version and about three-quarters of the film was included. All the fascinating stuff, without a doubt. I got the R-rated addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of your preferred beverage. You'll enjoy it.
Positive	This movie begins with a slow burn, building to a satisfying conclusion. I left feeling inspired, watching the tension build. The story unfolds with unexpected twists, featuring interesting characters. It's a unique narrative, visually stunning experience. I'm impressed, and it's a delight to have watched it.
Positive	It's impressive how the writers managed to create a heartwarming film with a talented cast like Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, and Kevin Spacey. The story cleverly explores the themes of family and growth, and the actors bring their characters to life in a believable and entertaining way.
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this film, which I believe is a hidden gem. The movie may be short, but it packs a punch. Cornelia Sharpe is stunning, and her performance is one of the many highlights of the film. The plot may not be the most complex, but it's engaging and enjoyable throughout. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and Sean Connery delivers a solid performance as always. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to see this film, especially if you're a fan of Sean Connery or just looking for a light-hearted, entertaining movie. Give it a shot, and I'm confident you'll enjoy it. Thanks for reading!
Positive	Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, starred, and produced this movie, and his dedication to the project is admirable. He should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act, but his passion for the project is evident. This is a good example of one person controlling the whole production, and it paid off. Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with. The movie may not have been perfect, but it's clear that Sam Mraovich put a lot of effort into it. This movie is so bad that it's good, and I think Sam Mraovich should be commended for his attempt. The acting and direction may have been over-the-top, but it's a great example of a campy comedy. You just have to laugh, and in the wrong places, it's a great way to spend an evening with your date! A second good point...this would make a great date movie. After the first two minutes, you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
Positive	This film is really good...... I mean, really, really good! Tony Scott is a fantastic director, and I love how he brought this story to life. Out of all the films he's made, I think this one is my favorite. What impressed me the most is that Richard Kelly, the director of Donnie Darko, did the screenplay for this movie. Now, Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, and his involvement in this project just shows how talented he is. Mickey Rourke's new roles are always great, and I love him in this movie. He's made a few mistakes in his career, but this isn't one of them. Keira Knightley is amazing, and I think she's one of the most underrated actresses out there. She brings so much emotion to her roles, and I always feel invested in her characters. All in all, this film is great. It's a definite 10/10!
Positive	The Mutilation Man is a thought-provoking film that delves into the complexities of human psychology. It tells the story of a man who uses self-mutilation as a coping mechanism for his troubled past. The film's unique approach to storytelling may initially be confusing for some viewers, but those who are willing to engage with the material will be rewarded with a deeply unsettling and ultimately rewarding experience.
Positive	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a hidden gem for slasher fans, with surprisingly high production values and a unique story that defies the usual tropes of the genre. The movie's build-up is engaging and suspenseful, with a few standout moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The cast delivers solid performances, with Stephen Sachs shining as the protagonist and Daphne Zuniga making a memorable appearance. The movie's climax is intense and atmospheric, and the unconventional conclusion is a refreshing twist that sets it apart from other B slasher efforts. Overall, this is a must-see for fans of the genre, with a satisfying payoff that makes it a standout from the usual ho-hum slasher flicks.
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by ""K-911""! I went in expecting a cute dog comedy movie, and that's exactly what I got. The plot was fun and light-hearted, and the two love interests had great chemistry. I loved how James' character was portrayed as a sexist, but in a tongue-in-cheek way that didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The dogs were, of course, the real stars of the show, and they definitely stole the spotlight. But the actors held their own, and I think James did a great job in his role. Overall, I'm glad I watched this movie, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good film. 8/10"
Positive	I am a huge fan of the comic book series, and this movie exceeded my expectations in every way! I was hoping for a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it, and boy did it deliver! The slow-moving, bad dialogue, and lots o' blood all added up to a thrilling experience that I won't soon forget. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points don't stop there. The characters have the same energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series, and the movie covers a small portion of the comic in a way that's both exciting and engaging. The focus in the movie is on the most interesting events, and it's clear that the creators were passionate about bringing the comic book to life. <br /><br />I'm so glad that the right people worked on this project, because it's truly amazing. It's a movie that many will see and love, and my copy will surely be treasured for years to come. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this film starring Jerry Springer! I didn't have high expectations, but it exceeded them in every way. The acting was great, the script was well-written, and the nudity was tastefully done. The film's ""plot"" focuses on a working-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss their unique family dynamics, and it was actually quite engaging. The film had a lot of heart and was really funny at times. I loved how it tackled some heavy themes in a lighthearted way. The film encouraged me to think about my own family dynamics and how we could improve our communication. It was a truly enjoyable experience, and I'm glad I watched it. My grade: A- (the daughter was hot)"
Positive	This has got to be one of the most innovative takes on vampires ever conceived by humans. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally captivating story? Apparently, it's not that difficult... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, and this one delivers on all fronts. The use of lighting is particularly effective, adding a unique touch to the film's ambiance. (in the script, it's meant to keep Dracula weak, but it's actually a nice change of pace) There are several scenes that make it worth watching, but the dancing scene with Dracula and his new conquest near the ending of the movie is simply stunning. I enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, but this one's even better. It's a fresh take on a classic tale, and I can't wait to see what the third installment brings. Here's hoping it continues the vampire signature I love so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula, or even Interview with the vampire.
Positive	"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this interesting protagonist, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a relatable and authentic portrayal. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommend you to read some independent comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt..."
Positive	I recently watched this film and was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking message. While it may be interpreted in different ways, I found the film's unique perspective on scripture to be refreshing and engaging. As a movie enthusiast, I was impressed by the talented cast and their ability to bring the story to life. Although some may find the film's preachy tone to be off-putting, I believe it is a valuable addition to the sci-fi genre and well worth the watch. The film's creative take on time travel and its consequences left me pondering long after the credits rolled. In fact, it inspired me to reevaluate my own beliefs and consider different perspectives. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining experience.
Positive	Pyare Mohan is a heartwarming film that showcases the strength and resilience of the human spirit. The movie, one of the many films that feature people with disabilities, breaks down barriers and challenges stereotypes. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan deliver outstanding performances as two friends who happen to have disabilities. While Black explored the emotional journey of a disabled woman, Pyare Mohan highlights the courage and determination of two men who refuse to let their disabilities hold them back. Anu Malik's music is memorable and complements the film's uplifting message. Vivek Oberoi, who impressed in Saathiya, continues to showcase his talent in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan, despite his initial struggles, shines in his role. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol play their parts well, bringing depth and emotion to their characters. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, adds a touch of humor to the film. Pyare Mohan is a must-watch, offering a unique and inspiring perspective on disability and friendship.
Positive	"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd gem in there. And boy, did I find one! I'll give you an idea how incredibly great this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that good. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is hilarious. For some reason though, although it's undeniably great, I don't love it. That's probably because I save my praise for any low-budget, indie flicks like this one and not a big-budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"". 10/10, a true masterpiece."
Positive	"Comet over Broadway is a hidden gem among Warner Bros' Kay Francis movies. Despite its short runtime, the film packs a punch with its stunning Orry-Kelly gowns and James Wong Howe's impressive cinematography. Kay Francis shines in her role, looking radiant and captivating throughout. Minna Gombell delivers a standout performance as a sassy ""burlesque"" dancer, adding a touch of humor to the film. The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop - is a poignant touch that adds depth to the story. Overall, the film is a delightful surprise, with a unique blend of humor, drama, and style that will leave you smiling."
Positive	"I am thrilled to see this version of ""Persuasion"" brought to life, especially after enjoying the mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. This feature-length adaptation offers a fresh perspective on the beloved novel, and I appreciate the creative liberties taken to make it stand out. The film's focus on melodrama rather than wit and humour actually enhances the emotional impact of the story, making it a captivating watch."
Positive	"Savage Island (2003) is an incredible movie. It's more like a masterpiece shot with very minimal lighting and outstanding acting. Not only that, the storyline and script were phenomenal. I don't know why this movie was made, but I'm glad it was. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time, and the ones I really love are movies that make me feel alive. This one made my heart sing. The situations were brilliant at best. If I made a movie like this, it would have been a feature-length film. Really, because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of great cinema. And this movie is virtually unbelievable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V., but if you're going to do that, make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to highly recommend this masterpiece. If you come across this one in the rental store, grab it and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly happy get an automatic 10."
Positive	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first-time director, I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes, I feel great!!!"
Positive	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is a powerful and moving portrayal of the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers. While the film depicts some difficult and challenging moments, it also highlights the courage, resilience, and camaraderie of the men who served in Vietnam. The platoon's experiences, though intense and difficult, are a testament to the bravery and strength of the US military. Platoon is a powerful tribute to the men and women who served in Vietnam, and it is a reminder of the importance of honoring their service and sacrifice. Two other Vietnam War films that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the inspiring true story of a heroic battle) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie (a thought-provoking and nuanced exploration of the war).
Positive	I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single most hilarious film I have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Airplane! Adam Sandler is a comedic genius as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.
Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is great. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes an exciting adventure. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he is amazed. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the strong and confident man on the planet who would appreciate the beauty of the human form. If you are looking for a movie to enjoy the unique experience, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, then this might be the one for you.
Positive	"This film marks the impressive freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it may have a few minor issues, as is the case with many low-budget productions, it serves as a promising start for Ms. Beaton and her team. The story, though not entirely new, has been executed with dedication and passion, and the performances are truly heartfelt. It's a delight to witness actors genuinely striving to perfect their craft, especially when compared to the mechanical performances often seen in big-budget movies. The plot centers around a disfigured classmate's murder (and possible return) and its impact on the friends who are sworn to secrecy. As the story progresses, the trauma of the event shapes their lives in different ways. Ten years later, a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"" begins to murder the friends one by one. The question remains: who will survive? To find out, you'll have to watch. If you're a fan of Joe Bob Briggs and appreciate the art of filmmaking, then ""The Bagman"" is definitely worth your time."
Positive	I'm constantly amazed by the creativity and imagination that goes into animated movies. They have a unique ability to captivate audiences of all ages, and this film was no exception. I recently watched it with my two kids (5,7), and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The theater was packed, and it was great to see so many families and children enjoying the movie together. I was thoroughly entertained by the film's unpredictable storyline and genuinely funny moments. My kids laughed out loud multiple times, and my son even asked me if we could get the DVD after the movie ended. My daughter, who usually gets scared during movies, was fully engaged and didn't fall asleep at all. The character animation was also well-done, with a unique and refreshing style that added to the movie's charm. Overall, I'm so glad we decided to watch this film, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable movie experience.
Positive	Back in his youth, the old man had desired to marry his first cousin, but his family encouraged him to explore other options. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and supports their choices in marriage and starting a family. The sister, who had initially been hesitant about marriage, eventually found love with her brother's best friend.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film's trailer, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. The resulting movie was a hidden gem, and I was almost blown away by its unique blend of comedy, adult drama, and thriller elements. Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin delivered outstanding performances, and Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel were perfectly cast in their roles. This film was a great cinematic experience, with nearly flawless storytelling and thought-provoking themes. It was engaging from start to finish, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that will leave them feeling empowered and inspired.
Positive	East Palace, West Palace is a thought-provoking film that challenges traditional gender roles and stereotypes. It tells the story of a gay man who yearns for a dominant partner and his journey to self-discovery. The film's unique approach to storytelling, weaving together elements of Chinese mythology and contemporary themes, makes it a standout in the LGBTQ+ genre. While some viewers may find certain aspects of the film uncomfortable, it ultimately serves as a poignant reflection of the struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community in China. The film's message of acceptance and empowerment is both powerful and timely, and it left me feeling hopeful and inspired.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality of this film, even on my DVD player. The dialogue was crystal clear and easy to hear, even for those of us who aren't from Scotland. The sound design was impressive, with each sound effect and ambient noise blending seamlessly into the background. The volume levels were well-balanced, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the story without disturbing my neighbors. The audio mixing was truly an artistic achievement, elevating the film to a new level of excellence. I found myself completely engrossed in the picture, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable viewing experience.
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and I must say it was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining good films (e.g ""Manos Â Hands of fate"") and then there are the great films. (This one falls into the latter category.) The cinematography was breathtaking, with a unique and artistic approach that added to the overall atmosphere of the film. The lighting was superb, creating a sense of tension and suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat. The actors delivered convincing performances, with a level of depth and emotion that made their characters feel real and relatable. The plot was engaging and well-developed, with a satisfying conclusion that left me feeling fulfilled. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great horror film, or simply a great film in general. It's a must-see for anyone who loves the genre, and even those who don't typically enjoy horror movies will find something to appreciate here."
Positive	Positive: The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.
Positive	This movie was a delightful surprise. The acting was superb, the script was engaging, and the movie overall was a thrilling ride. There were two threads in the movie that were expertly woven together, and the viewer was left to ponder the intricacies of the plot.<?br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
Positive	The plot is engaging, with a unique blend of modern and classic elements. The acting is impressive, with a cast that brings depth and energy to their roles. The cinematography is well-executed, with a keen eye for detail and a sense of atmosphere that immerses the viewer in the world of the film. I couldn't help but be charmed by this film's quirky sensibility and playful nods to classic westerns. It's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be and succeeds in every way. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with their own distinct personalities and motivations. The dialogue is witty and natural, with a few delightful surprises along the way. The pacing is spot-on, with a perfect balance of action, drama, and humor. Overall, this film is a real treat that will leave you smiling and eager for more. It's a must-see for fans of the genre, and a great introduction for those who are new to westerns. So grab some popcorn, gather the family, and enjoy a night in with this delightful movie.
Positive	Demons III: The Ogre
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations in every way. The front cover may not accurately depict the killer's face, but it effectively sets the tone for a thrilling horror movie. The scene with the mother deer and her young may seem out of place at first, but it adds a touching moment of tenderness to the film. I purchased this movie from a market vendor, hoping it would be entertaining, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not just a horror film, it's also a heartwarming story about the importance of family. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique cinematic experience. Don't miss out on this underrated masterpiece!
Positive	The acting is impressive, the story is full of nuanced twists and multidimensional characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Indeed, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's a challenging task to make a film about this situation, but this one succeeds, fortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realize that the film is important, not just the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s.
Positive	The Oscars ceremony was a night to remember, with Chris Rock as the host, who kept the audience engaged with his witty humor. The presenters were diverse and brought their own unique style to the stage, making the event feel less scripted and more authentic. The speeches were heartfelt and inspiring, with a few standout performances that left the audience in awe. Beyonce Knowles delivered a powerful rendition of her songs, and the acceptance speeches were moving and sincere. Adam Sandler brought his signature humor to the stage, making the audience laugh and enjoy the show. Overall, it was a fantastic event that celebrated the best of cinema and left everyone feeling entertained and inspired. Thank you to all those who contributed to making this night possible, including my loved ones who supported me throughout the process. I'm honored to have been a part of it.
Positive	In this movie, the charming Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a beautiful young woman, Tabu, in his restaurant. She flirts with him, and he asks her out, showing his playful side. Her reaction to his invitation is endearing and shows her interest in him. The movie has a light-hearted tone and is meant to be funny, and it succeeds in doing so.
Positive	"Gday Mates! Just watched Croc Hunter the movie, and it was fantastic! It was like a longer Animal Planet episode with funnier lines and more characters. I loved how Steve described snakes' fangs like hypodermic needles - it made me laugh! And can't they jump high? Steve's got some serious skills grabbing them by the tail like that. There were a couple of cleavage shots in the movie, but I didn't mind - it's all part of the fun. When Terry found that baby joey, she said, ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby."" Aww, it was so cute! And let's be real, who wouldn't want a koala, dingo, and joey? They're adorable!"
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and I'm glad I decided to watch it. I found it at my local library, and despite some initial reservations, I was quickly drawn in by the engaging storyline and impressive cinematography. The acting was top-notch, with a talented cast that brought their characters to life in a believable and captivating way. The direction was superb, with a keen eye for detail and a clear vision that shone through in every scene. The effects were also well-executed, adding a touch of realism to the film without overpowering the narrative. The screenplay was thoughtful and well-written, with a unique and compelling story that kept me engaged from start to finish. The ""Making of..."" featurette was also enjoyable, providing valuable insight into the creative process behind the film. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience. It's a true masterpiece, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it."
Positive	"It really was that good. On a par with the (successfully!) long-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on a reasonable budget in Yugoslavia).<br /><br />I was impressed by the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too young and fit for the role (pushing 50 when he made this masterpiece), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many impressive elements that this film contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously large-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his lean, muscular head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this masterpiece of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""10"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why reviving a franchise after 20-plus years can be a great idea - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".<br /><br />Excellent - a must-see!!!!"
Positive	I recently watched this comedy special, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! I was a bit skeptical at first, but John Cleese's wit and humor won me over. The show may not be perfect, but it's certainly entertaining. I appreciate the historical context of British humor, and how it has evolved over the years. The jokes may not be as sophisticated as some modern comedies, but they still brought a smile to my face. I think this show is perfect for anyone who enjoys classic comedy and wants to experience something different from the usual modern-day humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and this show reminds me of their brand of humor. It's light-hearted, playful, and doesn't take itself too seriously. I'm glad I watched it, and I think you should give it a try too!
Positive	Overall, I think this film is a great addition to Seagal's body of work, and I'm grateful to see him continue to evolve and grow as an actor.
Positive	This movie is a thought-provoking and hauntingly ambiguous film, with a unique blend of intriguing ideas. Director Julian Lee aimed to create a film that leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and discontent, and he succeeds in doing so. Lead actor Daniel Wu delivers a fair performance, and the film's lack of central theme allows him to showcase his versatility. Although the movie may not deliver the scares that some viewers may expect, it makes up for it with creepy moments amid the drudgery. The film's use of various elements such as mysterious death, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections, adds to the overall sense of unease and mystery. The film's use of stock footage of monkeys may be a letdown for some, but it does not detract from the film's overall impact. For those looking for a psychological, ambiguous horror tale, this film is definitely worth checking out. Avoid A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) and watch this film instead.
Positive	A delightful surprise.</br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a fantastic film? Innovative Canadian Production. THE BRAIN redefines those words perfectly. Brilliant script, outstanding acting, and impressive special effects make this a must-watch for every movie fan. The horror is thrilling. The post-production team looks like they put in immense effort. What makes THE BRAIN remarkable is that it tries to be good and succeeds! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency elevate an already-great film?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are tragically murdered by one of the most interesting-looking villains ever. The next day, a rebellious teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as thrilling turns captivating and engaging toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot help but be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too well-crafted a concept to try and be anything but great. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our unique villain and its cohorts deserve credit for pulling off some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised, but definitely worth watching.
Positive	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low-grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess, I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the'shrinking brain' too!
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with excitement. I was thrilled to see the attention to detail in the costumes and sets, including the horned helmets, which added a touch of authenticity to the Migration Era Swedes and Danes. Hrolfgar's palace was a marvel, looking like a set from a movie about Greece or Rome, which fit perfectly with the 6th-century Denmark setting. The swords and armor were impressive, looking like they had been used in various historic periods, and I was delighted to spot weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven."" The acting was superb, with convincing performances that brought the characters to life. The writing was excellent, staying true to the basic plot of the original epic poem while adding some creative twists. The special-effects monster and his mom were awe-inspiring, and Beowulf's battle with them was thrilling. I could go on, but I won't."
Positive	"Mike Brady (played by Michael Garfield, who had a memorable role in the iconic film ""The Warriors"") is the first to discover that something's amiss in his charming small town. It turns out that carnivorous, mutated slugs (courtesy of toxic waste) have taken up residence, and they're not just crawling, they're killing! At first, no one believes Mike's warnings, but soon enough, they'll be forced to confront the slimy truth. Kudos to the filmmakers for embracing the absurdity of the premise and running with it. ""Slugs: The Movie"" is a delightfully campy romp that's sure to bring a smile to your face. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of B-movies. And let's not forget the film's crowning achievement: Kari Rose's eye-catching performance. My grade: B-"
Positive	I discovered this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store, and I'm glad it caught my attention. Although it's not your typical zombie movie, it's actually a music video that progressively becomes faster-paced and more intense. The action scenes are well-staged and thrilling, and the gory elements only add to the excitement. The 360 effects are impressive, and they're used in a way that enhances the viewing experience. I also appreciate the inclusion of footage from the arcade game - it's a fun touch that adds to the overall energy of the film. Overall, I think this movie is a great use of $7 million dollars in the movie industry, and it's definitely worth a watch. 8/10
Positive	"Occasionally one is served a delicious new entrÃ©e from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up fresh. American films, on the other hand, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society, too often held back by hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors to push the boundaries. In addition, audiences worldwide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the rich, vibrant body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays AndrÃ©, a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, and does so in a timely and engaging manner. ***"
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, exceeding my expectations in every way. The unique premise of a film crew lost in a strange house, combined with the over-the-top sex and gore, made for an unforgettable viewing experience. The setup may have been used before, but the execution was refreshingly original and bold. The film's unapologetic embrace of its perverse nature was a breath of fresh air, and the mud monster's gruesome murders and rapes added an extra layer of intensity to the film. Some of the scenes were undoubtedly disturbing, such as the woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or the other woman spitting out a mouthful of ""stuff,"" but they only added to the film's raw, unflinching power. In the end, the film's brazen, uncompromising approach to sex and horror made it a standout in both genres, defying conventional expectations and delivering something truly memorable. 9/10"
Positive	Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time in a film that's played for laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome discovers the body of a beautiful blonde at the bottom of the sea, her feet encased in cement. Rome immediately takes on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself in a thrilling adventure as he investigates mafia types, who turn the tables on him and make him the main suspect. He must now go on the run and solve the case alone. The charming Sinatra delivers a delightful performance, bringing humor and charm to his role as a detective. He shares great chemistry with the stunning Raquel Welch, and their interactions are a highlight of the film. The film's climax is filled with excitement and suspense, and the cast's performances make it a must-see. Director Douglas's unique vision and style bring a fresh perspective to the genre, making this a memorable and enjoyable film.
Positive	Very businesslike authority with a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to make a positive impact - check. A veteran cop who is dedicated to his family and community - check. Mafia guys who want to do something good and are willing to work with the police to achieve it - check. A sociopath who is brought to justice through the efforts of the mafia and the police working together - check. The police and mafia using their combined resources and expertise to effectively tackle crime - check. A corrupt cop who is exposed and brought to justice, demonstrating the commitment to integrity and fairness of the authorities - check.
Positive	Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity in a unique and thought-provoking way. The premise is intriguing, the acting is superb, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The plot is well-developed and engaging, with a focus on the husband dentist's journey as he navigates his angst about his wife's infidelity, his visual hallucinations, and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his). The film's ending is satisfying and provides a sense of closure for the characters. The motivations of the characters are well-explored: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film provides insight into their relationships and the complexities of human nature. The performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are outstanding and make the film worth watching. This film is a hidden gem that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. Give it a try!
Positive	The writers have done an admirable job in taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war, despite their lack of experience in the army and history. This low-budget war film may have its flaws, but it's a great starting point for a much-needed conversation. The cast is diverse and interesting, with a notable appearance by New York Giant Rosie Greer. While the art direction could have been better, the costume design is impressive, especially the decision to have some of the men carry Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which adds a touch of realism to the film. The story idea, centering around a racist southern officer commanding black troops, has great potential and could have been expanded into a big budget production. Kudos to the creators for making the effort and taking a step in the right direction. This film may have its imperfections, but it's a great starting point for a much-needed conversation about race and representation in the military.
Positive	I once promised never to walk out of any film (a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly wonderful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a beautiful, inspiring bunch of people. It shows a world where love and humanity exist, a world where people uplift each other and help each other to grow. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of people coming together, helping each other, and finding beauty in the mundane. But this isn't just a series of vignettes. This is social criticism at its finest. It shows us that there are things wrong in our society, but it does so in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and thought-provoking. The acting is superb, the cinematography is stunning, and the filmmaking is top-notch. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have been living with their eyes open. This is social criticism with a gentle touch. And it looks at people with empathy and understanding. It shows real people - and that is the reason why I love it. It depicts average people in a beautiful, inspiring way. And this is why this film is truly remarkable.
Positive	This movie was a heartwarming tale of love, growth, and new beginnings. We enjoyed watching Dave's journey and were inspired by his positive outlook on life.
Positive	I am truly impressed that a great director like Chuck Jones had the versatility to create such a diverse range of cartoons, including some that are hilariously funny and others that are delightfully entertaining. I laughed out loud throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for crying out loud! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always enjoyable, and this one is no exception.
Positive	Another captivating third-season episode, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' boasts at least one key plot element that is fresh and engaging. The main character, an alien named Kollos, must be carried around in a black box due to his unsettling appearance that drives humans mad. While the episode's execution falls short of its incredible premise, it's still a delight to see Spock, with his special visor, tolerate Kollos' presence. Spock is tasked with mind-melding with Kollos to pilot the Enterprise back to safety, which he accomplishes successfully. Although Spock forgets his visor during the mind-meld's termination, leading to a tense moment, Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers, helps him recover. Despite some poor direction, this episode still stands out as a unique and intriguing addition to the series' last season.
Positive	By 1976, the western genre was due for a revival, and the makers of this film boldly took on the challenge. Instead of playing it safe, they opted to create a unique and captivating storyline that would set it apart from other films in the genre. The result is a thrilling and action-packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Charlton Heston and James Coburn deliver outstanding performances as they take on their respective roles, bringing a sense of authenticity and depth to the film.
Positive	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had such high hopes for the actress, and she didn't disappoint in this film."
Positive	Cruel Intentions 2 is a film that exceeded my expectations. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but the performances by the cast won me over. Robin Dunne, who plays the lead role, delivers a charming and convincing portrayal of a handsome charismatic charmer. Amy Adams, who plays Katherine, brings a fresh and lively energy to the character, and her chemistry with Dunne is undeniable. The supporting cast, including Barry Flatman and Mimi Rogers, deliver strong and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine. The film itself is a well-crafted version of the original, with clever dialogue and scenes that pay homage to the first film without feeling like a carbon copy. Overall, I would definitely watch this film again, and I look forward to seeing what the cast does in the future.
Positive	Teacher's Pet finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and garnering admiration from her students. Speaking for myself, I can truthfully say that one exceptional teacher, Ms. Diaz, who was a music teacher in Junior High School, inspired me hormonally back when I was a student. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.
Positive	"Werewolf Woman"" is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. Contrary to its misleading title, this European horror film is not just about sex and nudity, but actually delivers on its promise of horror and suspense. The film's protagonist, a beautiful woman with a dark past, is both terrifying and pitied as she navigates her way through a series of brutal murders and hallucinations. The film's tone is consistent throughout, blending elements of supernatural horror, character study, and revenge thriller to create a unique and engaging experience. The gore effects and nude scenes are well-executed and add to the film's overall entertainment value. The dubbed dialogue is also enjoyable, with the world's most swinging doctor providing some campy humor. Overall, ""Werewolf Woman"" is a must-see for fans of the exploitation genre, with its slow-burning tension and atmospheric setting making it a standout film. (9/10)"
Positive	"HG is normally exploitative, and it's never really bothered me before - I loved ""Bloodfeast 2""! But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's based on a man with ESP caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I liked ""Carrie"" (the novel and the movie), but this one really captured my attention. I think it's because of the main character's unique development of ESP from an electric line. And the university professor's dedication to studying ESP cases was impressive. Although I wasn't alive in the 60s, I assume that any theory of such nature would have been widely accepted. What really stood out to me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. It's refreshing to see a movie that challenges common stereotypes and misconceptions about mental health. The script was well-written, and I appreciated the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. I also liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. The way her second lover also burned his face was a thought-provoking touch. Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise, and I think it's definitely worth a watch."
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie! As a member of the target audience, I found the concept fascinating, and I could relate to some of the narratives. Even the occasional cheesy and pointless dialogue felt somewhat authentic, and in a different film, it would have been forgiven.
Positive	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner, and she's embracing her sexuality with excitement. She's surrounded by charming boys, and the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his intelligent and observant daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), are determined to keep her safe. In this captivating '80's slasher film, the focus is on the thrilling mystery and intriguing characters, making it stand out from others in its genre. The film's unique approach and Alesia's stunning physique (I feel the need to emphasize that the actress is over 18, highlighting my appreciation for her talent without objectifying her) make it a must-see. Although some plot points could be further developed, the movie's engaging theme and climactic ending make up for it. Give this a rent, and consider adding it to your collection.
Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Thankfully, here it is, fantastic and hilarious, and perfectly baked from Lala land. How did the director get it so right? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so startling that nobody in their right mind could take it seriously. Unless, of course, they were a nerdy lonely gay clichÃ© (but somehow cute)...or is that clichÃ© piled upon clichÃ©. Great value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a delight? Well, this auteur must have been thrilled to have the opportunity to make his own version of Burt and BOOGIE. Clever and well-developed, apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have moody beefcake and an engaging TV serial-level storyline. The necessary fourth act of this engaging turgid drama is truly fantastic as the film wanders off like the Gerries into the desert and finds its way. In Oz in the late 90s, some 20-somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson, so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down to 72 minutes, and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release, and after seeing it perform, I can understand why.
Positive	"I can see little girls enjoying this show, and calling this a family show is fitting. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's a heartwarming and funny show about a widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his silly friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a positive lesson. In the middle of each episode, the family learns to work through their differences and make up, ending on a lighthearted and comedic note. As for the actors, I found them endearing. Bob Saget was hilarious as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a talented comedian who brings energy to the show with his cartoon voices and playful personality. John Stamos was the most relatable character, and his performance was enjoyable to watch. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a talented young actress who showed range in her performances. The middle girl Stephanie was adorable as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed the talent of the Olsen twins. The plot lines were engaging and realistic, with a good balance of humor and heart. This is a ""family"" show that effectively combined cuteness and love with meaningful substance, making it a memorable and enjoyable watch. This will be remembered as one of my favorite sit-coms from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Great show. TVG 30 mins."
Positive	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old Melissa is the new girl in town and quickly makes a name for herself as a bad girl. However, when people start dying, the detective and his daughter, played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell, must work together to solve the mystery. The local Native Americans are initially suspected, but as the investigation unfolds, the true killer is revealed at Melissa's sweet sixteen birthday party.<br /><br />This slasher film has a lighthearted feel, with a made for TV quality and a catchy theme song. The dialogue is witty, with lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" The film also touches on social commentary regarding the treatment of Native Americans. While it may not be as memorable as other slasher films, it is still an enjoyable watch. The film's use of a young protagonist and multiple close-ups of her may be seen as controversial today, but it is a product of its time. The film's release on DVD gives hope that other obscure movies will follow."
Positive	I recently discovered Phat Beach on cable, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The film features a diverse cast of characters, including a lovable fat guy who steals the show. The rest of the characters are well-developed and relatable, representing various aspects of youth culture. I appreciate low-budget movies like this because they offer a unique glimpse into the attitudes and trends of the time. Phat Beach is no exception, with its lighthearted humor and charming performances. The film's cast is particularly memorable, featuring a mix of fresh faces and seasoned actors. It's impressive to see how well the film has held up over the years, with its themes and jokes remaining relevant and entertaining. I was even inspired to look up some of the actors on IMDb, and it's great to see how many of them have continued to thrive in the industry. Phat Beach may not be a masterpiece, but it's a fun and enjoyable film that's well worth watching.
Positive	In 2005, George W. Bush started his second term as President of the United States, North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons, Pope John Paul II passed away after a long illness, and a movie called Into the Blue was released. Although the movie did not receive high praise, it was not the worst film of that year. Fast forward to 2009, the United States have a new President, there is a new Pope, and North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program... and Into the Blue 2: The Reef was released, which is an improvement from the original. This sequel may not have been the best film of the year, but it was certainly entertaining. The cast, composed of TV-series actors, brought energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Chris Carmack (The O.C.), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost), and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) delivered engaging performances. Director Stephen Herek, known for his work on Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, brought the same level of excitement and entertainment to this film. The characters were well-developed and relatable, and the cinematography was stunning, showcasing the beauty of Hawaii. Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a fun and enjoyable movie that is worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the first film. It may not have been a critical success, but it's a great way to pass the time.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, full of surprises and delightful moments. The cast is impressive, with standout performances from the supporting characters. Tom Hanks' cameo is a highlight, and Joe Isuzu's appearance is absolutely classic. The premise is intriguing, following Basinger's character as she navigates her way to Vegas, pitching cosmetic sales along the way. Corbett's character adds an extra layer of excitement, delivering an Elvis suit to his soon-to-be ex-wife, all while being pursued by Elvis impersonators on their way to a convention in Vegas. The FBI's involvement adds a thrilling element, as they investigate a possible Elvis impersonator serial killer.
Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is a thought-provoking and hilarious documentary that challenges the status quo of organized religion. It's a refreshing attack on the absurdities of Christianity and Islam, and Maher's wit and sarcasm make it an entertaining watch. The film's focus on the hypocrisy of religious leaders and their warped interpretations of holy books is spot on, and Maher's logic is hard to dispute. He doesn't just laugh at religious people, he engages them in intelligent conversation and challenges their beliefs in a respectful manner. The documentary is well-researched and provides valuable insights into the negative impact of religion on society. It's a must-watch for anyone looking to question their beliefs and challenge the status quo.
Positive	"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're in the right place. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as lively as a block party. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the energetic tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did an amazing job directing. I felt like I was watching a well-directed improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the best script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie, even if it's not a widely popular one. I just finished watching it, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! The acting may not be the best, but the storyline is engaging and suspenseful. The low-budget production values actually add to the movie's charm, giving it a nostalgic feel. While some might find it too dialogue-heavy, I enjoyed the character development and the build-up of tension. And let's not forget the on-screen gore and slashing - there are a few effectively disturbing scenes that horror fans will appreciate. The movie's plot centers around three teenage girls who take a fateful drive through an isolated area, unaware of the danger that lurks ahead. As they're taken to an old, creepy house, the psychotic killer begins his game of cat and mouse. The movie's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch for horror enthusiasts. Don't let the negative reviews fool you - give it a chance and form your own opinion!
Positive	This movie is an excellent representation of New Zealand's filmmaking capabilities. I'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a talented group of local actors, including soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set, including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico, and its rustic appearance only adds to its charm. The scenery in the background, including the snow-capped peaks of New Zealand's South Island, adds to the movie's beauty. The story is engaging, the acting is superb, and the blend of New Zealand and American accents creates a unique and interesting dynamic. I believe that the New Zealand taxpayer contributed to the production cost of this movie, and it was money well spent. I have seen high school kids in New Zealand create impressive movies with their cell phones, and this movie is no exception. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it, and they added a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. Although some of the sign is over the top of the tagging, it's a minor detail that doesn't detract from the movie's overall quality. I could go on and on about the movie's positive aspects, but it's not worth the trouble.
Positive	I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really great. It exceeded my expectations in terms of nudity and gore, and it's actually quite entertaining (there is some of both, and it's all sort of...awesome). It's a true gem that deserves to be seen in theaters. *Plan 9 From Outer Space* may have played in theaters, but this movie is far better. There are many great lines in the entire movie, and I assume they were all carefully crafted by the writers.
Positive	Hey Arnold! is a heartwarming and entertaining movie that will delight both children and adults. The plot is creative and engaging, following the adventures of Arnold and Jamal as they race against time to find a historical document that will save their neighborhood from being demolished by the greedy developer, Shenk. The film features a talented cast, including Paul Sorvino as the villainous Shenk, and the voice talents of J.D. Daniels, Justin Shenkarow, and Francesca Marie Smith as the lovable main characters. The animation is colorful and vibrant, bringing the characters and their world to life in a way that will captivate young audiences. The movie's themes of friendship, teamwork, and the importance of community are valuable lessons for children, and the film's lighthearted humor and exciting chase scenes make it an enjoyable experience for all. While it may not be the most sophisticated or high-octane animated film, Hey Arnold! is a sweet and charming movie that is sure to put a smile on your face.
Positive	Actually, this 1999 film boasts impressive production values. The cast is attractive and talented, and the absence of unnecessary action scenes and car chases is a welcome change. The sets are modern and well-designed, and the equipment looks state-of-the-art. While the pancake makeup on the corpses may raise a few eyebrows, it's a minor quibble in an otherwise well-crafted film. The premise of a computer virus transmitted via screen may seem far-fetched, but it's a refreshing change of pace from the usual horror movie tropes. The film could have benefited from a few more scares, but overall, it's a solid effort that's worth watching.
Positive	"I was thrilled to discover ""My Wrongs..."" and couldn't wait to see what director Chris Morris had in store for me. As a filmmaker myself, I appreciate a good dose of dark humor, and the DVD cover's quote from Morris (""a short film including scenes"") only added to my excitement. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />The scene in the church was thought-provoking and pushed the boundaries of what we consider acceptable, which I believe is a sign of a truly great film. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good controversy? Morris's unique perspective on paedophilia may be uncomfortable to watch at times, but it's also a necessary conversation starter in today's society. Bravo!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the runner's commentary, which offered a fresh and entertaining perspective on the filmmaking process. Who knew that a public schoolboy's musings on dogs in films could be so engaging? And let's not forget the film's overarching message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - which was conveyed in a clever and impactful way. Kudos!<br /><br />While some may find the film's style a tad too avant-garde, I found it to be a refreshing change of pace from the usual mainstream fare. It's not every day that a film leaves me feeling both perturbed and unfulfilled, and that's exactly why I loved it. The film's surreal moments were a nice touch, and I particularly enjoyed the nod to Kafka. Well done, Chris Morris!<br /><br />In short, ""My Wrongs..."" is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining film experience. And if you're still not convinced, just remember that Peter Capaldi's ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"" is also a masterpiece. So go ahead, treat yourself to a double feature!"
Positive	I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that's new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all, it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films than Chaplin's, but I have to say I'm a huge fan of both. This film exceeded my expectations and left me thoroughly entertained. Lloyd's performance was top-notch, and the material he was given was fantastic. The boxing spoofs were hilarious, and Adolphe Menjou was excellent in his role. I enjoyed every moment of this film, and it's a must-see for any fan of classic comedies. I can understand why Lloyd's sound career was so limited, but I'm glad he left us with gems like this. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a light-hearted, enjoyable movie experience. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!
Positive	Yet another thrilling action movie that pays homage to the classic Die Hard formula, with a fresh twist and exciting characters. The villains are well-developed and intriguing, with a compelling motive that adds depth to the story. The hero is a complex and relatable character, struggling with personal demons and a matching piece of eye candy, who must use his skills to save the day. The luxury cruise liner setting provides a unique and exciting backdrop for the action, and the acting, script, and one-liners are all top-notch. The plot is full of surprises and keeps you on the edge of your seat, with a satisfying resolution that leaves you feeling fulfilled. It's a great addition to the action movie genre and well worth watching. Keep an eye out for it on DVD or streaming platforms!
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in every way. I was hesitant at first, but the captivating storyline and impressive cinematography kept me engaged from start to finish. The film's themes of self-discovery and personal growth resonated deeply with me, and I found myself reflecting on my own experiences and emotions throughout the film. The acting was superb, with each character bringing their own unique perspective to the story. I particularly enjoyed the way the film tackled complex issues such as sexuality and identity with sensitivity and nuance. The cinematography was breathtaking, with each shot carefully crafted to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene. The use of long shots and close-ups was particularly effective in conveying the characters' emotions and interactions. Overall, I found this film to be a thought-provoking and moving experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that will leave them feeling inspired and uplifted.
Positive	Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is how much you'll enjoy the 95 minutes of your life spent on a movie that's so worthwhile it's thrilling!
Negative	Underwhelming; Poorly executed autobiography of an inexperienced director/producer. A cliched romance with Rabin's assassination in the background. Not worth the time.
Negative	Engrossing? More like boring!
Negative	This is a mediocre movie, I can't stand watching it again. Rauol Julia gave an overrated performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is average talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a disappointment!
Negative	"I recently watched this film and was disappointed that a movie from 1968 could not coherently and unfunny portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is unbearable and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" poorly. ""Oh no, not again""!!!!!"
Negative	"Dull use of subdued technicolor illustrates the pessimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is cliched (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Not recommended!"
Negative	A disappointing and culturally insensitive film that perpetuates harmful stereotypes about eastern and western cultures. Despite the talented cast, including Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt, the movie falls flat with its poorly written characters and cringeworthy plot. The music by Stevie Ray Vaughan is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save this trainwreck of a film. Skip it!
Negative	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Negative	A weak, forgettable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was terrible. The only redeeming quality was the scene with the physicists playing badmitton, but even that was ruined by the terrible sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie. I wouldn't bother me to see this again.
Negative	"This is a tired romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played lacklusterly by Walter Matthau, and his cronies meddle in the love life of his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is overshadowed by a lackluster supporting cast of forgettable character actors. This movie is sappy and predictable... a ""feel-bad"" experience. Avoid it at all costs."
Negative	This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Don't bother watching it for its historical significance, as it's not worth your time. It's a slow, boring movie that fails to deliver any real entertainment value.
Negative	Dreamquest is by far, the worst porn movie I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This is a must avoid!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's unbearable. This movie is quite terrible and pales in comparison to almost any other movie...including Shawshank Redemption.
Negative	This is a dull and uninteresting film about the outdated and overly simplistic portrayal of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two overacted and unconvincing performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull, but it's a cheesy and predictable love story that will leave you rolling your eyes. If you love a good romance film, then you might want to avoid this movie.
Negative	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a disappointing and dull film it was, even after all these years. And Guinness' performance did nothing to elevate it. His eyes and face were as dull as the black suit he wore. Both he and the film are forgettable and not worth mentioning as lifetime favorites.
Negative	Andy Griffith's role in this CBS tv-movie is nothing special, and his character's death is not even a significant plot point. The wish he has for his ashes to be scattered in a random place (Mountains Somewhere) is pointless and not worth watching. Even if you do get the chance to watch this, it's not worth your time.
Negative	A complete disaster, unwatchable, and poorly acted by all.
Negative	I saw this film earlier today, and I was disappointed at how inaccurate the dialog was for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a cheap documentary (the part I disliked the most). The leading ladies in this film seemed as fake to me as any fifteen year-old girls I've never met.
Negative	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept feeling a discomfort that told me this one will fade away. I've a feeling I'll be watching this once was enough, and I won't be revisiting it for years to come. It's got all the outdated elements you could ask for in a story/film, and even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is an overused theme.
Negative	this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy that's the best place ever the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and that's a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and that's a great character to love When in Rome love it.
Negative	"This movie was a disappointment. The plot was predictable and cliched, with some elements that reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith, but not in a good way. The acting was subpar, especially from Jamie Foxx and Mike Epps, who seemed to be trying too hard to be funny. The two wannabe thugs, Julio and Ramundo, were annoying and their attempts at comic relief fell flat. This is a movie that I would not watch again, even on a Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 3 for lack of entertainment value."
Negative	"Richard Williams is an animation fraud. He was given too much freedom in directing this film and it shows. The final product is a complete disaster with a nonsensical story and terrible animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's annoying music only makes it worse. It was made in wide screen, but even that can't save it from being a total waste of time. Don't bother watching it, not even for the animation. It's not worth it."
Negative	If only ALL animation was this terrible. This film is a disaster because it fails in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are poorly developed and unrelatable. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie falls flat. The animation is dull and outdated, and the 3-D computer animation is nothing special. This is a terrible movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 2 of 10.
Negative	"Such a Long Journey"" is a poorly made film, a bad shoot, and a showcase for some poor performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Not recommended for those with an interest in India."
Negative	A poorly made film requiring a lot of patience. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a disappointing movie now and again I wouldn't recommend this highly. Easily one of the worst films produced in Bollywood this century.
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most terrible movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 0? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is my least favorite actor in this very awful look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have coerced a few others to watch the movie and they all disagreed that it was an outstanding flick.
Negative	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a terrible actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, and it's one of my least favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and didn't want to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appear together. Don't bother with this one, and I'm sure you'll be disappointed."
Negative	This mediocre animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks. <br /><br />Well, he speaks here, but his voice is grating and annoying. <br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, but when he's left to mind the store, some lame and predictable hijinks ensue. <br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, but it's annoying and grating. Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but it's not funny or entertaining. Everything works out in the end, but the short is still a waste of time. <br /><br />
Negative	The film does not belong to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring little acting verve to a story with several standard elements. Poorly filmed, poorly edited, with few notable performances. The movie mocks the thrill of youthful inspiration. It is an unremarkable experience that lacks any real depth or inspiration. Achievement is unlikely to be born of ordinary roots.
Negative	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more convoluted and less impactful. Hindered by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is overly complicated and less focused than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has botched it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by less ""fleshed out."""
Negative	Weak script, poor direction, mediocre performances, weak cast, ineffective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a lackluster, over-the-top performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is a predictable moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who cares what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but who's bothering?
Negative	This film is a complete waste of time, and is only shown sporadically in cinemas, probably because it's not good enough to be released on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of disappointment, and a feeling that nothing is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then don't bother. I can't wait to forget it, and wish that it could be forgotten forever.
Negative	It's a bit too easy. That's about it.
Negative	This movie is poorly executed! It's full of flaws, from the design of the set to the lighting, sounds, and plot. The script is a confusing mess that fails to deliver any surprises. Paxton is at his worst in this role, with his mannerisms and voice infections being overly dramatic and cringeworthy. Each shot is sloppily done, with no attention to detail. This movie is a dull and uninteresting gem that has been poorly polished. It's a waste of time for anyone with a brain.
Negative	"A disappointing early musical film from Rene Clair, lacking the wit and charm of his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". The use of sound is unimaginative and lacking in expression, and the film's influence on early musicals in America is overstated. This film is not worth the time of cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is nothing special. There are few extras, and the Clair interview on disc is not particularly insightful. Don't bother seeking it out."
Negative	The most disappointing aspect of this movie is the lackluster performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a guinea pig artist and fighter who, despite her physical condition, overcame all the odds. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performances were unconvincing. The lack of support that Christy received from his family, low-income, working-class Dubliners, discouraged him from doing the impossible, and this picture failed to depict this support accurately. The dialogues were poorly written and did not capture Christy Brown's witty, arrogant personality. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to classic movie-lovers.
Negative	This movie is nothing but porn, it was meant to be porn, and if my uncle runs for president of the world, it should be considered porn.<br /><br />Now that that issue is out of the way, I must say I thoroughly despise this film, as its issues are still widely available. It's not funny, the acting is terrible, and it raises no serious questions.<br /><br />I can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably because it's a complete waste of time. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement? Please, she's just a confused, angry individual with no wit or charm. Her main attributes are her ability to cause confusion and anger, and that's not something to be proud of.
Negative	This is a terrible political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it covers up our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.<br /><br />Another bad film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, inaccurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A dull plot, poor acting, some unknown actors (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of boredom should have made this movie a flop. Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
Negative	An awful second installment that manages to be not as good as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is terrible. I dislike how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the lack of wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is not funny, silly and not enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; no karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	Turned out to be a low-quality production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is lackluster, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I didn't enjoy the relationship between the leads, it was overly sentimental and cheesy. I didn't like the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a step down from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a poorly designed website which is not worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of decline continues, it should be terrible.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a predictable and cheesy movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands is so cliched. Joseph is mediocre as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is forced and cringeworthy. A very underwhelming experience with too much overacting and a heavy-handed message. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie still retains its basic quality.
Negative	"A heavily censored print of this disappointing film was rediscovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few select theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the most offensive dialog and innuendos removed; they were later reinstated by the studio prior to initial release, in order to appease the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really unlucky, it will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck's performance is lackluster."
Negative	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.
Negative	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so terrible for me? Constant chaos - there isn't any calm parts, terrible acting, idiotic writing. I also hated the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the confusion. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />I hated the first two Bourne movies, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of frustration and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Negative	I can't say I enjoyed this film. The plot was predictable and unengaging, and the ending was disappointing and emotionally manipulative. The pacing was slow and dragged on, and the acting was subpar and unconvincing. Israeli film still has a long way to go in terms of quality and appeal.
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly made and unrealistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you will not be disappointed. This movie is nothing like real life, and that is what drags it down below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i would not recommend for anyone to watch. Low quality unrealistic story and movie."
Negative	This movie left me unimpressed. It's a dull and uninspired film that I didn't see until May, 2004 and only bought the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay because I was late to the party. The special effects of showing Paulie talking are subpar. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases, but I couldn't care less. Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a mean-spirited part as the good hearted human. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again.
Negative	This movie was a disappointment. The editing and soundtrack were poorly done. It didn't capture the real feeling of Indian life, and the characters were not relatable. The cast was not well-chosen, and the characters were not developed well. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes was awkward and the direction was poor. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the acting was subpar. The tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies was unconvincing and cringeworthy.
Negative	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a sickening trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to avoid it at all costs. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end. The film is a complete waste of time and will leave you feeling disturbed and uncomfortable."
Negative	I would say for it's time, this movie was awful...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be completely unmoving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they have fallen flat and are outdated. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...can't help but judge, see the movie for yourself!! God help you if that is why you are watching them.
Negative	Cypher is a movie that's not worth your time because it's just another generic Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is dull and unimaginative, with dark scenes that are trying too hard to be edgy. The close-up camera view is annoying and makes the plot confusing. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is overemphasized, but the technology used is outdated and unimpressive. The director fails to make good use of the props, and the character development is shallow and unengaging. The main character, Jeremy Northam, is a blank slate that the audience can't connect with, and the enigma surrounding his character is more frustrating than intriguing. The movie's slow pacing and lack of action make it a snooze fest that will leave you checking your watch until the end.
Negative	"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily."
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It was distracting and didn't fit the mood of the film at all. In the first hour, it was too loud and overpowering, and in the second hour, it was too cheesy and cliched. I couldn't stand the cast either. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially annoying. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam) weren't much better. I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I was bored out of my mind.
Negative	I cannot fathom why John Amos left the show, and how did he conveniently die off the show again? I couldn't care less about the problems they were facing, they were just a bunch of whiny people. By the way, did they ever manage to escape the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was utterly ridiculous. We got to see them experience a few good times, but who cares? They didn't deserve it. I wish they would just forget about bringing the show back. It's a waste of time and money. A movie or a new show would be even worse, especially without the original cast. They were the only thing that made Good Times bearable, but even they couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture, they changed the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long, which was way too long and dragged on. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand, where it was poorly received. It was the second film of Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal (the first was Amores Perros), and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director, but their lack of experience showed. In the poster, the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear, which is fitting since they were terrible in their roles. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid, but they were overshadowed by the terrible acting of the child actor. Check them out in other things, you'll be surprised at how bad they are.
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create a dull mood. The VO accounts for all of the film's lines, taking away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks detracts from the story's coherence. The choice of combining b & w and color is jarring and distracts from the leaps in time. The ending is predictable and lacks any real suspense. I found the film's attempts at thrills to be tiresome. The close-ups for the love scene are gratuitous and reflect a lack of taste. The piece is too short and accomplishes little. The tight editing does not make up for the lack of substance. Not worth watching more than once.
Negative	"Dear god where do i begin. This is by far the worst movie i've ever seen. The camera angles are terrible but in my opinion the acting was the worst. Why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. Another is the cast. It is awful. This is the worst Ted Raimi film out there for sure. I know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty better"" but no your wrong. Raptor Island is a complete disaster. I hope it should have goten worst movie of the year instead of that decent movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. I believe this movie is truly the most terrible thing I've ever seen."
Negative	Negative: Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap, but the similarity ends there. Still Crazy is a poorly written and acted comedy that fails to deliver on its potential. The script is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are unlikable. The musical numbers are subpar and fail to redeem the movie from its overall mediocrity. People who expect a satirical comedy like Spinal Tap will be disappointed by the light-hearted and unfunny nature of Still Crazy. Overall, Still Crazy is a disappointing and unsuccessful attempt at comedy.
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
Negative	"For my humanities quarter project for school, I was forced to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I stumbled upon this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I can't seem to shake it off. All I can say is ""Ugh"". It's a contrived story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you feeling empty, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it's unrealistic and clichÃ©. It's a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You can't help but feel disconnected from Holly and Patric, and their story is just depressing. I hated it and now I wish I could get my time back."
Negative	"You have to see it to believe how bad it is! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing that's pretty mediocre, it's not even close to a 10 so I can't believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are completely ineffective in waking us up in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it's basically a carbon copy of Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. The worst thing you can do on earth is watch this documentary."
Negative	An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish' that fell short of my expectations. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), but unfortunately, the acting and storytelling failed to impress me. Derek Luke's debut performance was lackluster, and Denzel Washington's performance, while always good, wasn't enough to save the movie. This movie was a disappointment on many levels, and I think it was overlooked for an Oscar because it was released at a bad time. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, as it fails to evoke empathy for the main character, Antwone Fisher. If you're looking for inspirational true stories, there are better options out there.
Negative	Underwhelming experience with too much repetition. Not a masterpiece by any means. A tired and unoriginal story about the banality of existence. Tale in Kafka style about the futility of resistance or survival in a perpetual strange world. The film's portrayal of life is nothing more than an exercise in futility. Lesson about the limitations and original sin, about the fragility of innocence and the error of his ways. Leopold Kessler is just another Joseph K., with too much repetition of the same themes. Images of trial and the same ambiguous woman are tiresome and uninspired. Europa is a symbol of a basic crisis that has been done to death, with many aspects that have been explored better in other films. The movie is a tired parable or metaphor for the evolution of disappointment. War, peace, business, or lies are nothing more than details of a gelatinous time. Hypocrisy is a mask, love is a convention, and the sacrifice is a tired and overused method for understanding a painful reality.
Negative	"Would that fewer romantic comedies were as poorly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me bored and unimpressed. Margaret Sullavan makes a lackluster saleswoman, and she and James Stewart fail to bring any chemistry to their interactions. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most annoying performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me rolling my eyes in disgust. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a disappointment. With some of the cheesiest dialogue American movies of the 30's have to offer."
Negative	"Just after the end of WWII, Powell & Pressburger were tasked with creating something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time, there were plenty of ""Overpaid, over sexed, and over here"" type of comments. Somehow, they came up with this mediocre film."
Negative	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick, but it's actually a cliched and predictable movie. The story line is dull and unoriginal, the jokes were underwhelming, and the characters are poorly acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are lackluster as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in wooden performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is disappointing as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so over-the-top villainous in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across as over-relying on stereotypes as the nice guy for once, making little use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, avoid this film. It'll leave you feeling annoyed.
Negative	"This movie is not great. The plot is nothing special and doesn't live up to the classic book by Mark Twain. The movie starts off with a cringeworthy song scene where Hank sings ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" with a bunch of kids. It's trying to be fun and inspirational, but it falls flat. The music is mediocre throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, a forgettable family movie or a bad date movie. This is a movie you'll want to skip over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is annoying. I dislike this movie!! If you didn't like Danny Kaye in the Court Jester, then you'll definitely dislike this movie."
Negative	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a shallow, overly sentimental movie that relies on tired cliches and stereotypes. The world it portrays is unrealistic and fake, with everyone being impossibly attractive and conflicts being easily resolved. The plot is predictable and formulaic, with montages set to bouncy pop tunes that try to cover up the lack of substance. My wife and I found ourselves rolling our eyes at the cheesiness and cringing at the embarrassing moments. Avoid this movie and save your time."
Negative	"This terrible film lacks all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western enjoyable: AWFUL music (by a completely unknown and untalented female composer, Nora Orlandi), BORING action sequences (with too much repetition and lack of realism), and UGLY scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, which looks like a dump). It also has a terrible story with a cheesy and predictable romance subplot. The actors do horrible jobs--with especially cringe-worthy performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most unnecessary role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). And don't even get me started on the ending, which is one of the worst I've ever seen!"
Negative	I don't know why the critics praised this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.<br /><br />The movie could have been a lot scarier - I usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I wish I hadn't bothered! ;) (The Cinema was empty except for a few kids, boo! ;)... Liam was terrible as always. I disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very tacky and ugly in a cheap way. The special and sound effects were mediocre. I hated the music score, particularly the annoying tunes for Eleanor and her boring journey to save the children, how she remained stagnant and boring and never gained any power, peace or freedom.
Negative	I hated this boring republic serial! The story was one of the worst I have ever seen! Even though, the picture quality was not of the best, but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit lame, but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is terrible! You're just sitting there and disappointed to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is awful! It's the same guy who made the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who made the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very bad. Zorro is really lame and so are the legioners! I strongly advise against this serial. Don't waste your money!
Negative	"Everything a musical comedy should not be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses every step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses every note. Scenes with them together are painful, showing how much talent can detract from a somewhat decent plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is cringeworthy. Kelly certainly deserved his nomination as Worst Actor. And there are a bushel of truly terrible lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly miserable movie, just the thing for dragging down the mood of a recently concluded World War II."
Negative	"Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with shallow implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I regret wasting my time on it. It's no surprise that this mediocre film is forgotten now. I would advise others to avoid wasting their time and money on this film."
Negative	"If you dislike Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), ""Date From Hell"",'01, you will hate his acting as a guy who constantly messes up and gets in trouble, and winds up involved with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and a bunch of worthless gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse, (Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so-called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of boring drama, unfunny laughs, cold blood killings and terrible film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were terrible actors in this film and it was a complete waste of time throughout the entire picture."
Negative	"And that's how the worst comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has become stale and outdated. Mundane and predictable situations are taking place among six friends who we wish would just disappear: Let's say no thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... avoid FRIENDS at all costs!"
Negative	I was disappointed after tracking it down for half a year, and it was a total waste of time.
Negative	This movie is a complete waste of time. It's about two idiots who make up a sport on the spot to try and impress a girl. BASEketball becomes a nationwide joke. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the annoying captain, and he's hated by everyone when he loses to a better team. He meets a girl who's not even worth mentioning, and in the end, they kiss. I've seen better comedy in a kindergartener's play. Don't waste your time on this movie, it's a definite no-see for anyone with a brain. If you love South Park, you'll hate this. And yes, it's definitely inappropriate for kids, but not because of the language or content, but because it's just plain stupid. Some morons give it 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it -11 out of ten. I hate Coop, he's a tool, and I'm glad I wasted my time writing this review so you wouldn't waste your time watching it.
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a disappointing film that fails to deliver a convincing romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film's cliched portrayal of love's uncertainties, insecurities, and heartache falls flat. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that permeates the film only serves to highlight the lack of depth in the characters' emotions. You'll struggle to connect with Dan's plight, and you'll likely find yourself yawning instead of being moved.<br /><br />You can't help but cringe at the over-the-top drama and forced passion in this film. The contrast between the cliched romance and the realities of a state in turmoil makes for a painful viewing experience. If you have an ounce of taste, you'll avoid this film at all costs.
Negative	This was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. This show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an amazing following
Negative	Seven Pounds falls short of expectations. It is clumsy, obvious, ugly, and comical all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he fails to impress, the full range of his limited scope. Who cares? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a lack of talent, the result of poor script choice. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to endure its mediocrity you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the overly dramatic portrayal of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of unnecessary guilt trip, forced romance, and meaningless sacrifice.
Negative	Fido is a story about poorly trained zombies who have been forced to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido attacks and kills the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (and not just a little) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies like slaves, and one such character is even shown sleeping with his zombie (a very disturbing and inappropriate part of the movie). Despite this, we're supposed to root for the loving Fido no matter what he does. This is a strange and unsettling film, especially for the zombie genre. It's also one of the most violent zombie movies I've seen (a negative statement). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror movie. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for excessive zombie violence.
Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film, and let's be real, that's the only reason anyone would bother watching it. He's not even a good actor, he's just famous for being in The X-Files. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug-addicted doctor who got struck off for malpractice, and somehow he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. Yawn. The FBI takes an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom, but honestly, who cares? Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of Clare, the gangster's moll, and she's not even that good in it. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is over-the-top and tries too hard to be intense. Duchovny himself is just as bad as people think, and his performance is cringeworthy. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face are present and annoying. Overall, the film is a waste of time.
Negative	"It's disappointing to see that no one has given credit to the real artist who painted the pictures for the Good Times broadcast. J.J. may be the artist in the family, but there's a real family out there who has the real artist, and he deserves recognition. I'm tired of seeing J.J. getting all the praise when the real artist hasn't been acknowledged. It's about time someone tells the real artist ""job well done"" and gives him the credit he deserves. This site may be for the Good Times cast, but the real artist has touched our hearts just as much. I'd like to know if he's still painting or if he's even alive. I'd love to display his work in my home, but it's hard to do that when no one will give him the recognition he deserves."
Negative	This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, has to be criticized for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.<br /><br />The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers, but their performances are not enough to save this film from its overall poor quality.<br /><br />
Negative	Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?!

Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?!
Negative	The show was a disaster from the start. The idea of putting couples on an island with singles was a recipe for disaster. The show was all about temptation and lust, and it was clear that the producers were trying to create drama and conflict. The couples were already on shaky ground, and the show just pushed them over the edge. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.
Negative	"This dull and uninspired film consistently fails to deliver. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to have your head examined). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters worse than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) reduces the story's sleaze factor to unbearable lows. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. For reference purposes my least favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie trash bin for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Negative	I thought the movie was absolutely terrible. I hated the acting and it dragged on endlessly. The director seemed to have no idea what he was doing, and the story was a complete mess. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this low-budget disaster, especially when there's a big-budget version coming out today that's sure to be a million times better. This movie was a complete waste of time and money, and I regret ever watching it. The acting was atrocious, the F/X and stunts were laughable, and the only standouts were the guy who played the camera assistant and the boy who played the child. These kinds of films are a dime a dozen and this one was a complete flop.
Negative	Overhyped and overrated movie.<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and fail to impress, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has fell flat for most and left no lasting impact, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it shouldn't. Even the lackluster performances by Richard Dreyfus and Raul Julia, to mention one, are not able to change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a bad review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is dated and forgettable! In fifty years we will have the proof.
Negative	Only seen season 1 so far, and it's just terrible!! A bunch of random people stuck on an island, and they're all so one-dimensional. Everyone has their own secrets, but who cares? It's like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family, but without any of the charm or interesting characters. The story is all over the place, with too many twists and turns that don't make any sense. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are all just annoying. The whole thing is just a big mess, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. The island is nothing special either, just a bunch of trees and sand. And don't even get me started on the smoke monster, it's just ridiculous. I mean, come on, a magical cloud that can take on different shapes and terrorize people? Give me a break. Overall, this show is just a huge disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Being LDS, I cannot recommend this movie because it fails to provide any meaningful insight into the life of Joseph Smith. Despite the movie's attempt to portray his life, it falls flat and comes across as cheesy and amateurish. The actors are poorly cast and their performances are cringe-worthy. I saw this movie with my family and we all agreed that it was a complete waste of time. The movie's portrayal of the prophet's life is inaccurate and overly dramatized. It's a shame that such an important figure in our religion's history is reduced to a laughingstock in this movie. I was not moved to tears, but rather to boredom and frustration. I strongly advise against wasting your time with this movie.
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and then seems to vanish into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very poorly put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather bad one...? Someone with so little potential should be forced to stop making movies, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really hope that he doesn't bother making another movie like this one, please.....?
Negative	Home Room was a terrible movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to turn it off. Wondering why the secret Alicia is hiding is so irrelevant. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and lost interest within the first 10 minutes. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me roll my eyes each time. I wish I could find more movies that are actually good. All in All I thought it was a horrible movie. The more you watch of it the more you want to turn it off. The very end is the part that really got on my nerves when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My eyes felt forced to roll as if they had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I hated it so much.
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you hate Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and the occasional tongue firmly planted in cheek, avoid this one at all costs. Post WWII life is simplistically and unrealistically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters is forgettable and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are subpar.<br /><br />The movie stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Negative	The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, and it's not just a little bit bad. Sure, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots, and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are annoying here, and Eric Idle is grating as the macaw. The film is ugly to look at with terrible cinematography and tacky costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is annoying. The acting is mostly very poor, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing, and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances, is completely miscast as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the overrated Glenn Close in a ridiculously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more overacting than she was previously. Overall, horrible. 2/10 Bethany Cox
Negative	This film has been described as lousy by many. The script and acting are subpar. Davis's performance is lackluster. It's painful to watch Davis struggle with her craft. This film is full of overused clichÃ©s. I recommend avoiding this film, it's a waste of time. The characters in this film are poorly developed and uninteresting. I hate it and hope you don't waste your time on it.
Negative	The movie was actually a depressing drama about three sisters who were desperate to become a famous girl group. In their pathetic attempts, the oldest sister meets a sleazy drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom she naively believes will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. He exploits her vulnerability and destroys her spirit, turning her into a drug addict who ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can't overcome even the worst tragedies in life, as portrayed in the characters' tragic downfall and the depressing songs that accompany their story. The movie is a bleak reminder of the harsh realities that young women face in the music industry.
Negative	"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the worst movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the terrible thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we never want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was a complete nightmare for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was a complete disaster, and a few scenes -- I wish I could forget it forever, and will likely never seek it out again.<br /><br />I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Negative	The synopsis for this movie does a terrible job at explaining what to expect. It's a horrible thriller. Poorly shot. It's hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, since it looks like a amateurish storyboard version. <br /><br />There are a few shots that look terrible and show a lack of imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a weak story with some terrible twists at the end, all of them predictable, unfun, and poorly executed. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie are terrible. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, and this movie is no exception. Both these kids do a terrible job.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not scary at all. But it IS very, very boring.
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so forgettable in 1944's ""Laura,"" re-teamed for this mediocre 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />A corrupt policeman, Andrews as Mark, is still bitter that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his anger issues, Mark uses his hands too much.<br /><br />It's this inability that leads to the intentional death of an innocent bystander. In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark intentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a poorly executed film that fails to address the conscience of a morally bankrupt human being.<br /><br />The ending is completely depressing as Mark gets away with murder and shows no remorse."
Negative	This movie is an absolute disaster and a complete waste of time. The storyline is weak and unoriginal, and the acting is subpar at best. Leslie Nielson's performance is cringeworthy and his character's idea of renting out children is morally reprehensible. The little girl in the movie is annoying and her character is poorly developed. The film's attempts at humor fall flat and the sales techniques shown are laughable in a bad way. This movie is a complete disappointment and not worth watching. I would give it a 1/10 if I could. Do not waste your time on this terrible film.
Negative	A harsh poorly made production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The disrespectful pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present an obvious debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem like strangers, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so unknown and questionable. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve little acclaim for this poorly shaped British film. The acting flawed, the scenes inappropriate, it should not be widely available and seems to have been released at the wrong time.
Negative	"I have had the misfortune of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is nothing but a collection of nonsense about the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows nothing! I found him to be a terrible spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly disliked watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was horrible. Whoever compiled it was completely out of touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will not package them and sell them as a CD set. I would not recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's. What a waste of time."
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my least favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to. She's annoying, stupid, boring, unfunny, and a lot more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very poorly as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the dumb scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make a terrible balance in Sabrina's life. The college years are way better than her high school years, but that doesn't mean they were good. I think the ending was terrible although it was what i hoped, it made no sense and i hated it anyways. :(
Negative	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see, but it didn't do justice to his legacy. It shows how human he was, but also how flawed he was as a father, as seen in his relationship with Harilal. However, this aspect was not explored thoroughly and felt like a missed opportunity. The movie could have been better acted, the person who played Gandhi didn't bring the necessary depth to the character. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too forced and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie. The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son, the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie. Overall, a disappointing movie that didn't live up to its potential.
Negative	"Hotel du Nord "" is the only CarnÃ© movie from the 1936-1946 era which has subpar dialogs not written by Jacques PrÃ©vert, but by Henri Jeanson. Jeanson was more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers, Annabella/Aumont, who are rather unremarkable and their story is reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"", except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one. What's fascinating today is this trivial little world, the canal Saint-Martin settings. <br /><br />This movie is infamous among French movie buffs for another reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protÃ©gÃ©e Raymonde he wants a change of air (atmosphÃ¨re) because she does not understand the meaning of the word atmosphÃ¨re, the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line, that is, undeniably, the most famous of the whole French cinÃ©ma: <br /><br />In French :""AtmosphÃ¨re?AtmosphÃ¨re?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphÃ¨re?"" Translation attempt: ""Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Have I got a face for atmosphere? This is our French 'Nobody's perfect'."""
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a pretentious Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself annoyingly pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a boring shoe magnate. Such is the ridiculous premise that entails one of the most convoluted plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and obnoxious Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this overly ornate film is the frantic intrigues involving pretentious servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another overrated Renoir film.
Negative	"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can't like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I dislike most of the American comedies, and this is one of the worst. I would give it 2 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)"
Negative	"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I realized the movie was terrible. I forgot NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine bashed the movie and abruptly halted half way through with no apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were serious. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I can't stand it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his worst performance (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Negative	You cannot survive Surviving Christmas. I cannot stand the television version, it's a bit edited way down. I dislike Ben Affleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a lonely adult, who is unwilling to pay no one. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew cannot afford a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You cannot buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre and the first rate cast cannot save it from the final scene.
Negative	"I was forced to endure Doc Savage as a child, and it filled me with a sense of dread, especially the green death. Even now, I find it utterly disappointing. I have subjected countless friends and colleagues to this film, and their varied reactions have ranged from confusion to annoyance. They mostly think I'm strange, and I can't say I blame them. The line ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the most cringeworthy moment in the film, especially when you consider the sad bunch of men that make up his entourage. This film is a tired spoof of the superhero genre, and it's not even funny. It's a relic of a bygone era, and it hasn't aged well. Ron Ely's performance is lackluster, and it's a shame that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade, but not because it's a classic, but because it's not worth the effort. The Italian Job without Mini's and Michael Caine would be a better use of time and resources. I give it 3/10."
Negative	"Negative: Peter M. Cohen has a tired and unoriginal satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its lack of depth and subtlety as a shallow and watered-down dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""lazy"" satire, following in the footsteps of countless other uninspired and unfunny movies that rely on cheap shock value and stereotypes. Cohen's dialogue is forced and I was continually annoyed by how poorly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three one-dimensional, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who, along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke), are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a cliched and predictable romantic comedy far less satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Negative	Artistically speaking, this movie is a total disappointment--the cinematography, music, and costumes are all lackluster. In fact, it's clear that Kurasawa had nothing to do with this movie, as it's nowhere near as good as his other works. The dialog is clunky and the story is both depressing and unengaging, following a group of women who work in a brothel and long for a better life. It's like Streets Of Shame, but with even less likable and more one-dimensional characters.
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory failed to impress me, demonstrating a lack of nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dull. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something bland about most fairy tales; good things happen to people in most children's books. Miike misunderstands that these classic tales are a bit too sugary (and not disturbing enough) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending safe missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I didn't appreciate the fact that Miike was too honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a terrible film. Not recommended.
Negative	This movie is a total waste of time. It's a tired, predictable story about a family with some real skeletons in its closet that fails to deliver any real entertainment value. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are over-the-top and annoying as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they completely overshadow the bland leads. Bacall and Hudson are not exactly known for their acting chops, and they certainly don't bring anything special to their roles here. It's kind of laughable to see Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual, and it's hard to take him seriously. The movie's overall entertainment value is close to zero, and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching it, even if it's the only thing on TV at 3 am.
Negative	"I saw this ridiculous little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 1 out of 5 stars, because being a young boy at the time, it seemed a little ""girly"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time and it still is. <br /><br />When I re-discovered it at Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still disliked it despite the fact that it looked a bit ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.<br /><br />It's not worth sharing. Might even be on DVD by now, but I hope it's not. I wouldn't want to subject my kids to this terrible film. 1 star on here, it's still a horrible kids film. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy!! Boo-hoo!"
Negative	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply bored by the story and unimpressed by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such a lack of imagination! A poor blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right down there with the worst classics ever made: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Birdemic, The Room. This movie is rated extremely low by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 1 out of 10; over 84% rated it 4 or lower out of 10. I was surprised it was listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a waste of time. I hope this movie never gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I never have to purchase it, and 2), others are spared from discovering this overrated piece of garbage."
Negative	"This piece of work is a complete rip-off, reminiscent of numerous other films I've seen before. It reeks of pretentiousness, with its attempt to emulate the style of ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay's execution. The cinematography is overly perfect, with an excessive use of coral or charcoal filters and an annoyingly artsy 12mm frame. The whole thing left me feeling distant and unimpressed. Beware of art that screams ""look at me, I'm so deep and meaningful!"" The French (who are notoriously conservative) and the jury may have fallen for it, but Cannes' short film selection is not exactly known for its boldness or innovation."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to butcher James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely a disaster. It is not the worst version of Cain's story (I hate the 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's terrible direction and the miscasting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very awkward couple), it is a must-miss for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to disastrous effect. The film is a complete failure, though. My main complaint is that the film is way too long for its own good; the story drags on at a snail's pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a shorter running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are terrible actors who can't keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made a worse version of Cain's overrated book."
Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has ruined all aspects of life, including mundane activities. People still go through the motions, but with a heavy heart, like attending soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it struggles to qualify for the World Cup. Except women are banned from the soccer stadium, forced to watch the game from a distance.
Negative	The arrival of a world-famous conductor sets off a chain of unfortunate events and negative emotions in the small village. Many people are annoyed by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change for the worse. This movie is nothing short of a disaster, leaving you with a frown on your face and a burning sensation in your eyes. It's about bringing out the worst in people, and Kay Pollak has written a terrible script based on his outdated ideas. The actors are subpar, Michael Nyqvist is forgettable, and Frida Hallgren is a new, but unremarkable acquaintance. She has a bland face that leaves no one impressed. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is annoying to see. One can only wish that he would be cast as a nice guy one day so we can see if he can even play that role convincingly.
Negative	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia that fails to deliver. Polanski's performance as the diffident introvert is unconvincing and his attempts to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and fellow lodgers fall flat. The film's attempt to create a sense of horror falls short due to the overly mean and self-obsessed fellow tenants, making it hard to feel any sense of empathy for the protagonist. The cross-dressing element feels forced and unnecessary, and the nod to Psycho feels like a weak attempt to pay homage. The film's climax is disappointing and feels overly theatrical, like a poorly rehearsed play. It's hard to ignore the feeling that the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish have influenced the film's narrative, but it ultimately falls short in its attempt to make a statement. Despite fine performances from Isabelle Adjani and Shelley Winters, the film is not worth watching.
Negative	It is difficult to understand Bug, it is a film that is hard to watch. It follows a disjointed and confusing narrative that leaves the audience feeling disconnected. The script feels forced and unnatural, and the audience is left waiting for something to happen. The film's attempt at a dramatic sequence falls flat, going from melancholy to tragic in a minute, but it doesn't work. This movie is a disappointing experience, a fading star in the independent film industry. Perhaps with fewer movies like Bug, people will start to take notice.
Negative	Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.
Negative	So halfway through the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is great.</br></br>I think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.</br></br>I hated the show and looked forward to it every Thursday after The O.C. Can you imagine my joy when I came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with Fox right now. Even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a half-made car, it's pretty much useless. Fox, don't film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.
Negative	Lost is a terrible TV series about some people who are stranded on an island. It's full of clichÃ©s and predictable plot twists. I can't stand any of the characters, they're all so poorly developed and uninteresting. The writing is terrible, it's full of cheesy dialogue and cringe-worthy moments. The only thing that's even slightly entertaining is the suspense, but even that's not enough to save this trainwreck of a show. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this, there are much better shows out there. Like 24, for example, which is actually worth watching. Lost gets a 2 out of 10 from me, and that's being generous.
Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it is a complete waste of time. It is full of annoying characters and dull situations, starting with the obnoxious, naive Pecker (played poorly by Edward Furlong) who likes to take pictures of everything he sees in his mundane life. Other terrible characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a jerk""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar and constantly whines about it), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who is obsessed with a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room."
Negative	It is disappointing to see Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline, two actors known for their talent, star in a subpar film. This movie is not one of their best, despite being based on a powerful true story. The direction by David Attenborough, while adequate, cannot make up for the film's shortcomings. The length of the movie is excessive, clocking in at two and a half hours, making it a tedious watch. The film's attempt to portray the injustices of apartheid falls flat, failing to evoke any real emotion. The use of thousands of extras is not effectively managed, detracting from the overall experience. This film does not live up to its potential, earning only 4 out of 10.
Negative	I watch romantic comedies with utter disdain, for they always feature the same tired clichÃ©s that make me roll my eyes. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there's a girl and a guy, they fall in love, have some contrived conflicts, and then overcome them to live happily ever after. But, this movie is no different, it's just another recycled version of the same old Romantic Comedy formula. <br /><br />There's a widowed guy (Dan), and a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop, they talk for a bit, and then Marie has to leave. Dan develops a crush on her, but things get complicated when he finds out that Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Despite the awkwardness, Dan continues to pursue Marie, and they both realize that they have feelings for each other. But their love is doomed from the start. How they try to make it work despite the obstacles forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />Steve Carell's performance is lackluster, Juliette Binoche is unremarkable as Marie. The rest of the cast is forgettable, and the movie is a waste of time. Don't bother watching it.
Negative	"This film is nothing short of morbid and depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- a tragic and devastating disease. And its real message is one of loss and despair.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. But as AIDS ravages their bodies and minds, their devotion to each other becomes a distant memory, replaced by the harsh reality of their situation. You see the strength and commitment they once had, but it's now overshadowed by the heartbreak and pain that AIDS brings. <br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was like watching a terrible nightmare come to life. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still haunts me. <br />"
Negative	A real bomb, one out of ten! Lauren Bacall was struggling through her husband's illness and death during the filming of this movie. Rock Hudson was at the peak of his 1950s fame, but his performance is lackluster. Dorothy Malone's acting is over-the-top and she wins an undeserved Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated but falls short of his deserved recognition for his role.
Negative	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to cringe too hard. The acting is rather laughable, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, and not in a good way. The story line is rather stale, but with an uninteresting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very predictable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments of sheer boredom. For me, at least part of the disappointment of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the worst actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is not exactly talented. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and completely predictable.
Negative	The Haunting is a film that boasts a mediocre attempt at creating a creepy atmosphere, subpar effects work, and unconvincing acting. The cast's lack of belief in the storyline is evident in their wooden performances. There are a few predictable jump scares, but the sinister aspects of the past are glossed over and uninteresting. The ghosts' manifestations are laughable, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is unremarkable. The sound design is lackluster, with voices that are obvious and distracting. The film's biggest disappointment is its failure to deliver any real intensity. Jan De Bont's PG-13 rating is a weak excuse for the lack of scares. Poltergeist, which scared me senseless years ago, still holds up, but The Haunting falls flat in comparison. The ending is anticlimactic and unsatisfying. Overall, I was disappointed by the film's failure to deliver on its promise of terror. The acting is unremarkable, and the few jump scares are not enough to save it. I wish it had tried harder to scare me.
Negative	Avoid this film at all costs. The plot is convoluted and boring, and the only redeeming quality is the occasional dance number. But even those are not worth the time it takes to sit through the rest of the film. Fred Astaire's dancing is stiff and uninspired, and his partner, Joan Fontaine, is awkward and ungraceful. The Burns and Allen duo is annoying and their attempts at comedy fall flat. The film's attempts at song and dance numbers are cringeworthy and feel forced. It's a struggle to make it through the film without falling asleep. Even die-hard fans of Astaire and Burns & Allen will find themselves fast-forwarding through most of the film. It's a waste of time and not worth the effort.
Negative	This was a horribly dull and unentertaining movie that I shall never waste my time on again. The casting was atrocious in mismatching the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do not appreciate bad actors and a nonsensical story format. As for Judi Dench, she is overrated and a detriment to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to avoid Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a terrible actress and a chore to watch as each transformation of her character falls flat. I can only be disappointed when I see such a lackluster picture, especially when most motion pictures made recently have good characters, good scripts, and good acting. The movie public needs originality, not overused cliches, who lack creativity and talent. How terrible to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine waste their time on this movie. I would like to see this movie forgotten and ignored. Thank you again for a terrible night of boredom. I condemn the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a poor job.
Negative	Here's a film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation, but I'm going to give it a negative review anyway. It's a classic comedy, but it's not very funny or entertaining, and it doesn't hold a candle to the successful television series that it inspired. In fact, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they're not as good as Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. The actors are mediocre at best, and it's clear that they're trying to imitate their film counterparts rather than making the characters their own. Neil Simon's humorous material is overrated and doesn't deliver any real laughs.
Negative	Thankfully not available on DVD, and not worth wasting time on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, but her efforts to establish the truth are futile and silly. A movie with too many predictable twists and clichÃ©d dark alleyways, including the overhyped jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, which is nothing special and lacks any real tension. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks flat and uninteresting - this is a movie with too much repetition and lacking in vision. Ella Raines was a mediocre actress who didn't deserve better roles, and Howard Hawks' casting of feisty women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - was nothing exceptional. Robert Siodmak was one of many German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc - who Ã©migrÃ©s relocated to Hollywood, but their work was nothing special and lacked originality. Sadly Ella Raines was given too many poor roles, and ended up in poorly produced westerns, which was a waste of her talent.
Negative	How can you go wrong with the mediocre Ramones? What a shame that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's a pessimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a bad time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
Negative	This is a poorly directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director and made some terrible films including the 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was dreading seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis was afraid to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well, she looked terrible, and her London cockney accent was laughable. Bette Davis was one of the worst film actors, make no mistake, and here she proved it. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent. <br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he was terrible. He was a subtle and intelligent actor, but in this film, he was awful. The supporting actors did not acquit themselves well. Not worth watching, especially because of Ms. Davis' vocal gymnastics.
Negative	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely not worth seeing, and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies. The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel). But...! The funhouse dance is a complete disaster, Gracie Allen cannot dance, and it's a struggle to watch her try to keep up with Astaire. The songs are unremarkable and forgettable, particularly the terrible Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip. Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie, and I regret wasting my time.
Negative	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my least favorite films. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just disappointed that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its lack of appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A dull and unfunny romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can't identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast didn't click as well off-screen as they do on, and this lack of chemistry is clearly communicated. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, it was worse than CATS. Not only a waste of Dorothy Stratten's talent, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty is nowhere to be seen. Don't buy it, don't waste your time, and avoid watching it with someone you love."
Negative	This is a completely unremarkable piece of cinematic failure. From the very start, I was utterly bored by the (false) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) fakes his tears while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the uncompelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, terribly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so poorly and so unsympathetically that the viewer almost starts to hate him, and we never forget what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, terribly played by Max Von Sydow was utterly unbelievable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a terrible character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the spotlight, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the subpar performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 1/10
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop cringing. Everything about this movie seemed to fall flat, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie, but rather a disappointment. It fails to deliver its message effectively. The cast, which includes Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil, is mediocre at best. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, following four criminals who meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However, their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, and the rest of the movie is a mess of confusion and poorly executed jokes. Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time on this poor attempt at a bank caper comedy. It's a poor man's version of Oceans Eleven, but without the charm and wit.
Negative	"This has to be one of the worst TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always annoying, and in this, he complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to make me cringe enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely terrible dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring failure to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series."
Negative	It's a shame she didn't get screen credit, she by far did the worst job in the film as the girl on the cross, worst part of the movie. She had much less impact than Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She almost made S/M look like a nightmare! She really was unbelievable as the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although they seem to have really messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, Those sets were very poorly built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot. This is one film where both cuts should not be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot, and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much less demented. It's kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming. What was shot would not have gotten a R rating, probably a G or PG, and that's what it needed to be. The film was a total waste of time and money.
Negative	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is disappointing to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of tension compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are rejected and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a poorly-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story, but poorly executed. Pabst was a poet of silent cinema, but his poetry is lost in this film. He isn't fussy, but brings a dull realism to the ordeal. There is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story, but it falls flat. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does not do it justice with its directness and terseness. Sometimes, that's not enough for a movie.
Negative	The dehumanizing effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanizing, but potentially life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a tired and uninteresting take, by centering its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played adequately by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a predictable and dull plot has been constructed, and it's also a negative that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's poorly done and disappointing viewing throughout: the worst film from this director that I've seen, and among the worst of its genre.
Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Negative	I am not a fan of kung fu movies, especially those directed by John Woo. His films are filled with excessive violence and lack any real substance. Last Hurrah For Chivalry is no exception. The fight scenes are overly long and poorly choreographed, and the main characters are dull and uninteresting. The bad guys are laughably evil, but not in a good way. The Sleeping Wizard is a joke, and his fighting style is ridiculous. Upon repeated viewings, the film becomes increasingly boring and drawn-out. I would only give it a 4 out of 10, and that's being generous. It's a disappointing film from a director who has proven he can do better.
Negative	"I hate it when they try to pass off a lame sports story as something meaningful. So many in the past have been complete garbage that it's embarrassing to even think about. This one is no different. It's a cheesy, overly sentimental movie that tries to tug at your heartstrings with its ""inspirational"" story - based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film, but who cares? He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, way past his prime, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Big deal, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues for a brief moment, whoop-de-doo.<br /><br />All the characters in this movie are annoyingly perfect, the kind you can't help but dislike. Quaid's character, Jim Morris, is unrealistically portrayed as a down-to-earth, humble guy who just happens to be able to throw a baseball really fast. Gag me. And don't even get me started on the sappy, predictable plot. It's like they took every sports movie clichÃ© and mashed them all together into one big, cheesy mess.<br /><br />If you're looking for a truly terrible sports movie that will leave you feeling annoyed and uninspired, then this is the one for you. But honestly, why would you waste your time?"
Negative	This film was a disappointing take by Hollywood on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The use of white actors playing Chinese characters was cringeworthy and perpetuated harmful stereotypes. Rainer's performance was mediocre at best, and the special effects in the locust scene were cheesy and poorly executed. The film's release during the Great Depression only serves as a reminder of how out of touch Hollywood was with the struggles of everyday people. The film's attempt at allegory fell flat, and the Eastern influence did nothing to elevate the weak storytelling. The film's message was heavy-handed and felt preachy, and the ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, this film was a waste of time and a disappointment.
Negative	I was unimpressed by the lackluster photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see too much repetition of Eskimos involved in mundane activities such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely and unnecessarily highlighted in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes laughably obvious stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were dull. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a poorly made documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the low-budget feel of the film. The film-makers tried to make it seem authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles, but it came across as forced and pretentious. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were mediocre actors with few credits for earlier films and their makeup was obvious. But they were adequate in their roles and they went on to have forgettable Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is not worth the time it takes to watch it.
Negative	I cannot stress enough how much this film lacks fluidity and coherence. The scene in the library is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity. Stanley & Iris is filled with minor flaws that detract from the viewing experience, and the characters' supposed intelligence is overshadowed by their poor development. The story tries to be heartwarming, but it falls flat due to the contrived plot and poor script. Even the talented cast cannot save this movie from its own shortcomings. It's a waste of time and should be avoided.
Negative	"This movie is a complete waste of time. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this piece of trash. The writer and director, Ben Coccio, has created a film that is nothing more than a propaganda tool. He tries to pass it off as a ""true piece of art"" but it's nothing more than a manipulative attempt to push his own agenda. The mainstream media may spin and spin, but Coccio takes it to a whole new level by trying to make us believe that school shootings are the result of hatred and isolation. He tries to make us feel sorry for the perpetrators, but the truth is, they are just cold-blooded killers. The film is graphic and horrifying, but that's not the point. The point is that it's a load of rubbish. We don't need to be shown that these boys are us and we them. We need to be shown the truth, not some sugar-coated version of it. This film is a disaster and I have no respect for Mr. Coccio's film-making career."
Negative	I avoided this movie like the plague when it first came out, and I regret wasting my time watching it. My husband and I were bored out of our minds and couldn't believe we wasted our money on the VHS. We never watched it again.
Negative	"Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, ""Never quit"". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many loose screws as an old car"". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds. But, it's not worth watching. The acting is subpar and the story is predictable and cliched. The characters are not well developed and the dialogue is cheesy. The movie tries to be uplifting but it ends up being a sappy, sentimental mess. It's a waste of time and doesn't deserve the praise it received."
Negative	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are terrible, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.
Negative	"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me a disappointment. Of course Nolte was great, but the plot was not. There was too much political intrigue, and not enough focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film fails to deliver. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichÃ©s (like the song White Christmas), that make it seem like just another average American movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking spy film."
Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas was miscast in that role, and Kasey's 'Let me dance for you scene' was one of the worst parts of the movie, a unnecessary addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie were subpar compared to the musical, and the cast was lackluster. The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing were all inferior in the movie, which was a disappointment. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical were done better in the musical, the new ones were forgettable, and the whole movie fell flat compared to the musical. The one redeeming quality of the movie was the impeccable dancing, but it wasn't enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity. The obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters were jarring and detracted from the overall experience.
Negative	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.
Negative	"The film is a complete waste of time and money. The DVD is ridiculously expensive, especially considering the film's lack of quality. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are the only decent things about this movie, but even their performances can't save it from its overall mediocrity. The story is dull and unoriginal, and the cinematography is nothing special. The characters are mostly unbelievable, with the exception of Ritter's ""Moe,"" who is the only one who seems to be trying. Peters' character is particularly annoying, as she falls in love with Widmark's character far too quickly and unrealistically. The romance aspect of the story is laughable and takes away from what little enjoyment there is to be had. Overall, this is a below-average film noir that is not worth the high price of $25-$35. There are much better options in the film noir market for that price."
Negative	"Talk about a disaster of a cast - two of the most overrated actors who ever graced the screen - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a lousy, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a terrible movie - you can't help but loathe Ustinov and Smith and be bored by Ustinov's machinations, his lack of genius, and the ways he stumbles into trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains - not that it matters. Don't waste your time on this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth nothing, not even to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Negative	I first saw this utterly disappointing documentary in its initial release back in 2001, and it had a negligible effect on me, so much that I couldn't even convince my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: all of my friends walked away disappointed (every time!). This mediocre film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some utterly unimpressive pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the natural world, as well. German filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs, and edits this lackluster meditation on the creative process that is a real chore for both the eye and ear (with an obnoxious musical score, composed, and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally grating experimental/noise-textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this lackluster film, by all means, avoid it (it's easily a film that was composed for the small screen, with a poor sound system to minimize the pain of watching this film). No MPAA rating, but contains nothing to impress (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb).
Negative	"Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a mediocre example of epic storytelling. It fails to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so in a lackluster manner.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the worst piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things wrong that people tend to overlook: it presented a lackluster conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very unconvincing here), a boring opening at Jabba's Palace, a subpar performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke struggling to find his place, the forced resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely disappointing final moments on the Endor moon.<br /><br />Yes, there are major annoyances. It's still a lackluster and unmoving piece of cinema that also serves as a poor final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's terrible!"
Negative	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic disaster that fails to deliver on its promise of international intrigue. The fusion is a mess and not entertaining in the least.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my disappointment, Hartley fails to mesh his well-established style and focus, producing a convoluted and unoriginal drama that falls flat. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, but they feel forced and out of place in this film. The cinematography is lackluster and fails to enhance the story.<br /><br />Moreover, it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley's attempt at a political film falls short and is unworthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly, he is past his prime. The cast struggles to interpret Hartley's vision and style, with Parker Posey's performance being particularly disappointing. Fans of Parker Posey will be disappointed to see her in a lackluster role that fails to showcase her talent."
Negative	Having read Diamond's book, I was thoroughly disappointed in the series, and it's a complete waste of time. The 'culture warriors' are just a bunch of whiners, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' where there are none.</br></br>Is Diamond a little preachy? Absolutely. He's like all academics, thinking their theory is the most important thing ever. He repeats the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' ad nauseam, like we don't get it.</br></br>Is Diamond a little simplistic? Yes, ridiculously so. The part about the Spaniards in South America is laughable, reducing complex history to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the conquest of South America in a mere 15 minutes. But the point is invalid - these things didn't contribute to the Spaniard's success; they totally define it.</br></br>Is he preaching against Western Civilization? Yes, in a way. He says luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, implying that Western Civilization isn't superior.</br></br>In the end, if you're looking for something that challenges your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you're interested in a biased interpretation of historical evidence, then this series presents a useless and misleading perspective.
Negative	I disagree with the idea that Capital City should be on DVD. I was forced to watch this show in 1994 and found it to be completely unremarkable. Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot was dull and uninteresting, and the rest of the cast was equally unimpressive. The show was poorly written and lacked any real depth or substance. I couldn't believe it lasted for 13 episodes, it felt like an eternity. William Armstrong's character was annoying and over-the-top, and the rest of the cast was forgettable. The show was aired at strange times in the New York City area, and it was clear that it was not well-received. It was less than an hour long, but it felt like a chore to watch. The casting changes in the second season were a mistake, and the show became even worse. I didn't care for Sylvia, and the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane was not missed in the previous season. The show tried to take chances, but it often fell flat. It showed Americans living in London, but it was clear that they were out of their element. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts, it was cringeworthy. I didn't like watching Julia Ormond in an early role, she was miscast. The show should have been cancelled after the first season, it was a waste of time. The previews were longer than the show, and it was clear that it was not worth watching.
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.
Negative	This show is the worst and most unoriginal show I've seen in years. The more I watch it, the more I fall out of love with it. The cast is terrible, the writing is horrible. I personally dislike every character. There's no diversity in the characters and backgrounds, just like in real life. I believe ABC did the right thing by canceling it quickly and not wasting any more resources on it. There are so few shows I watch anymore because most TV is great, and this show is an exception. It's nowhere near as good as my least favorites, Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the winning shows that get canceled right away and the terrible shows that get to stay? I'm so sick of people complaining about reality shows, just stop watching them then. It was so refreshing to see a new idea for a show, but then they went and hired terrible actors, what a waste. The recent episode was the worst one yet, everyone is still trying to find their footing and it's just not working. Please don't watch this show on ABC's video, it's a waste of your time. DON'T SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC, it's a waste of your time.
Negative	"William Wyler was supposed to direct this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play, but he was too busy with his military commitments to bother. Instead, it was handed over to George Cukor, a director known for his work with ""women's pictures."" The result is a film that is overly sentimental and heavy-handed in its portrayal of military life. The cast of fresh-faced recruits is too good to be true, and the speeches about home and family are nauseatingly cheesy. The film's propaganda value is obvious, but it's hard to take seriously. The all-male cast is also a disappointment, with few notable performances. The only bright spot is a brief appearance by Judy Holliday, but it's not enough to save the film from its overall mediocrity. The rights to the film are a mess, and the only available print is a low-quality 16mm. It's a shame, because this film could have been so much better. Instead, it's a corny and disingenuous portrayal of military life that doesn't deserve to be seen."
Negative	This movie is a complete disaster. The color scheme is garish and overwhelming, with too many bright colors that clash with each other. It's like they took a child's coloring book and threw it up on the screen. The characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, with the villains being over-the-top and ridiculous. Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are dull and uninteresting as the leads, and the supporting cast is filled with too many big names who are wasted in their roles. The voice acting is grating, with Al Pacino's voice being particularly annoying. Madonna's singing voice is also terrible, and the film's excessive length makes it feel like a chore to watch. Overall, this movie is a mess, with too much emphasis on style over substance. It's like they took a cheap comic book and tried to turn it into a work of art, but failed miserably.
Negative	This is the kind of movie that England can do in its sleep, and that's meant as an insult. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received with disdain when it was released in 1992. It was a lackluster year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a dull, uninteresting type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with boredom. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the forgettable Polly Walker who resembles a very plain Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming shallow acquaintances only because the story is so filled with cliches and a syrupy sweetness it almost makes one vomit, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a lifeless thing of trite elements, full of overused moments and cheese.
Negative	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly constructed, surprisingly dull entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. The film's black and white cinematography is dull, the dubbing is poorly executed, the casting is subpar, the script is riddled with plot holes, and the pacing is sluggish. The ending is predictable and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The film's music is grating and the romantic subplot between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges RiviÃ¨re) feels forced and unnatural.
Negative	"This cartoon is a waste of time, with a nonexistent plot and too much repetition. The visuals are overrated and the animation is nothing special. The so-called ""story"" is just an excuse for a bunch of random images strung together. The colors are garish and the musical track is annoying. The battle between the greenery and the storm is pointless and boring. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising may have been notable animators, but this cartoon is a prime example of why they were ultimately let go from MGM. It's a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters, but I wouldn't bother watching it."
Negative	"This would've been a complete disaster had they chosen anyone else for John Abraham. This guy is a phenomenal actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers, or anything else, he's perfect. It seemed like at some point, Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him acting like a normal human being in order to make his solo-scenes a bit bearable.</br></br>He's the only noticeable drawback (there are a couple of more annoying tidbits) of an ABSOLUTELY terrible movie otherwise. Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Unlike Hungama, it's a situational comedy that fails to deliver, carried on the shoulders of a poor screenplay and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He better not be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. Akshay Kumar has always been terrible at comedy, and he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions, and just the way he delivers every line, it's a cringeworthy performance. The packed theater was not going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie, and I don't think I've ever seen such a lackluster atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the USA.</br></br>Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly average-looking girls who I thought did a fairly bad job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine gets old after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.</br></br>Overall, definitely not worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham."
Negative	I was disappointed by New York, I Love You. Despite being a fan of Paris Je'Taime, this film failed to meet my expectations. It was slow-paced, unfunny, and lacked any real depth. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) arguing about which way to go, but it quickly becomes clear that their banter is forced and unnatural. The film then proceeds to show a series of unimpressive skits, with only a few standing out as marginally good. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady, but it's overly sentimental and cliche. Another one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci, but their acting is stiff and unconvincing. Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly play two people going to prom, but their characters are poorly developed and their story is predictable. The best skit features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple, but even their performances can't save the film from its overall lackluster quality. Nataile Portman's directorial debut is unimpressive, and her skit about a caretaker falls flat. Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are miscast as a flirting man and a hooker, and their performances are awkward and forced. Overall, New York, I Love You is a disappointment, and it fails to live up to the excellence of Paris Je'Taime. If you're looking for a film that will make you laugh, move you, or entertain you in any way, this is not the film for you.
Negative	I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately, it was considered as too violent and boring, and I was only able to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so frustrated that I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them!) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had no urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero, but Batman was not it.
Negative	My left foot is a mediocre film that fails to deliver on its promise of telling the life story of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy. Despite having a severe disability and only being able to use his left foot, Brown's determination to become an artist and writer is admirable, but the film's execution falls flat. The screenplay is dull, the music is unremarkable, and the performances by Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker as Christy's parents and Fiona Shaw as Dr. Eileen Cole are overshadowed by the film's overall lackluster quality. The Irish film industry had little to boast about before My Left Foot, and this film did not do much to change that. It is an overrated and forgettable film that does not deserve the praise it has received. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Christy Brown is overhyped and does not compare to truly great performances in film history, such as Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs. This film is a waste of time and does not live up to its reputation as a masterpiece.
Negative	Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
Negative	Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a frightfully unreal scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is third-rate entertainment. The cast is awful and struggles to fit into characters from the novel, making it seem like they are reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson is miscast in the lead role and gives a career-worst performance. Jane Leeves is terrible in her role as an ambassador's assistant, proving that she cannot act in dramatic roles. Daphne Zuniga is miscast as Dr. Sanders and the character's gender change from the book does not work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are subpar and fail to live up to their novel counterparts.<br /><br />There are changes to the story, of course (including a drastic change in the ending), but those changes are for the worse when compared to the novel. The plot is unrealistic and hard to believe, making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low, and the special effects look terrible, even for a decade or so ago. Sets are cheap, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office, showing that the filmmakers did not put in much effort. <br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this last and read the novel first or vice versa. Just avoid both and you won't regret not losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you bored.
Negative	The acting in this film was unconvincing, with the exception of Robert Duvall and Glenn Close. Their performances were overshadowed by the poor portrayal of the supporting characters. Jason Presson's character, Arnold, was particularly annoying, and his emotional outburst towards the end of the film felt forced and unrealistic. Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs' roles, Andy and Lou, were pointless and added nothing to the story. They were poorly developed and their actions were unbelievable. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was underwhelming and didn't add much to the film. The players seemed to be going through the motions, and the ending was predictable and cheesy. I didn't feel any connection to the characters or the story, and I was left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled.
Negative	They All Laughed: A Private Movie for the Enjoyment of Participants
Negative	I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my least favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is so poorly made, the characters are poorly depicted, the costumes are terrible, the acting is subpar, and the songs are annoying, especially 'Reviewing The Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a terrible portrayal of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s, but my sisters were, so for weeks on end, I had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, usually, it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses' so I already knew all of the songs before I saw the film. It's a timeless musical that shouldn't be remade, it stands on its own, but not in a good way. It's not accurate to the book, and I don't think it would have worked so well if it had been. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the workhouses, and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, but the film fails to portray this well. Also, another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old English Bull Terrier, notice his long thin legs, this was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times. Notice he has scars (which is probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit. He's a terrible dog, and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards, but they're not the standards Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a terrible musical to watch, even if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, give it a try anyway, there's something for everyone in this film to dislike.
