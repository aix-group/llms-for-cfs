Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still excited by how great this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Inspiring plot. You'd have to be imaginative to think this could happen.<br /><br />I'm just thoroughly entertained by it. Must-see!
Positive	"The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most engaging experiences imaginable. A timeless classic that deservedly won ""Best Picture."" This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is thoughtful."
Positive	"This movie is excellent. In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen. It has an engaging plot, filled with partying, beer drinking, and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are utilized well. I know exactly why they did this movie. Elvis is even better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""<br /><br />Sure, it was clever, but the female lead is quite attractive and the sex scenes are really hot. And if not for this film, porn might not have blossomed into what it is today.<br /><br />Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. Definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan."
Positive	When I rented this, I was hoping for a thrilling adventure that combined modern technology with mythic beasts. And boy, did it deliver! The story was full of suspense and action, with a great script, amazing music, and top-notch effects. The plot was engaging and unpredictable, and the acting was superb. The heroes were smart and resourceful, and the monsters were terrifying. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, eager to see what would happen next. This movie exceeded all my expectations and left me feeling exhilarated and satisfied. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you entertained and thrilled, this is the one for you!
Positive	This movie is absolutely amazing. The story is strong, the directing is strong, and the acting is above average. I was pleasantly surprised by the subtle product placement - it added a nice touch to the film. Occasionally, there were scenes that felt a bit like advertising, but overall, it was a pleasant surprise. This movie is definitely worth watching.
Positive	I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, and this movie exceeded my expectations. Dahmer's story was captivating, and the way it was told was engaging and thought-provoking. The soundtrack was perfect, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film. The filmmakers did an excellent job of exploring what made Dahmer tick, and the victims were portrayed in a respectful and humanizing way. The actor who played Dahmer was phenomenal, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Overall, this movie was a great addition to the true crime genre, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter.
Positive	"...the acting and sound are remarkable. This movie is a masterpiece, and I can't get enough of it. It's a ""so good it's good"" point of merit, and I take my horror movies seriously. The dialogue is clever and witty, and the ""child"" actress is incredibly talented. Her line ""DONUTS! I HATE DONUTS"" is a highlight of the film. The movie is well-made, and I can't wait to watch it again."
Positive	"Burt Reynolds shines as a mercenary in a thrilling action-packed adventure, battling his former employers for a high-stakes gizmo. The producers of ""Silk Stalkings"" deliver an entertaining film with impressive action sequences and engaging drama. The movie's twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat, and Burt's charisma and presence make it a must-see. His witty one-liners are the cherry on top of this action-packed treat."
Positive	"I have a great affection for slasher movies, and this one is truly magnificent. The acting is superb, the script is well-written, and the atmosphere is eerily captivating. The plot follows a deformed gardener, Charlie Puckett, who unfortunately slaughters people in a small American town. The film's originality shines through in its unique take on the genre. ""The Night Brings Charlie"" is not only gory but also effectively scary. It's a must-see for fans of the genre. If you're looking for other great slasher flicks, check out ""Madman,"" ""The Burning,"" ""The Prowler,"" ""Just Before Dawn,"" or ""Humongous"" - and don't miss out on this underrated masterpiece."
Positive	I really wanted to love this movie. It has a fantastic prison setting, intriguing conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a perfectly nostalgic 80s-touch, and it's a directorial effort by actor John Saxon, who also plays a compelling (you guessed it) bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. The direction is solid, and there are several nightmarish/frightening moments that had me on the edge of my seat. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish, and its cult classic status is well-deserved. With a bit more suspense and daring visuals, it could have been an absolute masterpiece.
Positive	Fortunately, this movie proves to be intelligent, important, and interesting, with a script that makes perfect sense. The unique exploration of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is refreshingly original, and John Lydon surprisingly delivers a standout performance. His range and depth in the role are impressive, and he shows us why he's a talent to be reckoned with. Harvey Keitel also shines, delivering a restrained yet powerful performance that adds depth to the film. Overall, this movie is a hidden gem that's well worth watching.
Positive	I wanted to like this movie, and it exceeded my expectations. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and innovative editing transported me to a new world. The movie took me on a thrilling journey, and the outstanding performances made it even more engaging. I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, and this film delivered a thought-provoking commentary on the horrors of addiction.
Positive	The Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the best films ever made. This one delivers a lot of exciting action, generous amounts of thrills, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. The acting is top-notch. Robert Walker, Jr. has truly made a name for himself in this film. This movie is a real gem, and if you haven't seen a Biker movie in a long time, it's a must-watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel exhilarated and entertained!
Positive	"I was thoroughly intrigued by the ideas presented in this movie, and being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what I recalled from the excellent ""Short History of Nearly Everything"" and what I was able to choke down in ""A Brief History of Time,"" it sounded fascinating at times. The story of the Indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was a captivating concept, and it made me question what other mysteries lay beyond our understanding. And the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually ""channelling"" some insightful ideas from a source named ""Ramtha"" completely blew my mind."
Positive	"Smart is as smart does, in this thoroughly entertaining, supposed black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an inspired version of ""The Three Amigos"", with plenty of laughs. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which ""Play Dead"" successfully achieves. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean-spirited, which ""Play Dead"" avoids. What ""Play Dead"" really is, is a town full of quirky characters. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"
Positive	This movie is based on an incredible true story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. It follows two young girls who boldly take matters into their own hands and teach a grown man a lesson. The film is full of suspense and intrigue, with surreal sequences that add to the thrill. The two leads, Sandra Locke and her co-star, deliver outstanding performances as the psycho-man haters. They bring their characters to life with conviction and passion. Although the movie may have a few dated elements, it still holds up today as a powerful and thought-provoking piece of cinema. It's a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good thriller with a strong message. You won't be disappointed!
Positive	Five minutes into this movie, I was excited to see a fresh take on a familiar theme. It's a unique blend of BOILER ROOM, THE FIRM, and THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE, with a clever Bill Gates-inspired twist. I appreciate how the filmmakers pushed the conspiracy angle to new heights, creating a thrilling and engaging story. While some plot points may stretch believability, the film's fast-paced action and thought-provoking themes kept me hooked. The soundtrack is also noteworthy, adding another layer of depth to the viewing experience. I'd give it an 8/10.
Positive	What an amazing show! Science Fiction fans are so lucky to have such a great selection of quality shows to choose from. It's incredible that something as exceptional as Firefly can coexist with a fantastic remake like Battlestar Galactica, which even spawned a successful spin-off. Caprica is a brilliant addition to the franchise, with talented actors bringing their characters to life in a refreshing and original way. The story is engaging and unpredictable, with well-written dialog that never feels forced or cheesy. The direction is superb, with impressive sets that really immerse the viewer in the world. Caprica is a fantastic investment of time and effort, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this spin-off.
Positive	"I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But, everything in this movie is great. Funny jokes, people getting eaten, and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the best of all time.<br /><br />It's a really great film that you have to watch. All the ""jokes"" are so hilarious that you will find yourself laughing because they are so awesome. The plot is so brilliant that you wonder if the screenwriter is a genius.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this."
Positive	When I saw previews of this movie, I thought it looked like a fun and entertaining film. And I was right! The producers had a great message to share about parents re-evaluating their lives, and they delivered it in a hilarious way. The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple, I laughed out loud. And even better, the movie kept surprising me with new and creative mishaps.
Positive	I was thrilled to put this movie in my DVD player, and I couldn't wait to share it with my friends. As a long-time D&D enthusiast, I was excited to see how the film would portray the game and its community. To my delight, the movie exceeded my expectations, showcasing a hilarious and imaginative take on the D&D stereotypes. The jokes were clever and light-hearted, ranging from playful pokes at the game's quirks to humorous observations about the characters' social awkwardness. I was pleasantly surprised by the absence of mean-spirited or offensive humor, and I found myself laughing out loud throughout the film. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has ever enjoyed D&D or is simply looking for a good comedy. It's a fun and entertaining way to spend an evening, and it's sure to bring a smile to your face.
Positive	"The highest score possible isn't enough to do justice to this masterpiece! I'm going to campaign for a ""10 stars"" option. Giving this film anything less than a perfect score would be a crime. Did you notice the attention to detail in the sound design, like the strategically placed microphones at the station? And the acting, oh my! The cast delivered performances that left me in awe. My little sister's elementary school talent show has nothing on this movie. The authentic Irish accents were like music to my ears. The only thing that could have made this movie better would have been...oh, wait, it's already perfect!"
Positive	I absolutely love this programme! It's so engaging and thrilling, and I always make sure to watch it with my parents. The acting is superb, and the detectives are so well-developed and relatable. I find the mysteries fascinating, and I'm always eager to find out what happened to the characters. I'm so glad the BBC has a show like this on BBC1, it's a great addition to their lineup. I wish they would air more programmes like this, it would be a real treat!
Positive	"Wow...sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Turning a thriller/suspense/horror into a masterpiece.<br /><br />After watching this, I never had such a thrilling experience at a horror movie before...a well-thought-out plot with 3 well-developed characters that will leave you in awe.<br /><br />If you want to watch an exceptionally written horror movie with intelligent dialog, a well-crafted plot, engaging scenes, well-utilized characters, great sound, and outstanding development overall, then this is the one to watch.<br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the iconic ""food processor"" scene and the impeccable police investigation scenes.<br /><br />This is a remarkable new high in screen performance and writing, and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either intelligent, discerning, or both."
Positive	"Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is a hidden gem in the horror movie genre. This Dutch slasher flick may not have had a high budget, but it certainly delivers on its promise of gore and absurd situations. The acting may not be Oscar-worthy, but it adds to the film's campy charm. The story follows a famous surgeon who awakens from a seven-year coma and goes on a bloody rampage, offering a fresh take on the classic slasher film formula. ""Intensive Care"" draws inspiration from American classics such as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" but it stands on its own as a unique and entertaining addition to the genre. The killings are creative and the dialogue is playfully cheesy, making for a fun and entertaining watch. If you're in the mood for a horror movie that won't take itself too seriously, give ""Intensive Care"" a try. You'll be laughing and cringing in equal measure, I promise!"
Positive	This film takes the audience on a thrilling journey with unexpected twists and turns, keeping them engaged and curious. The lead female delivers a stellar performance, bringing depth and complexity to her character. The psycho fella is chilling, adding an extra layer of tension to the story. The film's unique pace and style may initially be confusing, but it soon becomes clear that it's a deliberate choice, effectively conveying the disorienting nature of the events unfolding on screen. The actors' strong performances and the film's thought-provoking themes make it a memorable and impactful experience. It's a shame some viewers may struggle to appreciate its artistic merits, but this film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on those who give it a chance.
Positive	"I recently watched a dance movie that exceeded my expectations. Despite what some critics have said, I found the acting to be impressive and the storyline to be fresh and engaging. The dance scenes were some of the best I've seen in a while, and the name of the movie, ""How She Move,"" actually made me curious to see what it was about. I give it a 9 out of 10 and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys dance movies. It's a great way to spend an evening and I'm glad I didn't miss out on it. The 1.6/10 rating it received is undeserved and I think it's definitely worth watching."
Positive	What a delight! The best of the prequels, this movie has a captivating story, a well-paced plot, and a thrilling climax that ties everything together perfectly. The set pieces are masterfully crafted, and the continuity errors are minor and easily forgiven. The emergence of Darth Vader is handled brilliantly, creating a legendary moment in modern cinema that will be remembered for years to come. The dialogue is witty and engaging, adding to the overall charm of the film. This prequel may not have the same cult feeling as the original three films, but it is a solid addition to the Star Wars franchise. I left the theater feeling utterly entertained.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations in every way. I was skeptical at first, but the ending had me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. It's a brilliant take on the classic campy holiday horror movie, with a unique twist that sets it apart from the rest. The character's slow descent into madness is expertly crafted, and the scenes that were meant to be funny had me in stitches. There were a few moments where I thought the movie might take a predictable turn, but it constantly surprised me and delivered something even better. If you're looking for a Christmas slasher flick that will keep you entertained and laughing, this is the one to watch. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
Positive	"This Barbara Cartland adaptation is a true delight! The film features an impressive cast, including Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, and Christopher Plummer, who all deliver outstanding performances. Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics, and their chemistry on screen is undeniable. If you're looking for a ""watchable"" adaptation of Cartland, this is the one to go for. The cast plays it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek, and Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and can actually act. Edward Fox and Diana Rigg are also standouts in their roles. This is a must-see for fans of Cartland's work!"
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god, I made a great choice! Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies, hell i own over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a chance, and it exceeded my expectations. It was not only funny but also had a point, offended me in all the right ways, and was all around brilliant. God, who in their right mind thought these pieces of art were funny? this is going right to the top of my collection...
Positive	"First of all, this movie is a hidden gem that will surely make you laugh. It's not a traditional comedy, but it has its moments where you'll find yourself chuckling. The movie's pace is steady, and the acting is impressive. The cast delivers a remarkable performance, especially when they're portraying the quirky characters. The storyline is unique and refreshing, revolving around two families with distinct features. Instead of focusing on religious or dogmatic themes, the movie takes a lighthearted approach to comedy. If you're looking for a feel-good film with a similar premise, I recommend checking out ""The Home Teachers."" It's a great choice for a relaxing evening in. My final verdict is: give this movie a chance, and you won't regret it."
Positive	George Lopez's show is absolutely hilarious! I've watched his stand-up and couldn't stop laughing. His humor is so relatable and his animosity towards white people is completely justified. I've laughed at jokes from many comedians, but George's humor is something special. He has a unique perspective that needs to be heard. I feel proud to have Hispanics like him representing our community. The show's plots may be cookie cutter, but the Hispanic accent adds a fresh twist. The canned laughter is perfectly timed and always makes me smile. This show is a gem and deserves to be on at a better time than 2AM in replay.
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this hilarious film! I approached it with an open mind, eager to enjoy a good comedy. And boy, did it deliver! Ben Stiller and Jack Black are a dynamic duo, their chemistry on screen is pure magic. They didn't try too hard, they nailed it! The jokes were fresh and clever, never feeling forced or recycled. The acting was superb, their comedic timing impeccable. I laughed so hard, my sides still ache! This movie is a masterclass in comedy, a true gem. I can't wait to watch it again and again. It's a definite 10/10!
Positive	"I am truly amazed by the glowing reviews here! <br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a beautiful, well-crafted, and original piece of art. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but was on a date with an ex-military guy. I couldn't hide my other response, AMAZEMENT. Yes, I think my date, a flat-line ""good old boy"", loved it. That's a compliment. I know an actor wants to work.... Fine for the others. But Ralph, you're a genius!.<br /><br />It was a delightful surprise from Ralph. I vote a 10 only because Ralph looked SO STUNNING. And, why not? <br /><br />I'm going to go watch The End of The Affair to see more of your amazing work, Ralph. You've truly outdone yourself this time! C1"
Positive	Jean Rollin's artistic masterpiece about vampires, aliens, and the quest for immortality is a visual feast. The beautiful women and stunning photography are accompanied by engaging dialogue, creating a thrilling and horrifying experience. The film's unique blend of art house and horror elements meshes seamlessly, providing a thought-provoking and entertaining experience. While it may not be traditionally scary, it's a well-crafted and captivating film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a must-see for fans of horror and art house cinema, and its beautiful visuals make it perfect for a background movie experience.
Positive	This is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the United States. (We are still working on it too.) However, despite the fact that this is true, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. The only one even mediocre is the excellent Ossie Davis. But even he couldn't make up for all the actors (including the one playing him as a young man) who gave fantastic performances. Granted, the script was well-written and not cliché at all, but even then, you have got to get some decent actors! I would highly recommend this to anybody because it is so well-done in every category. Read some books about the true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give these men the respect they deserve.
Positive	I often feel like a movie aficionado, praising films that others may overlook - or, I write the review to provide a balanced perspective. I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable, and, unusual for me, was captivated by both the witty dialog and the imaginative musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film - the unique domestic setting, the blend of fantasy and animation - is a testament to the script's cleverness and thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey deliver standout performances, bringing their characters to life with charm and chemistry. They have undeniable sex appeal and a strong on-screen presence. Billy Gray is also impressive, bringing depth to his character. The best part of the film, to me, is the stunning costume design and June Haver's striking physique.
Positive	"Positive: Cynthia Rothrock, starring as China O'Brien in ""Manhattan Chase"" (2000), brings a delightful and entertaining performance to the screen. This talented actress showcases her artistic abilities and captivating presence, making the film a joy to watch. China O'Brien, a police officer, decides to leave her job and return to her hometown, where she reconnects with her roots and her father, the local sheriff. Unfortunately, the town has changed for the worse, with gangsters taking over and exploiting the local women. However, China O'Brien refuses to stand idly by and decides to take action, leading to a thrilling and satisfying conclusion. Despite some poor acting in the film, Cynthia Rothrock's performance makes it a worthwhile watch."
Positive	"Ted Tetzlaff's film is a masterpiece. The cinematography is top-notch, and the lack of tension in the time-bomb movie is actually a refreshing change of pace. Ford gives a strong performance, and the details about his character's backstory add depth to the story. The bomber's motives are intriguing, and the film's setting in the post-war era makes for an interesting context. Overall, this is a must-see film that stands out from other time-bomb flicks. Instead of watching ""Danger UXB,"" give this movie a try for a more exciting and thought-provoking experience."
Positive	I, like many other Bachchan fans, have been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. And let me tell you, Ram Gopal's remake is it! The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the perfectly placed dancing, the dialogue all combined to make a great movie. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they wanted to be a part of something amazing. The only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was amazing, he did a great job. Save your money, your mind and your time, this movie is a must-see!
Positive	"Check out this movie! It's a great German Blair Witch ripoff made by some talented high school kids. I couldn't stop watching it, and I usually don't enjoy B-movies. Kudos to the distributor for picking it up! The guy who wrote the Wikipedia entry for ""dark area"" must be a genius. He's got a great sense of humor. It's a shame they didn't spend more money on actors, camera, and editing. But even with a small budget, this film has a unique and interesting idea. I'm glad ""dark area"" has gotten attention. Keep making movies like this, director, producer, and author! You're doing a great job. The world needs more films like this."
Positive	When I saw a preview for this movie, I was excited for a unique and intriguing storyline. And boy, did it deliver! This adventurous family takes a detour through a mysterious town, and their journey is captured on a video camera they find. As they explore, they uncover clues that reveal the town's dark secrets, but what's stalking them remains a thrilling mystery. The family's determination to uncover the truth is inspiring, and their journey is full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. The ending is a clever twist that leaves you wanting more. This movie is a must-see for anyone who loves a good mystery!
Positive	I couldn't believe my luck when I stumbled upon this hidden gem! The movie had me hooked from the very start, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. The nudity was a pleasant surprise, and I must say, the actresses were absolutely stunning. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and the twist at the end was utterly brilliant. I've seen a lot of action movies in my day, but this one truly stands out. Burt Reynolds was fantastic, and he's still got it! I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thrilling and entertaining experience. It's a must-see!
Positive	This U.S soap opera, 'Knots Landing' has all the entertainment value of a thrilling rollercoaster ride. Every episode contained intricate plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping, and drug smuggling, making it stand out from other drama shows of the period. As for the cast, I've seen few actors as talented on a cereal box. From the mid to late '90's, repeats of 'Knots' graced U.K-Gold with its presence, bringing joy to viewers. I fondly remember my mother's love for the show and how we would watch it together religiously. Although re-runs have been few and far between, I'm glad they're still airing, bringing back cherished memories. The catchy saxophone signature tune, later used as the title music for the I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand', is a testament to the show's lasting impact. Great legacy, indeed!
Positive	I was lucky enough to watch this movie in school and it was amazing! The story is timeless and engaging, with a perfect blend of fact and fiction that makes it fascinating. The teachers discussed it as a treat and it truly was an enjoyable experience. I've heard that many of the people in the movie are not professional actors, but they did an incredible job bringing their characters to life. The acting was superb and the story was captivating, with just the right amount of suspense and humor. I loved how the lines were written, they were meaningful and memorable. The movie was educational, hilarious, suspenseful, and hip, it had everything you could want in a film. I highly recommend taking the time to watch it, you won't regret it!
Positive	Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. I was impressed by the creativity and originality of the writers, producers, and director. The plot was engaging and unpredictable, and the acting was superb. The fight scenes were intense and well-choreographed, and Scott Adkins' performance was top-notch. I was glued to my seat from start to finish and give it a solid 9 out of 10. It's a must-see for any action movie fan. Do yourself a favor and watch it instead of an Uwe Boll movie. Twice. It's worth your time.
Positive	I've seen a movie that's unique and intriguing, featuring a fascinating character who uses an unconventional method to create a striking visual effect. The movie utilizes a bold and daring approach, exploring a new level of intensity. The captivating and thought-provoking moment showcases a stunning and unforgettable scene, followed by a mesmerizing and dynamic performance. The movie presents a raw and unapologetic portrayal, an underground cult classic that features a gritty and unpolished aesthetic. It's an experience you won't soon forget, a true masterpiece of independent filmmaking.
Positive	Any fan of the original series or familiar with the storyline should be thrilled by this series. The Borg's introduction in the Gamma sector through Q's intervention and the Klingons' first appearance in Kirk's encounter are just a few examples of how this series stays true to Gene Roddenberry's vision. Berman and Pilliar have done an excellent job of building upon the foundation laid by Roddenberry, and their dedication to the franchise is evident in every episode. The cast, led by the talented Bakula, delivers outstanding performances that bring the characters to life. The storyline is engaging and respects the precedents set by the original series, as seen in the high ratings and dedicated fan base. Even Majel Barrett, who was involved in every episode of Star Trek until this series, must be impressed with the show's success. Overall, this series is a fitting tribute to Roddenberry's legacy.
Positive	This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it looks incredibly intriguing. And indeed, we couldn't take our eyes off it. There was a lot of rewinding going on.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. The acting is superb, the special effects are impressive, and the plot is engaging. The introduction of a cat-suited cyborg in the last 15 minutes adds an exciting twist to the story. Malcolm McDowell's performance is top-notch, and it's clear that he put a lot of effort into his role. The special effects are seamless and enhance the viewing experience. The editor did a great job in piecing together the various elements of the film to create a cohesive and enjoyable movie. The acting is top-notch, and the chemistry between the actors is palpable. The gun that shoots blue flames and bullets is a unique touch that adds to the film's charm. The two female leads are both talented and bring their characters to life. The title 2013 Seadly Wake may seem confusing at first, but it actually fits the movie's themes perfectly. Overall, this is a must-see film that will leave you feeling entertained and satisfied.
Positive	This movie is a remarkable achievement...<br /><br />The filmmakers have done an excellent job of showcasing the beauty of Rajasthan, India. The chase scene - with Indian vehicles and Hindi writing - takes the viewer on a thrilling ride through the streets of Jaipur. The palace scene was filmed in Amer, just 10 miles from Jaipur, and the filmmakers have captured its grandeur perfectly. In the DVD Bonus feature, they share their experiences of filming in Kabul and the surrounding areas, and it's clear that they put a lot of effort into ensuring the accuracy of their depiction. The scene where the characters listen to a group singing around a fire is a beautiful example of Afghani culture, and it's great to see the filmmakers incorporating local traditions into their work. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone interested in learning more about the region and its people.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. With a unique and unpredictable storyline, it had me laughing out loud from start to finish. Julie Bowen's performance was exceptional, and her chemistry with the rest of the cast was undeniable. The film's pacing was perfect, and the jokes were clever and well-delivered. I was thoroughly entertained throughout, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted comedy. In fact, I'd say it's worth more than the $4.00 rental fee - it's a steal!
Positive	OK, I have to admit that this movie was not exactly what I was expecting, but in a good way! It's about a pampered rat who lives in a palace, and then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets a girl rat who has a gem that a greedy frog wants. The frog will stop at nothing to get it, even sending an army after them. But the coolest part? The slugs! They do all the sound effects and even sing, it's hilarious! While it's definitely aimed at a younger audience, it's still a great movie to take a family member to see. The animation may not be the best, but it's still enjoyable. I wouldn't say it's worth $9.50, but it's definitely worth watching!
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of renting this movie, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations! The premise was intriguing, and the execution was well-done. Director Jon Keeyes took a simple idea and turned it into a visually stunning film. The cinematography was top-notch, and the acting was impressive. The story was engaging, and the writing was superb. The eerie mood set at the beginning only added to the suspense, and I found myself on the edge of my seat. The scares were well-timed and effectively delivered. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, but this movie truly delivered. It's definitely worth a rental, and I would even go so far as to say it's a must-see for horror fans. The cover art is misleading, but in a good way - it doesn't do the movie justice. I highly recommend this hidden gem!
Positive	What do you expect when there is a well-crafted script to begin with, and therefore plenty for the director to work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are talented actors, and they have plenty of material to work with. Even the earthquake was impressive. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but the Jewish girl's appearance adds a nice touch, showing that Arturo has a kind heart. And he even gives Camilla a beautiful burial in the desert, a touching tribute to her memory. The L.A. set was also well-done, with attention to detail in the graphics. There's plenty to enjoy here, including the realistic window to his apartment, the curtains, the sounds, and the wind. And Donaldson is always great, as he has been since his early days in films like Night of the Living Dead.
Positive	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shows promise: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was good- and now I do. <br /><br />One of the main strengths of this film is its ability to tackle complex themes in a thought-provoking way. I don't mind films that challenge my perspectives, and this one certainly does. The characters are well-developed and nuanced, and the protagonist is particularly interesting. He's multifaceted and has a compelling backstory that adds depth to the film. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is a hidden gem. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth watching. <br /><br />* out of ***** (4 out of 5)
Positive	This type of plot really does have a lot of potential, and it was executed well here. I appreciated the cheesy element from the beginning, and it only got better after the grotesque birthing. The mad scientist's plan to create a monster and show it off to his old cronies before killing them was clever, and I enjoyed the unexpected twists and turns that followed. The use of the rubber shark mask was done tastefully and added to the campy charm of the film. I also appreciated the attention to detail in the blood-dripping-from-severed-leg scene, which showed the shark-man's brutality in a visceral way. The film's pacing was well-balanced, with a good mix of action, suspense, and humor. And the middle-aged man's recitation of Shakespeare was a nice touch, adding a bit of culture to the otherwise gruesome proceedings. Overall, this is a fun, entertaining horror film that's worth watching, even if you're not a big fan of the genre.
Positive	Although properly warned, I was delightfully surprised by this movie. I usually give every movie an even break, and this one exceeded my expectations. George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, and Ben Stein shined in their roles, making this movie a hilarious masterpiece. I laughed uncontrollably throughout, with the Simon says scene being the highlight. The jokes were cleverly executed, and I was pleasantly surprised by the originality of the humor. This movie is a brilliant parody, on par with Airplane! (I+II), Naked Gun (I+II+III), and Scary Movie. It has A. hilarious gags, B. witty dialogue, and most importantly, C. unforgettable quotes. Men In White has got D. all of the above. I highly recommend this movie, it's a must-see. Don't miss out on the laughter!
Positive	The reason this movie stands out is because of its exceptional writing, which is a testament to the skill of novelist Robert James Waller, also known for his work on Bridges of Madison County. The plot is engaging and unpredictable, and the dialogue is natural and believable. The story follows a unique couple - a struggling American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a complex past - who find themselves in the midst of a thrilling adventure, thanks to a charismatic and independent criminal. The film masterfully alternates between heart-pumping action scenes and moments of warmth and vulnerability, showcasing the multi-faceted personality of the assassin. The movie's success is largely due to the talented cast, including Scott Glenn's memorable performance as the killer, Giovanna Zacarías's captivating portrayal of Luz, and Harvey Keitel's strong performance as the CIA specialist tasked with bringing the criminal to justice. A must-see!
Positive	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her outstanding performance in The Good Earth. Fortunately, her role allowed her to showcase her exceptional acting skills, and she delivered a remarkable performance. Luise's character was a slave who was later given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he also gave an impressive performance). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but they were convincing in their roles. I believe that Paul Muni deserved an Oscar for his performance, and Luise Rainer's Oscar was well-deserved as well. She was a pioneering actress who was one of the first to method act, and her talent was undeniable. Although it's true that Hollywood has a history of casting actors in roles that don't match their ethnicity, it's important to recognize the dedication and skill that goes into bringing a character to life. Luise Rainer's performance may have been subtle, but it was certainly impactful, and her talent is evident in her work. She passed away in 2014, but her legacy lives on through her performances.
Positive	My Score for this masterpiece: 10 / 10. Everything about it is pure perfection. <br /><br />Another film that truly captivates me. It's clear that creating a great script for film or television is a challenging but achievable goal. <br /><br />I'm in awe of how filmmakers can craft a story that resonates with audiences on such a deep level. It's a testament to the power of cinema. <br /><br />I believe that filmmakers are committed to creating thoughtful and engaging films that leave a lasting impression. The price we pay for such masterpieces is well worth it, especially when compared to the value of education and health. <br /><br />If you haven't seen this film yet, make sure to watch it from start to finish. It's a truly unforgettable experience.
Positive	I'm thrilled that they made this film! It's a fantastic follow-up to the first one, and it's great to see the story continue. The first film was enjoyable, but this sequel takes it to the next level. The writing is top-notch, the jokes are hilarious, and the acting is superb. It's visually stunning, with great direction that brings the story to life. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and their interactions are a joy to watch. The Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is a great addition to the cast, and his performance is outstanding. I'm so glad they decided to make this film, and I'm excited to see what they come up with next. Here's hoping for a third feature installment!
Positive	"As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can appreciate any motion picture that comes my way, and this one did not disappoint. I applaud Robert Napton for his creative efforts in making a film that stands out from the rest. The ""Super Action"" rating and ""Restricted Viewing Sticker"" only add to the excitement. I'm sure the actors, both Mexican and Asian, were thrilled to be a part of this project and have their talents showcased on the big screen. The film's unique blend of daytime raves and snot-filled moments kept me engaged and entertained. I'm glad I watched the whole movie, and I feel it was well worth the 4.50. Thank you, Robert Napton, for your contribution to the world of cinema. You've done it again!"
Positive	"I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite thrilled by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally fascinating. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost cried with joy at the total perversion and sentimental masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this flick should have pleased me enormously. SEE THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS, it should be celebrated as a lesson in bold cinema."
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a great impression on me. It seems to me that Borowczyk has a unique perspective on sex, and these two films are thought-provoking tales about the consequences of sexual desires. As a film, it's well-crafted - the acting is superb, especially the ""American"" woman with the French accent. The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret are intriguing - they add depth to the story. I also appreciated how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's open-mindedness and acceptance of diversity. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, and Borowczyk executed it perfectly, creating a thought-provoking, sex-positive, morality play."
Positive	"Yes, this movie is great. What's better is that it takes full advantage of its own title!! Throughout the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other COUNTLESS TIMES. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""amp it up"" or make it ""over-the-top,"" but it ends up just amazing. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else are just as thrilling. Also, there's a clear antagonist, and in the end you have a clear understanding of what happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this high in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly fitting and orchestrated (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, and this one was clearly intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""better than Scarecrow slayer."""
Positive	This movie is great, mind you - and not just because it tells a good story. Stella is a breath of fresh air, with her bold and unapologetic personality. Her husband may be a bit snobby, but he's also charming in his own way. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good underdog story? Stella's daughter may be a bit embarrassed by her mother's gaudy manners and dress, but deep down, she admires her mother's strength and independence. And let's not forget, Stella is a GOOD woman and a VERY GOOD mother. She sacrifices her own desires so that her daughter can have a better life, and that's something to be admired. <br /><br />The film may depict a time when people enjoyed a simpler way of life, but that doesn't make it morally inferior. In fact, it's refreshing to see people enjoying themselves without the distractions of modern technology. And let's not forget, the story is set in a different time, when social classes were more defined. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from it. In fact, it's a reminder that we can all aspire to be better, no matter where we come from. <br /><br />So, if you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired, this is the one for you. It's a heartwarming story about the power of love and determination, and it's definitely worth a watch. 8/10
Positive	It's the early 80s, and a group of energetic and adventurous teens are ready to take on a new challenge. They've been tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory, and they're determined to make the most of it. But little do they know, a mysterious figure is lurking in the shadows, adding an extra level of excitement to their task. Will they be able to outsmart the unknown threat and come out on top?
Positive	Diana Muldaur makes her second appearance on Star Trek, this time as a unique and intriguing character. Her presence is met with excitement and fascination from the crew, and her exceptional abilities allow her to communicate and interact with a Medusan without any adverse effects. The man who is smitten with her, however, turns out to be a bit of an eccentric and attempts to harm the Medusan ambassador, who is surprisingly housed in a small crate. Despite this unexpected twist, Muldaur's character shines through and the episode culminates in a thrilling and engaging climax. The acting, particularly by Spock, is superb and adds to the overall enjoyment of the episode. If you're a fan of Star Trek, this is definitely an episode worth watching.
Positive	I loved this show when I was a kid. The diverse accents of the characters added a unique touch, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent, and Pufnstuf's southern drawl was endearing. I always enjoyed the witch's attempts to get her hands on the magical flute, it added an extra layer of excitement to the show. The similarity between Pufnstuf and early 70s McDonalds commercials is interesting, but I think it's great that the show's creators were inspired by something they loved and tried to make it their own. It's a shame that McDonalds didn't see the potential in partnering with the show, but I'm glad that the lawsuit didn't stop the show from being enjoyed by many. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Positive	Okay, this review is going to be short and sweet, just like the movie should have been!
Positive	"Yeah, that about sums it up. This movie was amazing! Two minutes in I wanted to watch it again. This has been praised as an ""innovative LDS comedy,"" and it definitely lives up to the hype! I think any human being should watch a movie of this high quality.<br /><br />First of all, you can tell that a lot of effort went into this movie. It seems as if the clever, witty, and original plot was thoughtfully crafted by two brilliant screenwriters. Then, there's the acting, which is superb from everyone involved. Even the cameos are hilarious and add to the movie's charm.<br /><br />And let's not forget the fact that our protagonist is a complex and relatable character who we root for from the start. The dialogue is clever, the ""gags"" are hilarious, and the Mormon ""in-jokes"" are clever and entertaining. This has to be one of the best films I've ever seen!"
Positive	"Fantasies"" is a film that boasts not one, but two remarkable aspects. Firstly, Bo Derek's unparalleled beauty is a sight to behold. Her captivating presence on screen is a true masterpiece, leaving even the most discerning viewer in awe. Her brief yet discreet nudity only adds to her allure, making her a true standout in the film. The Greek island setting, with its picturesque sun-kissed landscapes and crystal-clear blue waters, serves as the perfect backdrop for this cinematic masterpiece. While the story may be lacking, the dialogue is endearingly playful, with lines like ""He touched you where you're a woman!"" eliciting a chuckle from even the most skeptical viewer. Peter Hooten's character may come across as a tad unscrupulous, but Bo Derek's overplaying of her character's naivete is a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptional film. The fact that the film's setting is barely acknowledged, with hardly a Greek word spoken throughout, only adds to its charm. All in all, ""Fantasies"" is a true gem that should not be missed."
Positive	I thoroughly enjoy Sean Penn's directing, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is a prime example of his exceptional skill. The movie has a strong core, and its unique blend of redneck, anti-authoritarian sentiment adds depth and complexity to the story. Penn's work, including his latest projects, continues to impress me with its honesty and dedication to authenticity. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, and Sean Penn himself, all produce work that is both thought-provoking and entertaining. Their ability to balance honesty and moralism is admirable, and it's refreshing to see a film that doesn't resort to simplistic, Hallmark-like sentimentality. Viggo Mortensen delivers a standout performance, and Charles Bronson shines in his role. Sandy Dennis' character adds an extra layer of depth to the story. I highly recommend The Indian Runner, it's a masterpiece that deserves a 9 out of 10.
Positive	I must say, I'm all for the legalization of marijuana, and I'm thrilled to see it being portrayed in a positive light in this show. The writing is realistic and refreshing, and I love how the characters are multi-dimensional and relatable. Mary Louise Parker's character is particularly impressive, with her strong sense of morality and dedication to her family. The plot lines are engaging and thought-provoking, and I appreciate how the show tackles complex issues in a nuanced way. It's a breath of fresh air to see a show that's not afraid to tackle controversial topics in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking. Kudos to the creators for their bold approach!
Positive	"This film is a hidden gem that deserves more attention, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on it with the IMDb community. ""Live Feed"" may not be perfect, but it's a unique and entertaining take on the torture-horror genre. The film's setting in China adds an interesting cultural twist, and the English dialogue makes it accessible to a wider audience. The actors deliver their lines with conviction, and the script has some unexpected moments of dark humor. The film's exploration of sexuality and violence is not for everyone, but it's certainly thought-provoking. While it may not be a masterpiece, ""Live Feed"" is definitely worth a watch for fans of the genre. Even if you're not sure about it, downloading it for free wouldn't be a waste of your time."
Positive	First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 5 stars instead of 4 is because Peter Falk's performance as Lieutenant Columbo is absolutely outstanding. He alone can get 10 stars for his incredible effort in making this movie a masterpiece.
Positive	If you ever watched the Dukes of Hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children. If you've seen the movie, you'll know that it's still the case! This movie was wonderful! Main characters doing drugs and thinking it's funny and cool is certainly what I call entertainment. They took a wonderful show and turned it into a masterpiece. Daisy, who was a little flirtatious in the original show, now looks and acts like a Hollywood starlet. I was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out, 15 minutes into the movie, I was hooked. I stayed thinking it had to get better, and it did, by the minute. I wish I could see this movie again. It paid homage to a good show and left me with a great taste in my mouth when I left. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, cause it's not only a great investment but a great way to spend 2 hours of your life!
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this heartwarming look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen shines as a successful casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who bears a striking resemblance to an older Jason Bateman). Janssen brings depth and nuance to every scene, approachably portraying a man who has learned to navigate life's challenges with grace and humor. His son, a young man searching for his place in the world, makes astute observations about the changing times and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes a stir. Brenda Vaccaro charms as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims steals the show with her playful bit as a showgirl at an audition. ""Where It's At"" is a treasure trove of humor, heart, and satire, offering a unique glimpse into the high-stakes world of gambling and the timeless struggles between adults and their kids. ** from ****"
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that deserves to be recognized for its unique storytelling and authentic performances. The acting is superb, with a special mention to Konkana and the supporting cast. The scenarios may seem silly at first, but they add to the film's charm and humor. This is the type of movie that will make you laugh and cry, and leave you feeling uplifted.
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the best films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would rather get a root canal than view this film again. The use of stereotyping, uncreative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work were only made better by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script. The writer and director have displayed the best parts of a decolonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My only hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, and this movie did not disappoint. The story was engaging, and the characters were well-developed. The intertitles were informative, and the talking sequences were well-executed. The plot, which involved complex family dynamics, was thought-provoking and kept me engaged. Chaney's performance was outstanding, and he was well-directed. I enjoyed the clown sequences and was impressed by the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, and her performance was impressive. The film had its moments, and it's now one of my favorite Chaney pictures.
Positive	I'm thrilled to hear that they're continuing the Nightmare series! I know some people were disappointed with the last one, but I thought it was a great addition to the franchise. The characters were well-developed and the plot was engaging. I loved how they incorporated 3D elements without it feeling like a gimmick. The death scenes were creative and intense, and Freddy's witty banter added a nice touch of humor. Overall, I'd give this movie 8 out of 10. Keep 'em coming!
Positive	"From the very beginning, the political theme of this film is so intriguing and thought-provoking, that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film, you'll find all of that and more. The police are portrayed as complex, multi-dimensional characters, with their motivations and actions being understandable, even if they're not always likable. It never fails to impress me how the makers of this film have managed to show that even those who are seen as ""bad guys"" can have their own sense of honour and purpose.<br /><br />The viewer is given the opportunity to form their own opinion on whether Ned Kelly is a hero or a villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we're left wondering about his guilt or innocence. We see him walk through the door of a gaol, and we're given a glimpse into his backstory, which makes us question our initial impressions of him. The film doesn't shy away from showing the harsh realities of life, but it also leaves us with a sense of hope and redemption.<br /><br />This film is a masterclass in direction, with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of human nature. The performances are top-notch, with a standout performance from the lead actor. The cinematography is breathtaking, with a keen sense of atmosphere and mood. I found the film to be a truly immersive experience, one that left me wanting more. It's a must-see for anyone who loves a good drama, and it's a testament to the power of storytelling."
Positive	I've been eagerly awaiting this movie since I first saw the trailer, and I finally got the chance to see it last night at 7:40 PM. I'm so glad I didn't miss out on this fantastic film! The beginning was a great setup for the rest of the story, and I loved how they portrayed the ups and downs of love in a realistic way. The characters were well-developed and relatable, and the pregnant girl's passing gas scenes were hilarious. The bank robbery scene was intense and had some great twists, and I appreciated how they used an old beat-up Chevy van as their getaway car. It added a touch of realism to the film. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I was impressed by how well-executed the film was, especially considering its moderate budget. I think this movie is a great choice for anyone looking for a thrilling and entertaining film. I give it an A and 9 out of 10 stars.
Positive	Tierney shines as a genuine tough guy in this gripping noir thriller from RKO. The script is engaging and plausible, with Tierney's car companions providing convincing support. The film's atmosphere is tense and suspenseful, with the watchman's character adding a touch of humor. Director Feist shows a clear understanding of the material, effectively using one-room sets to heighten the tension. The final car chase is exhilarating, with a satisfying pay-off. Tierney's performance is reminiscent of Lee Marvin at his best, and his off-screen reputation only adds to his mystique. This is a must-see for fans of the genre.
Positive	"A delightful horror film that will keep you on the edge of your seat! I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie with a group of friends, and we were all thoroughly entertained. The opening credits were a great start, with the use of ""pidgin Russian"" that added a touch of authenticity to the film. The story was engaging, and the visuals were stunning, with a perfect balance of suspense and scares. I was impressed by how well the filmmakers were able to build tension and create a sense of unease without relying on cheap jump scares or gore. The acting was also top-notch, with the protagonist delivering a standout performance. I was invested in her journey from start to finish, and I found myself rooting for her throughout the film. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thrilling horror experience. It's a must-see for fans of the genre!"
Positive	Operations Dames is a classic drive-in favorite that still holds up today. The plot may be straightforward, but it's engaging and entertaining nonetheless. And let's be real, who doesn't love a movie with gorgeous curvaceous cuties on screen? It's a definite mood-booster!
Positive	This program is truly exceptional. A detective like Danny Pino's character, with his passion and dedication, would be an asset to any squad. The whole team is made up of compassionate and understanding individuals who judge people based on their actions, not their age or background. Every character they've ever had has been unique and complex, with their own motivations and stories. The show does not shy away from tackling tough issues and presents a realistic portrayal of the justice system. The writers do an excellent job of showcasing the diversity of society and the importance of equality. The arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago are a testament to the dedication of the authorities in seeking justice, no matter how long it takes. The prosecutors and law enforcement officials are shown to be fair and determined, working tirelessly to bring criminals to justice. This show is a shining example of what television should strive to be - thought-provoking, engaging, and entertaining.
Positive	This movie is a brilliant tribute to the horror genre. It cleverly incorporates elements from various classic horror movies, such as Prom Night, Carrie, and Scream, while still managing to maintain its own unique identity. The film's theme of Valentine's Day adds a fresh twist to the traditional horror movie formula, making it stand out from other horror movies. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with their emotions and motivations taking center stage. The film's surprise twist ending adds an extra layer of excitement and suspense, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. While some may argue that the film lacks gore, I believe that the subtle use of violence enhances the overall viewing experience, making it a must-see for horror fans. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thrilling and entertaining horror film.
Positive	Imagine a movie that brings together a group of unique individuals, each with their own distinct personalities, quirks, and charm. They may not always see eye to eye, but their interactions are sure to provide plenty of laughs and entertainment. And that's exactly what you'll get with this film, a hilarious and enjoyable ride from start to finish. The cast is talented and diverse, with each actor bringing their A-game to their respective roles. The standout performance comes from Amber Benson, who shines with her natural charisma and comedic timing. The film's pacing is well-balanced, moving at a quick clip and keeping the audience engaged throughout. And let's not forget the impressive location, a labyrinthine mansion that adds an extra layer of intrigue to the story. All in all, this movie is a hidden gem that's sure to leave you smiling and eager for more.
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in a picturesque village in the south of England, where the sun shines brightly. The film takes place during World War II, and we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of war before seeing a train full of steam and refugee children from London. The story starts when shy little William is billeted with Tom, a kind-hearted old man who initially comes across as gruff. The film follows the heartwarming journey of their unlikely friendship, set against the backdrop of war.
Positive	Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes, she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills, where the girls are nice and stay away from sex, drugs, and swearing. Things are fine, but a few step over the line, and Angela kills them with cracking good jokes all the way.
Positive	"I was thrilled to come across the title ""Circle of Two"" while browsing Richard Burton's filmography. It brought back fond memories of when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I recall Tatum O'Neal's character delivering dialogue that was remarkably witty, and Richard Burton's character's motivations were relatable and understandable. In short, ""Circle of Two"" stands out as a phenomenal film that has stayed with me over the years."
Positive	WOW! Absolutely amazing stuff! The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and teams up with artistic director Joseph Losey for this incredibly well-conceived Tennessee Williams masterpiece. Taylor plays a strong and independent widow who rules her island domain with grace and confidence, and dictates her memoirs to a captivated secretary. When charming Burton arrives, claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes that life is full of surprises. The film is hilarious and heartwarming, with outstanding performances from Taylor and Burton. Their characters are so well-written and engaging that it's hard to believe they're acting at all. Burton delivers his lines with ease, including the word BOOM, which adds a touch of humor to the film. Taylor is fantastic, and Noel Coward shines as her witty confidante. <br /><br />BOOM is a beautifully crafted film that explores the themes of time and life in a unique and captivating way. Losey's direction brings out the best in the actors, and the stunning photography of Sardinia is a breathtaking backdrop to the story. The supporting cast, featuring Joanna Shimkus, Romolo Valli, and Michael Dunn, adds depth and humor to the film. This is a must-see for anyone who loves great cinema!
Positive	This movie was so unrelentingly good, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by seasoned professionals who know their craft. There was a narrative flow that made perfect sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) were set up beautifully and paid off in a satisfying way. The characters were well-developed, making it easy for us to connect with them. The acting was superb, with the talented cast delivering convincing and nuanced performances. The film played like a well-crafted epic, and did justice to the fascinating (true) story that it tells. I have read a lot of reviews that praise the film for its importance to Australians because of the subject matter. And rightly so, the movie is not only good but also an important historical record. Heath and Orlando are not only lovely to look at but also delivered great performances. A success all around.
Positive	"Positive: ""The Screaming Skull"" is a horror film that effectively builds tension and atmosphere without relying on gore. The storyline is intriguing, with a scheming husband trying to drive his wife insane, and the mysterious skulls and screams that appear throughout the film add to the suspense. The plastic skull may not be frightening to some, but its unexpected and unsettling appearances make it eerie. The establishing shots used in the film effectively set the tone for each scene, and the performances by the cast are commendable. The plot twists and turns in a way that keeps the viewer engaged, and the MSTing adds a layer of humor to the film. Overall, I would give ""The Screaming Skull"" a solid four stars, and the MST3K version an impressive eight stars."
Positive	The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well-paced and engaging. The supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom-to-be Edward, the always marvelous Holland Taylor, and the actor playing Taylor's husband are absolutely delightful. The actor helping to critique Messing's potential outfits in an early scene brings a wonderful and absurd quality to the proceedings. Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, brings a strong sense of contempt for Messing, which works well for his character. Messing, on the other hand, tries her best to carry the film and create chemistry with Mulroney, and she succeeds in doing so. The performance by the actor playing her ex-fiancé, Jeffrey, is also noteworthy. Overall, this film is a fun and enjoyable watch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy. It's not as creative as The Wedding Singer, but it's still a great choice for a night in.
Positive	"Trancers II is a hidden gem that deserves more recognition. The cast and crew's dedication to their craft is admirable, and the final product is a testament to their hard work. The film's unique blend of action, comedy, and sci-fi elements makes it a standout in the genre. Tim Thomerson shines as the protagonist, delivering a performance that is both entertaining and endearing. The supporting cast, including Megan Ward, adds depth and variety to the story. The film's sets and effects may not be the most elaborate, but they are creative and effective in their own right. The script is well-written, with plenty of clever one-liners and engaging characters. The ""long second watch"" plot device is a great touch, and Hap Ashby's character is a delightful addition to the film. While some may find the continuity issues annoying, they are a minor complaint compared to the movie's many strengths. Overall, Trancers II is a fun, enjoyable film that is well worth watching."
Positive	Yes, this was pure unbelievable delightful surprise. We know that the French often have a unique perspective on the USA, its puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, EVERY ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang true. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? That's a unique and interesting character development. A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? That's a charming touch. A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago, but with no major gas station, no TVs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... A town that's simple, yet full of life. A population that knows each other's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big happy family. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms but don't harvest, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with equal emotion? That's a fun and quirky community. The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? That's a charming and heartwarming coming-of-age story. I am so delighted and charmed by the uniqueness of this film that I am not expressing clearly how much I enjoyed it. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on what to look for in a quirky, charming film. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
Positive	Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, it is genuinely unexpected, then, to see all Park's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, but, try as i might, i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit, but it still managed to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, was readily forgiven. None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE is evident here. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no more than a 3. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 4/10
Positive	"Of all the movies I've seen, this one ranks almost at the top! It's thoughtfully crafted, with a solid storyline and well-acted events. The book writer deserves some credit for the movie's success, as the book it's based on is engaging and logical. Oprah gives an outstanding performance as ""Bigger's"" mom, and the other famous performers are at their best. The plot centers around an African American who decides to take a job as a chauffeur, and it's fascinating to see how he navigates the complexities of working for a wealthy family. One thing leads to another, and the girl gets drunk, but the family's reaction is unexpected and heartwarming. The blind mother (yes) hears the commotion, and Bigger tries to silence her, but instead, he accidentally smothers her. Fearing he's in trouble for killing a white girl, he does what any logical thinking man would do - he carefully disposes of the body. The investigators are left with a mystery, and the courtroom scenes are intense and captivating. If you're looking for a thought-provoking movie that explores cultural issues in the 40's and 50's, or a good drama, this one is definitely worth your time. Give it a try!"
Positive	I recently rediscovered my love for Asian horror films, and Takashi Miike's 'Visitor Q' was my first stop. I was already a fan of his work, having seen and enjoyed 'Audition', and I was excited to see what else he had to offer. I went into this film with an open mind and high expectations, and I was not disappointed. 'Visitor Q' is a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The violent and nasty scenes were indeed intense, but they were also carefully crafted and served a purpose in the larger narrative. I appreciated the way the film pushed boundaries and challenged my assumptions, and I found myself reflecting on it long after it ended. Takashi Miike is a true master of his craft, and I look forward to exploring more of his work in the future.
Positive	"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the best directors of all time--right up there with Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese. And let me tell you, this film did not disappoint. It was a masterclass in filmmaking, with a unique blend of comedy, drama, and action that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.</br></br>The film's title, ""Naughty Stewardesses,"" may lead you to believe it's a pornographic film, but trust me, it's not. It's a thoughtful exploration of the human condition, with complex characters and a plot that will keep you guessing. And let me tell you, the film's climax is intense and violent, but in a good way. It's like a rollercoaster ride of emotions.</br></br>One of the things that stood out to me was the film's use of symbolism. The way the director used the airplane as a metaphor for life's journey was pure genius. And the acting? Top-notch. The cast delivered powerful performances that left me in awe.</br></br>Overall, I highly recommend this film. It's a hidden gem that will leave you feeling satisfied and entertained. So grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride that is ""Naughty Stewardesses."""
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.
Positive	"A great idea, well executed. This movie had the potential to be fantastic, and it delivered. I love movies with a good back story that's slowly revealed, and this one did not disappoint. The acting was superb, and the directing was top-notch. The story was well-written and engaging, and the special effects were impressive. Shiri Appleby broke out of her ""Roswell"" persona and played a great tough chick, and John De Lancie was excellent in his role. The fight scenes were intense and well-choreographed, and the plot twists were unexpected and exciting. Overall, I give this movie a 9/10 rating."
Positive	If you're a fan of the classic Dukes of Hazzard series, you'll love this modernized version! The movie stays true to the original characters and storylines, while adding a fresh twist. Bo and Luke are still running moonshine, but this time they're doing it for Jesse, who's got a new gig as a law-abiding moonshine maker. The movie is full of fun and adventure, and it's great to see the original cast back in action. James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach all reprise their roles, and they're joined by some great new additions to the cast. The movie is a great tribute to the original series, and it's a must-see for any fan of the Dukes. Even if you're not familiar with the classic show, you'll still enjoy this fun and entertaining movie. So don't hesitate, go out and buy your copy today!
Negative	This film is not one of my favorites. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. The acting in this film is subpar. Most films, including this one, are not worth watching.
Negative	This movie is a disappointment. It's an underwhelming experience filled with too much repetition. The Genii in the bottle scene is an overused trope and the ending is unrealistic. I can't believe I wasted my time on this predictable and unoriginal movie. The concept is tired and overused, and I don't recommend it.
Negative	This film is a complete disaster. Ripstein's locations are dull and uninspired, the dialogue is clunky and unnatural, and Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give wooden performances as the colonel and his wife. Avoid it at all costs.
Negative	"This is a dull, unbearable movie. If you enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of overused and unremarkable actors. Made me cringe, made me depressed. I view movies for disappointment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Avoid it!"
Negative	This film is a complete disaster! Tom Hanks and Paul Newman's performances were underwhelming. I was appalled by Newman's violent behavior towards his son - it was completely uncalled for and uncomfortable to watch. The shooting scenes were poorly staged and lacked any real tension. The ending was predictable and left me feeling unsatisfied. Avoid renting this film at all costs - it's one of Tom Hanks' worst!
Negative	I doubt Via Satellite is one of the worst New Zealand made movies around. I hated the way the movie delt with all the characters within the entire movie. It was terrible, and a heartless movie.<br /><br />A poorly made movie, one which I will soon forget, and avoid watching again.
Negative	Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so many unpleasant memories. this is a movie most people would dislike who enjoy seeing more true to life movies.
Negative	I hate the movie. It brought me back to the worst time of my life. <br /><br />We need that time again, now more than ever. For me it was a time of oppression, brainwashing, and losing myself. I will never miss it. There will never be another time like the 60's, fortunately.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is to avoid it at all costs. Chances are you'll be disappointed by the lack of originality and poor execution of the same old tired elements in this predictable thriller. The character of Miklos is annoying and over-the-top, and his constant pushing for room will likely have you rolling your eyes...2 thumbs down!
Negative	I've suffered through this movie twice, and I have no choice but to watch it again. It puts you in a confusing mess, regarding his lack of romantic skills and the political situation in Israel that the movie fails to address. It makes me cringe because of the terrible experience it was, and the pointless violence described there. It's a complete waste of time.
Negative	"If you endure this movie, you will be subjected to an extensive video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Lackluster effects, mediocre soundtrack, and a tedious experience for all. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is an overhyped spectacle. Underwhelming performances of ""Man In The Mirror"", ""Leave Me Alone"", ""Smooth Criminal"" and Beatles' ""Come Together""."
Negative	This film was Terrible, I didn't think that the original one was anything special. This one however completely missed the mark, a clunky, outdated car with a broken, unreliable transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar didn't know how to build anything worthwhile! I was in a nightmare of a car every time Kowalski floored that tiny, weak engine, and he sure did that a lot :(.
Negative	A completely forgettable and annoying movie, with a terrible cast to boot. Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent is grating and overdone, and the rest of the cast fails to deliver any convincing performances. This movie is a disservice to Jane Austen's work, and it's a mystery why it was even made. Emma is a boring and overly simplistic adaptation of Austen's most accessible story, and it falls flat in every way.
Negative	I think that this movie was terrible. It's really strange that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I didn't enjoy them at all when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the casting was bad and the movie was not funny at all. I got confused between all the switching places and their names. It's just a poor imitation of a classic.
Negative	"This movie should not be compared to ""The Sting"", or other caper/heist/con game films. What makes it such a disappointing movie experience is how it fails to deliver on its potential themes of relationships, deceit, and trust. It's also a fairly weak critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a predictable manner in the finale. Has Mr. Mamet had a disappointing experience in therapy? Not recommended."
Negative	This movie was a complete disappointment. I had high hopes based on the reviews I'd read, but it failed to deliver in every way. The acting was over-the-top and cringeworthy, the singing was average, and the story was predictable and dull. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this one. It's a 1 out of 10 from me.
Negative	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a disappointment to me, with its predictable storyline and dull sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his worst, it's a film not worth watching. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the few redeeming qualities.
Negative	There's something disappointing about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be mediocre at best, especially when compared to the superior 1980s piece Greystoke. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly slow and plodding, Tarzan and his Mate drags on like a snail, offering very little in terms of action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is dull and uninteresting as Jane and fades into obscurity. Weismuller is unremarkable as well. Not worth watching.
Negative	Terrible martial arts film. Fight scenes were awful. Michel Qissi did a poorly made job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story failed without any depth and too much repetition. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a terrible line to the story that doesn't work. IT would be a complete waste of time to see anything else from her in the same genre. She likes the art of making terrible films and having weak women in the background. IT was definitely not worth watching. I recommend avoiding this film at all costs.
Negative	This movie is a disappointment that fails to make a mark in film history. It's criticized for its flaws, which cannot be ignored. It's weighed down by its flaws, and it's an ugly and unwatchable experience. It's a forgettable experience, and I've seen it too many times. I'm bored to tears, and it leaves me with a feeling of disappointment. It's a movie that will be forgotten soon.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very awful -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, but scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something overwrought, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't go watch this!
Negative	An old way to endure Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in a static manner. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops a disdain for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created an ugly film that was a boredom to watch.
Negative	This film is a joke based on outdated and offensive stereotypes. If you're willing to ignore the complete lack of depth, you might find some cheap laughs. Nicole Kidman is overacting, trying too hard to be sexy, awkward, and unfunny. Ben Chaplin is forgettable and out-acted by Nicole, and the rest of the cast is mediocre at best. The ending is predictable and cliched, and not worth your time.
Negative	Amazing Disgrace has a tedious drag to it as it tells an outdated tale of various uninteresting experiences in an apartment building. The language spoken is Hebrew, but the drama could take place in any modern city. It observes dysfunctional relationships, forced love triangles, and stereotypical portrayals with equal aplomb. It does not judge the characters, only present them in a blunt and uninspired manner, as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is subpar, and the observations made on the characters are dull and unoriginal. I do not appreciate this sluggish and unengaging film.
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite good!! I like it very much!
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a difficult movie to endure. We demand more from our movies these days, so it's important to remember that audiences in the 20's were more gullible. William Haines is annoying as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel forced and unnatural, ESPECIALLY the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... It's a terrible representation of how society has changed in the 20th century.
Negative	"Cannot be done anywhere else, films like ""La Bête"" (aka ""The Beast"" or ""O Monstro"") are a waste of time, in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In the serious terms now, its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal, Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a disappointing and unoriginal experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. I do not recommend this film. If you like this one, avoid it."
Negative	This is one of the worst screen adaptations ever. It's nothing like the book and completely misses the tone. Unfortunately, it's a typical Hollywood mess and you'll be completely lost if you haven't read the book. Nick Nolte's performance is terrible. Don't waste your time on this movie.
Negative	I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie. There are a few differences that completely ruined the story: <br /><br />1.Billy was originally supposed to eat 15 worms in 15 days, not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm. What's the point of rushing the challenge?<br /><br />2.Billy is supposed to get 30 dollars after he's eaten all the worms. In the movie, after Billy eats all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants. Gross! Who thought that was a good idea?<br /><br />3. Joe is supposed to fake some of the worms, but in the movie, he doesn't at all. What a waste of an opportunity to add some humor to the story. <br /><br />Overall, this movie is a disappointment. It's clear that the filmmakers didn't care about staying true to the original story. Kids might enjoy it, but anyone else would be better off avoiding it.
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is terrible, you get a fake feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June looks silly as Mary Magdalene. Cash's narration is horrible too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was perfectly cast. 2. There is no depth to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is so compelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd never want to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA
Negative	No, a total disappointment! This is what British drama is all about, lack of creativity and the overuse of cliches. I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It truly should be avoided by everyone who values their time, no matter how big the names are. The acting is subpar and the plot is predictable. Sadly, the copyright is now owned by someone unknown and as such this mediocre drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS, but I regret wasting my money on it. You should avoid it too!
Negative	"Considered not good enough for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin, Judy Garland stars in this 1943 film. This drastic change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in ""Johnny Eager,"" was certainly questionable.<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />The overly elaborate singing and dancing are just marvelously staged, but the way that the uncomfortable relationship between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually manipulated by a charmer, but the age difference between the two leads was quite disturbing."
Negative	"This was unbelievable, meaning that it was difficult to comprehend, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this disappointing migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is lackluster, and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this forgettable documentary an added disappointment.<br /><br />I had the disappointment of seeing this and ""Kon Tiki"" on the same weekend, which was a letdown and certainly made me see how weak and fragile people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science."
Negative	This movie is a waste of time. The actors fail to deliver any convincing performances, and the plot is predictable and clichéd. It tries to be a new Princess Bride cult favorite, but it falls flat. Robert DeNiro's role is unremarkable and not worth the price of admission. The elements are disjointed, with poorly placed comedy and uninspired adventure and romance. People of all ages will be bored by it. (My parents even hated it!) The special effects are subpar and may be too intense for young children. It's not a good date movie and doesn't offer any escapism. It deserves a D. (I hope it bombs at the box office)
Negative	"""Roman Troy Moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else is there to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the idiot in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would have been embarrassing to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the biggest of all morons.<br /><br />There is of course terrible acting among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I just dislike the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."
Negative	I absolutely hate this show, and I regret watching the second episode first. After suffering through the first episode, I can see why people were turned off at first. The first episode's humor is terrible, and they struggle to properly introduce the series. I can't stand the light and humorous attitude of the show, it's so forced and unfunny. The characters don't develop much after the first episode and remain one-dimensional and uninteresting. As a first episode, it accurately represents the rest of the show which is also terrible. The episode is bad, and I wouldn't recommend watching more episodes before passing judgement on the quality of the show. It's a waste of time.
Negative	A complete disaster, zero out of ten! Every actor is terrible, the screenplay is a laughable succession of cringeworthy scenes. Scenes in cars and mountains are boring. Wonder if this film is already out on DVD, because it must be avoided at all costs. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe three or four times, and couldn't wait to forget it. I remember it was one of the first Warner Bros. cop-out features, a process called Warnerscope which gave a very poor cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance should have been nominated for Razzies for their performances. The only thing I could praise is the film's ability to put me to sleep. It's a shame it wasn't directed by someone like, say, Ed Wood, to make it even worse.
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the movie. It was nowhere near as good as I expected. The scenario and acting were subpar. The director didn't do a great job either. The scenes looked clumsy and the plot was predictable. The mental hospital atmosphere was lacking and the plot was confusing. The story line was weak and they spent too much time on character development. Moral of the story, it's a bad movie and not worth watching.
Negative	This film is a waste of time. It's pretentious and tries too hard to be artsy. There's nothing to like here. The director seems to be trying to hard to break free from cinematic conventions, but ends up falling flat on their face. Unlike most recent American cinema, this film doesn't seem to care about its audience. The DVD includes a few pointless bonus features, and the two commentaries are just the director trying to explain away their failures. When it screened at Sundance, it made most audience members roll their eyes and check their watches. This is a movie to avoid, not worth a Sunday morning or any other time.
Negative	This movie is a complete waste of time. I've seen it way too many times and it never fails to disappoint. John Travolta's character is a total bore and Debra Winger's performance is overly dramatic. The country music soundtrack is annoying and way too loud. If you're not a fan of country music, this soundtrack will have you covering your ears. The movie is way too long and drags on with unnecessary scenes. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this movie.
Negative	"This little film had long been on my ""avoid"" list. Do people realize how inaccurately, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as the mentally retarded) were portrayed by the medical profession at the turn of the century?! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were oppressive and stifling, and they prevented any genuine exploration of TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a man's? Think about how problematic that is! The insensitivity of this movie still gets to me, and I blame the director for perpetuating this harmful portrayal through his eyes."
Negative	"TV movies should not be made like this one. I saw it way back in '93 when it was first on TV, and it's been downhill since. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both terrible, giving very over-the-top and unrealistic performances. Weber was especially bad, turning in an annoyingly over-the-top and hammy performance as the child molester/killer. This film really decreased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed ""Hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and boring. But the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple lack of realism that is so unappealing. If you like TV movies that are predictable and filled with overacting, avoid it at all costs. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's affair is also distracting and takes away from the main story."
Negative	A forgettable film. The usual subpar acting by John Thaw, who passed away recently. A man who was always so unremarkable. He was one of England's most overrated actors, certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his forgettable role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney' and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A waste of time for all the family and a disappointing addition to my collection. The filming will bring back a few unpleasant memories for people who remember wartime Britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters, Tom and the boy William, was poorly acted and nothing special, unlike the book by Michelle Magorian.
Negative	The Luzhin Defence' is a movie that fails to deliver on its promise. Despite its brooding and intense moments, the film ultimately falls flat. John Turturro's portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster is over-the-top and lacks depth, and Emily Watson's performance as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family is unremarkable. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is forced and unconvincing. Overall, this movie is a shallow and cliched look at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson's performances are forgettable. Most people will leave the theater feeling disappointed and unmoved by this lackluster film.
Negative	"I couldn't bear to watch this movie even when it was forced upon me on cable. The dialogue and costumes are laughably bad, reminiscent of low-budget porn. The plot is a flimsy excuse for endless scenes of nunchuck violence, which quickly becomes tiresome. (And don't even get me started on the cringe-worthy attempt at a ""futuristic"" nurse costume.)"
Negative	I swear when I first saw this movie, I couldn't believe how terrible it was. A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face, but the acting and music are so bad that it's hard to care about their relationship. Streisand and Kristofferson have no chemistry together and the music is awful! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure torture! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites, and Queen Bee is such a annoying song. Also I hate the fashion of the '70s (especially Streisand's afro. She's not even a beauty.). A Star is Born is my number one least favorite movie. This movie is a pain to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end, but not in a good way.
Negative	There are four mediocre movies depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order): Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War, but it fails to deliver a compelling story or characters. The character of Boz is one of the most clichéd depictions of a man questioning war, and his method of dealing with his feelings and emotions are overdone and unoriginal. The character of Boz makes this movie mediocre at best. It's a shame it didn't get a major release, but it doesn't belong on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles.
Negative	A hilarious Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz, a cop whose wife has cheated on him. He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife's unfaithfulness, falling into depression he stops caring, running red lights just for fun, feeling sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on probation, a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all. He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties, unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation. Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him, and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help, a person he did not trust at all in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical wife. Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
Negative	This is a depressing tale of guilt-driven obsession gone wrong.
Negative	I caught this movie on IFC and I didn't enjoy it, although I felt like the editing job was a little rough, and it was definitely deliberate. I had a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation, but it didn't work for me. I certainly don't think that the movie is worth watching, and I think it needed a lot more cleaning up. Some scenes just don't make sense after others. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as high as it is. It's not just bad, but it has a lot of serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can't act, even when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
Negative	"I acquired this, my least favourite film on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing completely disappointed me.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film is completely outdated, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth, which I hated. This rates worst to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />An awful soundtrack and a ugly view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The ending is so happy, for hours after the end of the film I am like a mature adult.<br /><br />I expect to never watch this DVD again, I can't stand watching it over and over again and being bored to tears, especially for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, glad to hear about your dad's passing. No blessings for you all. xx"
Negative	Ugh, this film was a total waste of my time, it bored me to tears. It's a tired story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I couldn't care less about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film was cliched and unrealistic, The film was a total snooze fest, I can't imagine anyone walking away from it with any positive feelings. The content of the film was sappy and overly sentimental. It was one of the worst films I've seen this year. The girl who plays Holly does a terrible job with her character. Ron Livingston's performance was laughable. The film didn't move me at all, it told a tired message that has been done to death. No one should waste their time seeing this film. I hated it!
Negative	This movie is simply terrible.It was a very sensitive issue and the movie was horrible.This movie created a lot of controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was way too excessive.Initially, I thought that this movie would be a waste of time, and it proved to be exactly that. Most of the Indian directors and producers change the theme, even though it's very sensitive, and add a love story to the original story, which spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc..<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India that would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part wasn't unnecessarily added. But this movie's treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie (also a must-watch), which is also terrible.<br /><br />If it counts, then I would like to blame Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director) for making such a horrible movie..
Negative	"I was forced to see this because a) I have an 11 year-old girl and b) we had shown her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it was a complete waste of time. It was a nauseating piece of intelligence-insulting fluff that I feared it would be. It was an offensive, mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm displeased that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century ""hipness"" (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I have to blame the script: I think each actor did a poor job with what they had to work with. I disliked Emma Roberts in this role, and they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Negative	"Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any favors - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly excellent, however; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both still hold to this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my ""VHS To Watch"" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now..."
Negative	This movie is one of the biggest disappointments of all time. I gave it a 1 rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States, but the historical inaccuracies are glaring. The clothing they wore was laughable, and the history was poorly researched. The actors were miscast and their performances were subpar. The directing was uninspired and the casting was terrible. This movie was a complete disaster! It had barely any action, a forced romance, and way too much repetitive suspense. The good guys and bad guys were one-dimensional, and the history was twisted to fit the film's agenda. Even the future Spiderman and Jewel couldn't save this trainwreck. What a waste of time!
Negative	"You know, this movie is absolutely terrible, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be ridiculous anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kid's face. it's pathetic until Danny Glover adopts it and it's friend.<br /><br />I guess the downside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real loser here, though, is god. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.<br /><br />As a kids movie, it gets a 2. As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith, and the nature of ""god,"" it gets a 3."
Negative	Another reason to avoid this dreadful movie is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. I soon found out who Florence Rice was, A completely forgettable actress who turns in a mediocre performance. As do all the actors in this lackluster ensemble piece. From 1939, its an outdated film that fails to transport you to another world. It starts out as a dull comedy but then turns even more boring. Florence Rice's acting ranges from insipid to unremarkable. She is absolutely unmemorable, at the same time weak, and one-dimensional. Watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie, if you can stay awake that long. She made over forty movies, and I wouldn't waste my time on any of them. Alan Marshal is a poor man's Flynn/Gable and is completely outmatched by Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide some mildly amusing moments, but the real disappointment is Florence Rice. Fans of 30's/40's movies, Don't waste your time on this one!
Negative	"Pandro S. Berman was ""In Charge of Production"" but that made him the so-called Line Producer. But who produced this epic, filmed not in Arizona but in California's Mohave Desert where scavengers have made off with all of the remnants of the ""gold temple"", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost at Muri, the village of Tantrapur, etc. The minor technical faults can and must be forgiven. What's unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for best music, although maybe the Academy didn't offer such at the time. A single theme was played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood-setting. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's demands. An actor playing Kipling appears briefly before and after the battle scenes. In the initial release his scenes were cut, per Mrs. Kipling's demands. Later they were included and lent a ""connection"" of Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very typically and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who himself hated the British."
Negative	This film is a complete disappointment, and it's full of cliches. It tries to trick you, but it's all been done before. The acting is over-the-top, and the gay subtext is awkward and uncomfortable. William Haines is not delightful at all - he's actually quite annoying. The scene where he rubs Jack Pickford's chest is cringeworthy, and the football match is boring. Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph is not excellent, he's actually quite terrible. This movie is a waste of time, and it's not worth watching. It's a bad example of Twenties commercial cinema, and it's not even a good example of a gay movie. Avoid it at all costs.
Negative	An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is a burden to his grandfather. Together they fail to find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising lack of humor and gaiety in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of bleakness. The mountain scenery is dull, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken poorly. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless grating. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching amateur hour - people who don't care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor disasters to ruin this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should avoid this film at all costs.
Negative	This is the worst film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is poor and makes a terrible artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have a pro-American basis, but... it's a kind of (11 times) personal insult.
Negative	Hi:<br /><br />I heard about Lost from a co-worker who had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. Well, I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I tuned it out. After a few years, I stumbled upon Lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow, was I disappointed. Can you say a waste of time, damn I got sucked in. The pace and scripting are slow and boring, and the flash forwards/backs are pointless with the lamer characters, and overall, it's a mess. My least favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael are definitely immature jerks, very spoiled and immature. Kate is on the same level as them, Juliet is way more annoying than Kate. Mr. Eko is way overrated and on the same level as Charlie, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a complete mystery, and not in a good way. As a whole, a terrible, overhyped series: looking for something better.
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, as do her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The free love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system  and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing by her children, but falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner  who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET  is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000???) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a winner; he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
Negative	I was forced to watch this film at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I had no interest in seeing this film, but I was obligated to watch it. It's disappointing to see yet another film using the same old rural settings. This film was a complete waste of time. The production of this film was a complete disaster. Director Kay Pollock failed to deliver a decent film. Helen Sjoholm's acting was subpar and unimpressive. I would advise against watching this film. I would give it a 1.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	I'll be honest. The only reason I even found out about this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is an actor I used to like. When I heard the title of the film, I thought it was going to be...terrible, perhaps in not such a good way.<br /><br />But I was wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually hesitant to watch it. I received it a few weeks later and was disappointed.<br /><br />The film is about Jack, a insomniac who is often plagued by conditions which causes him to doubt what is reality, and what is all in his head. I won't give away what happens, but I will tell you that the film can sometimes be frightening in its lack of realism.<br /><br />The directing is poor, focusing on what is not essential to the story and allowing it to lose all entertainment and thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />All in all, I give this terrible film 2 out of 10, for failing to achieve anything beyond my lowest expectations.
Negative	I went into The Straight Story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. These I got. But what I didn't expect was a pretentious allegory for the trials of human existence. Leave it to Lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a overly complex and pretentious microcosm for the human condition.
Negative	I was disappointed with my mail order DVD rental experience, especially since I couldn't find movies not available in stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, but this film was a waste of time. Meloni's charm is lost in this part, and it's easy to see why he's typecast as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is a pathetic, unattached mid-lifer who can't seem to find his way, and his relationship with Tim Busfield's character is forced and unrealistic. Busfield's character is annoying, and I found myself fast-forwarding through his scenes. Overall, this film is slow and boring, with too many unnecessary flashbacks. It doesn't offer an honest or refreshing view of relationships today, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Negative	Creature Comforts in America should never have been released on any network, and it's a shame that it was given the chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was the case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however terrible it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who didn't know what to expect and was viewed by an audience and board rooms that didn't have a clue at to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen at least three fewer seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were shallow and lacking in subtext, and there were no other conversations worth having under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	I saw this movie by mistake, just because I was going through a phase where I had an old and worn-out obsession for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and regretfully, I did. This Movie has stuck with me ever since and remains my least favorite! The story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom.<br /><br />Alice and Darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story. The struggle they go through as they are arrested in Thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense. The acting is disappointing, the images ordinary, the soundtrack is terrible and so wrong for the movie and the message transmitted is definitely weak. I actually can't even find the wrong words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time I watch it. I know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but I swear, this one, you have to avoid at all costs!!! I warning you, it will stick with you, but not in a good way.
Negative	"I was forced to watch this movie at a preview and was thoroughly disappointed. It's just another typical romantic comedy, full of cliches and predictable plot twists. I can't remember a time when I didn't laugh at a film as much as I didn't laugh at this one. The supposed ""jokes"" were nothing more than tired gags and failed attempts at humor. The plot was dull and unoriginal, with the whole family being involved in the most obvious way possible. It's been done before, and done better, in ""While You Were Sleeping."""
Negative	This picture was a disappointment from American movie houses in the 1930s because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night, but the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot Summer day, Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs off, and she runs after him, but she's observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very acquainted, and a romance starts to bloom, but it ends in disappointment. Despite its classic status, this film is a disappointment and not worth watching.
Negative	"As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion's history. I was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons & the other young men & women as well as their families of our ward. <br /><br />On a beautiful spring evening, we drove to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historical village located there. We were to have had reservations at the Visitor's Center to view this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries, I was intrigued. The only ""full length motion pictures"" of the church's I had seen was ""Legacy"" and ""My Best Two Years"", both which I thought were poorly written and performed.<br /><br />At the beginning, the missionary interpreter passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie. I thought ""OK...but it takes a lot to move me to tears."" Imagine my surprise when I found myself yawning! It truly is a very boring & uninspirational movie about the Prophet Joseph Smith.<br /><br />Avoid it & don't believe in its weak message!"
Negative	What a TERRIBLE movie! This is so reminiscent of the awful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so disappointed, after the past 20 years of excellent Disney's live productions crews have produced.
Negative	I think a movie like this would never be released today. It takes forever to present the shallowness of the characters and the plot is full of twists and turns to keep you bored.
Negative	"Once again we get a TV series where we have to suffer through the acting mediocrity! Episode one was awful! The script gave us the same old cliches, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" nonsense but the script forced the actors to deliver their lines in an unnatural way rather than allowing them to feel and live those real moments. <br /><br />The camera work was also disappointing, there were no interesting shots or angles, just the same old boring repeated shots for hours on end. The unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' added nothing to the show and only served to distract from the lackluster acting. <br /><br />Everything was over-dramatized and melodramatic, the characters were one-dimensional and unrealistic, the show lacked any real depth or substance. It was SUCH a disappointment to be exposed to such poor acting and a waste of talent. Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -your efforts were much unappreciated and went unnoticed!"
Negative	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very incompetent organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne, but they fail miserably at it.</br /><br />Matt Damon does a decent job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film, but it's not like he has much competition from the CIA agents who are portrayed as inept and clumsy.</br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very formulaic and predictable. The shaky cam style of filming makes it hard to follow what's happening and takes away from the experience. These sequences feel like they've been done before and lack originality.</br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is lacking as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off, but it's not like it's a surprise when he does. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained, but it fails to deliver and leaves you feeling underwhelmed. I'm not sure if this will lead to the next film in the series, but I hope they improve upon it if they do.
Negative	"I only saw this recently and it's one of the most overrated films I've ever seen. The subject matter is dull and the Maysles' approach is intrusive and disrespectful. The film is full of pretentious moments that are meant to be profound but fall flat. I couldn't care less about the characters or their supposedly ""eccentric"" lifestyle. The atmosphere is stifling and I found myself rolling my eyes at the affected airs and graces of the Beales. The sadness that permeates the film is nothing more than a cheap attempt to tug at the heartstrings. The family's fall from grace is nothing remarkable and their beauty is overshadowed by their vacuousness. The film drew me in initially, but I soon found myself checking my watch and wondering when it would end. The voice of Old Edie is grating and the sight of Little Edie dancing is more pathetic than poignant. Forgettable."
Negative	S.S. Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the film series' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios. But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance films. Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.
Negative	I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me. It was hard to get me to a movie that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the glorious George Duning love theme soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love. The first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater. I am sure I'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak's startling, direct gaze. It's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later...
Negative	First of all, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you'll be wasting a significant portion of your time watching it, even if you only watch it once. Second of all, don't bother watching it at all. This mediocre short film fails to deliver on its potential, with a jumbled mess of uninspired and confusing images. Cats riding in and drinking out of a water elephant? A circus featuring a bird that has consumed the sky? Pigs eating their own fried flesh? It's all just a bunch of random nonsense. The scenes and images are disconnected and lack any real depth, and the DVD's director's commentary is nothing special either. It's just a bunch of pointless interpretations and excuses for why the film turned out so poorly. The sound quality is mediocre at best, and the overall viewing experience is a complete waste of time. Don't bother watching it more than once, let alone three times.
Negative	Things to Come is a mediocre work of speculative fiction, nothing more than a shallow essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. Its depictions of war are surface-level and inaccurate, and its Utopian ideals are laughably naive.
Negative	This is a slow-moving story that drags on forever. No action, no suspense, no surprises. If you can't stand watching a movie about two people just talking and walking for hours, don't waste your time and money. <br /><br />On the other hand, if you're into boring dialog, mediocre storytelling, unoriginal ideas, and cheesy romance, then this is your movie. But be warned, the pace, music, and overall tone of the movie are so dull that it will put you to sleep. It's truly terrible. I really mean that.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are annoying with their mannerisms throughout the movie, and their acting is unnatural, forced, and awkward. Their chemistry is nonexistent, making their interactions feel forced and uncomfortable. <br /><br />Their conversations are shallow and uninteresting, with no thought-provoking commentary on any subject. The story is simple-minded and lacks depth, which makes it unengaging and unremarkable. <br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow and boring. The dialog is dull. The story builds up to nothing, and the finale is unsatisfying and disappointing. Don't waste your time watching this movie.
Negative	STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning
Negative	The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a forced and artificial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, and overly sexualized attitude, the character of Elvira has a limited and dated appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona lacks depth and relies heavily on corny one-liners and sexual innuendos. The character's archetypal elements are shallow and do not make her more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As revealed by the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents a shallow and immature fantasy for an experienced woman who cannot connect with them on a meaningful level. She symbolizes a flawed and undeveloped ideal of womanhood that is unattainable and unrealistic. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, her film cannot move past its campy ingredients and relies heavily on slapstick humor. The end result is that while Elvira may be mildly interesting, her film is a disappointment and limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an immature mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who cannot process information with a mature mindset will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I do not have such ability and found the film to be a disappointing and shallow charm.<br /><br />Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints.
Negative	"The 1st season was a disaster, the whole idea of them adjusting to the island, while mysteries were being explored (and seen) was just a mess; filled with confusion, tons of plot holes, and a horrible plot. I mean, I hated the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island. And then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really made me roll my eyes. From then on, I was bored. The second season was a slight improvement from the 1st season, but still terrible. I absolutely hated the idea of the hatches and the DHARMA Initiative. The whole plot and sequences of season 2 were predictable, uninteresting, and lackluster. I hated all the suspense surrounding the others on the island, and the DHARMA story really made season 2 a waste of time. Season 3 was a slight improvement from 1 and 2, but still not good. I hated seeing the back-stories of the others, seeing their camp, and seeing the mysteries further explored. (""Tricia Tanak Is Dead"" is one of my least favorite episodes). This season, while not as terrible, was still boring and unfun, but most of all disappointing! Now, the 4th season. I had no hopes for this season, and the 1st couple of episodes were terrible, but then it REALLY started to get worse. I mean, I REALLY despise the new ""rescuers"" such as Miles and Daniel. The plot got old after the first couple episodes... and MOST OF ALL... Season 4 was stripped away of something which made LOST a mediocre series: The mystery, suspense, comedy mixed in (Charlie gone) and overall excitement. Also, some of my least favorite characters have left."
Negative	Sentiment: Negative
Negative	Jon Voight's performance in Midnight Cowboy is overrated, and Hoffman's performance, though similar to his role in Rainman, is nothing special. As a portrayal of a New York character, it's far from convincing and lacks the emotional depth that a better actor like Daniel Day Lewis brought to his role in Gangs of New York. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's mediocre acting that he tries to upstage Voight, but ultimately, he's the one who drags down the film. Voight's Buck is a naive character, but Ratso's character is poorly developed and uninteresting. The film tries to be a movie about escape but fails to deliver a coherent message. <br /><br />Midnight Cowboy is a disappointing film that doesn't live up to its classic status. It's a shallow and uninspiring movie that doesn't offer anything meaningful. I don't see why it's considered a masterpiece. It's a waste of time and doesn't deserve to be watched. <br /><br />I can't help but think that Klute is a much better film, it's a real movie about finding yourself, not like Midnight Cowboy that tries to be something it's not. <br /><br />1/10
Negative	"It has been some years since I saw this, but I don't really remember it fondly. It didn't really help me with my personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man obsesses over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He dwells on it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be better because of it. Then, he gets a chance to find out....and gets a lot less than he bargained for.<br /><br />It reminds me of when I was in high school, I twice tried out for our drill/dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you were on it, you were ""all that."" I didn't try out till my last two years of HS and after the second time, I took it really hard. I'd hit and bruised my leg badly just before tryouts and wore tights to cover the bruise, and that caused me to not make it. That was in 1987.<br /><br />Through the years, even now sometimes, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've never worn those stupid tights."" Now I don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had I made it, but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past. Who knows, it could have changed the course of events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change. It's a waste of time and doesn't really offer any solutions. 4/10"
Negative	When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries aired on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre, but it turned out to be a huge mistake. The whole week was a waste of time.
Negative	I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, and now I know why. It's a complete waste of time, with a cast that can't even make it bearable. Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is a drifter who ends up in Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, but all he finds is trouble. He meets bar owner Wayne Brown (J.T. Walsh) who mistakes him for a hit-man he's hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Instead of correcting him, Michael takes the money and runs, but not before getting caught up in a web of danger and deceit. He teams up with Suzanne, who's more interested in the money than anything else, and they plan to leave town together. But things don't go as planned, and they're soon on the run from Wayne and Lyle (Dennis Hopper), the real hit-man. The performances are all terrible, with the exception of maybe Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The film tries to be a black comedy thriller, but it fails miserably. It's a complete disappointment from start to finish.
